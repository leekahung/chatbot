bdzdhy,"To further clarify. We only allow the roasting of human adults. Stop posting pictures of your cats, dogs, chickens, fursonas (yes this has happened more often than you think), or cathedrals. It's not as funny or unique as you think it is, and it's not going to get approved.",Someone has actually posted a picture of a chicken and said Roast Me? ,7061
d2diaf,"#AND #ARM -- We receive so many confused modmails about why your roast was rejected. It's because you're giving us a floating hand. We need to see *an unbroken meat tube between the Roastee's upper torso and the sign that they are holding*. This ensures consent, and eradicates almost any possibility of Photoshop, or holding a sign in front of your friend, or in front of a photo. This is important. This keeps the subreddit fun. So please, when submitting a roast please ensure it includes your hand **and your arm**. Please. We're so tired of having this conversation. -- ETA: We've gotten a couple comments about ableism and I just want to address that. If you don't have hands or arms or can't use your hands or arms we do make case by case exceptions to the rule. We just need to be 100% certain that the person in the photo is presenting the sign to us. Can't do that with floating hands.","> an unbroken meat tube  Oh boy, this could turn out to be a grave misunderstanding.",6956

You give off the vibe of the proverbial ""Don't say just 'Hi'"" girl on Tinder who does exactly that when messaging anyone. You are so attention starved that your grandparents, with whom you live, are about to move you into assisted care living facility, because just like an elderly person who has lived well past its time, you're just making everyone feel uncomfortable at dinner and shitting up the place.",12011
