6kfzpq,"Background story: I've been dating my current girlfriend for almost a year. In fact, we are celebrating our anniversary next month. She's a wonderful person who has been nothing but fully supportive of whatever I do. I've started a low carb diet and lost around 40 pounds in 6 months. While everyone was criticizing it (oh you need carbs, this is unhealthy, blah blah blah), she was there for me through and through. In fact, she got on the same diet and lost 5 pounds just so we both have the same routine and plan. Throughout my weight loss journey, she'd always compliment me and make me feel better about myself (I kind of had some self-esteem issues). I've reached my weight goal a few weeks ago and I'm over the moon. I've been hitting the gym to gain muscle, joined and completed marathons, but the most surprising out of all was the attention I've been getting from women. Something that never happened before.  So last night, I was out with a few friends without the gf. She claimed to have a headache, but I'm pretty sure she's planning our anniversary (she loves planning stuff). I get to the bar, and there were a bunch of people that I haven't seen since highschool 10 years ago. One of which was a cute girl I remember from back then. I was chatting with her throughout the whole night. She was so amused by my weight loss and she told me how she wants to become a nutritionist and help people out. We had so much in common that made me lose track of how much I drank. Since I'm on low carb, alcohol gets me drunk so much faster. Everyone gets drunk also and decides to head back to the girls place. I, on the other hand, was completely wasted so I can't remember most of what happened. I woke up in the morning with one hell of a hangover, and my friend filled me up with all the events from last night. I was mortified. Apparently, they all got pizza and I ate a whole meat cravers pan crust with extra cheese pizza all by myself. I can already see the disappointment in my gfs face.  What's your cheat story?","The moral of the story is: Work up an appetite wherever you want, but eat at home. ",25849

That summer a little red finch perched himself outside my window every morning and would sing. I called him Charles and He helped me get up in the morning and face the day. I would wake up, wish him a good morning, have a cup of coffee with him and then get about my day. About a month later I saw this little gal finch start showing up nearby when he would sing in the morning. Bro had moves. About a week later they stopped showing up. Get it Charles.

I’m wondering as your wealth grew, or you became ‘rich’, what changes occurred that you did not expect? EDIT: I’m getting a lot of “what about wealthy women?”  questions. I just want to say, I am asking males because I’m a male myself so I feel their experiences to be more relatable, this is the r/askmen sub and you are very free to ask women the same question on the r/askwomen sub. No sexist intentions, just find males more relatable in this context. ","Things haven’t changed much for me. Neither friends nor family hit me up for money. I dress like a slob. I only work when I want to but that has gotten me complacent. Women don’t throw themselves at me nor do I think they’re after my money. I travel a lot. I almost never cook for myself. I default to ordering in or picking up fast food. I love fancy restaurants. I still struggle to spend money on some things. And yet on other things, I’ll drop thousands of dollars without blinking.  The biggest change for me has been motivation. I used to love working and now I’m struggling to be excited about anything.  The biggest challenge is teaching my kids how to be self-sufficient. I had house cleaners and cancelled the service. We do our own house chores. I do my own yard work. I still want them to have pride in ownership and recognize that there isn’t a magical money tree.

Spoons and bowls nested, things placed in the racks crosswise or in racks that are way too tight for them, dishes put into the racks in random sequence rather than with like dishes, glasses put in sideways, bowls balanced precariously such that they'll tip up and catch all the dirty water, etc, etc, etc.  It's never the same way twice, either.

9vmibe,"I was at my local gym this morning, and saw a cute girl using the squat machine. I took a few glances while in between sets, and caught eye contact a few times, so figured I'd say something the next time I walked past her. As I finished a set and went to get some water, I walked by her and saw her smile at me. It literally broke my brain and I forgot how to function. I made some weird audible noise and froze before turning around. I couldn't help but laugh at myself as I walked away, but Jesus, her smile was enchanting!

I'm a big ball of anxiety and introverted.  I walked up to her and said ""INCOMPREHENSIBLESOUND*""  "" HOLY SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT BRAIN?!? FUCK YOU BRO"" I thought.  She just looked at me and said ""What?"" I said ""INCOHERENTMUMBLE*""  I almost just walked back to the table.  I couldn't help but grin and cringe a bit, because I was fucking it up this badly.  Then I finally said something coherent.  ""Uhhh, my bad about that I uhhh don't really do this much, but clearly I'm at a loss.  I was wondering if I could buy you a drink and get to know you a little bit?""   She said ""I'm actually here with my friends and I should get back to them.""

9xb11g,"Never had anyone to teach me these things, so looking for Reddit guidance.  Thank ","Look at the bolts that connect the panels to the vehicle. They come painted the same color as the car from the factory. If the paint is chipping, or it looks like there's been a wrench on them, that could indicate that bodywork was done on the car and the panel has either been readjusted or replaced. Make sure the VIN behind the windshield matched the VIN on at least one other panel (ex: driver door) and also the title. Look for rust that is perforated on either the body or frame of the car. As others have said: tire condition, tire brands, and mismatched tires will give you a good indication of previous ownership. Pull the oil cap and look inside with a flashlight. Look for sludge or coolant mix. Basically make sure the oil looks clean and smooth. Red flags would be a metal shavings or a frothy or chocolate milkshake appearance. Crank up the car, open the hood, and just take a few moments to listed to the engine. Some sounds are normal, but listen for loud tapping or clunking sounds. When you test drive the car, keep the radio off. If you can, keep the ac/heat off as well (test them separately). Drive the car both carefully and aggressively to put it under different loads. If its an automatic transmission, listen and feel carefully for slipping or jumping of gears. And watch the tachometer for over revving. If it's a manual, listen and feel for grinding, or getting stuck/popping out of gear. During you test drive, make sure the odometer turns at least one full mile. Watch for smoke when accelerating. Bluish smoke indicates that the car is burning oil through the exhaust, and dark/black smoke indicates serious major engine problems. \*EDIT: Black smoke will be normal on some diesel vehicles. If possible, always test drive the car with the engine cold. There are some mechanical issues that ""go away"" after the engine and transmission are warmed up. Some sellers know this and will warm the car up before showing it. There are a lot more tips and resources out there. I would recommend going on YouTube and checking out a channel called ChrisFix. He has posted a series of videos on buying used cars and has a checklist you can download. Not all of the information is perfect, but it is really helpful for beginners. Source: I was a buyer for major auto dealership for 3 years. &#x200B; EDIT\* One more thing to add, download the ""myCARFAX"" app. It's free, and you can scan the VIN and it will show you all of the *reported* maintenance and repairs on the vehicle.

acgtkx,"Since my teenage years I remember having a bitter attitude towards my birthdays because they signified another year of my life had passed. Now as a 23 year old guy this feeling of time fleeting has only grown stronger as every person I talk to in their 40’s, 50’s etc always has the same remark: “it feels like just yesterday I was your age”. I’ve been suffering from somewhat of a quarter life crisis outlined by nihilism, depression, and loneliness. While my therapist has definitely been helping as well as starting to meditate, I can’t seem to shake off that thought that all my progress and memories will eventually have a definitive end. These feeling are exasperated by my analytical, introspective, and logical nature. As a software engineer who relies on my thinking for my job, it’s hard for me to draw then line between which thoughts of mine are helpful and which are detrimental to my wellbeing. I want to just be like some of my friends who just live life and “do what feels good”, but it seems like I’ve been cursed to overthink things. Has anyone else dealt with similar struggles and if so what helped you?","You’re in a tough cycle because someone with your thought process will require a lot of work to change the way you think. The way that I cope with that idea is that I literally just just put myself out there to do what ever I can. I know I will die one day so I have to make the most of everything. Enjoy the family time, enjoy the time with friends, make a mistake but laugh at it, don’t dwell on it. If your job is stressful, try find a new one that isn’t as stressful, take time to eat well, enjoy watching TV, appreciate the little things because the little things mean a lot, don’t have huge expectations because they nearly always get knocked down. Try an make a memory with everything you do. There’s something’s I won’t do like go on theme park rides because they scare me, but I’m happy to know that if I die today that I haven’t missed out on that part of life because that never interests me. The fact that death is certain in life is something you just need to accept and instead of worrying about it, do the things you want and have as many memories as you can to the point you can say, “yeah, I’ve done enough”. Im 22, 23 in May, I try and make the most of all the little things, want nothing more than family time or going to the pub with my mates and that’s what keeps me happy and how I cope with the fact that I will die one day so let’s just enjoy the little things ",4642

auy7p7,"For me, the cake definitely goes to that one time I was was told by a woman in line at the drug store, out of the blue, that she used to breastfeed me.

Glad to see so many females share in this.",Focus on their nose and above. You have peripheral vision to the top and bottom of your focus as well and if you see their cleavage in your vision you’re going to be tempted to look. If you can avoid looking below their nose you’ll be less tempted to glance down. Generally eye contact expresses sincerity and respect so it helps me build comfortable relationships as well as avoids awkwardly getting caught looking.

I always thought that you needed to be in love with someone in order for a relationship to work out, but I guess it really depends. There really is no right or wrong answer to whether or not this holds true. Based on the comments, it’s different for everyone. Reading these responses brought so many more questions to mind and unfortunately, I saw that it also made people question the depths of their relationship with their current or potential significant others. I sincerely apologize to those in which my post made them feel doubtful/insecure about their current/future relationships. I can see how this could discourage one from loving someone or being in a committed relationship. I never intended to make anyone feel that way. Love is an amazing feeling and is something people should all experience at least once in their life so I hope this post does not scare you from embracing it if given the chance – however, do know that nothing is guaranteed to last. That also applies to the pain that follows afterwards if and when it comes to an end. Anyway, thank you so much r/AskMen – including women - for participating in this discussion. I’m sorry I wasn’t able to reply to all of you but know that your input is appreciated.  Edit 2: Aaahhhh!! My first gold!? Thank you so much who ever you are!!!

I would love to respond to each and every one of you but I just don’t have the time. For anyone that is truly struggling with feelings similar to mine I always advise trying to work on things first. Relationships can be very difficult and communication is absolutely key. Make sure you check out The Five Love Languages, it can really make a difference in how we communicate with each other. If you feel you have tried and your needs still aren’t being met you have to decide when enough is enough and that’s different for each individual. Just know that because your partner isn’t meeting your needs doesn’t mean there is something wrong with you",11777

csc4c7,So last night at the club I saw a bride and groom come in straight from the wedding while still wearing their dress and suit. He looked a little overwhelmed. She just immediately hit the dance floor and started grinding on random guys.

ctg9if,"I'm done with fighting for something that I don't even want in life simply because others tell me it's normal and attractive. Not everyone is destined for greatness, and in fact this whole thing felt like a charade to me, given that the majority of people end up being mediocre, not standing out in any regard for their whole lives. Giving up has been the most freeing experience for me as a man. Why do I ask the question in the title ? Some time ago at a friends wedding, I met a woman so passionate about her work that I lost myself in time in admiration of her. We king of got off, and she asked me out for a date, but lurking on twox, askwomen and relationship advice, I've reached the conclusion that I'm part of the undesirables, I am the type of man without any drive in life, and I am the type of man many women regret wasting their lives with. I don't feel bitter about it, and respect this desire, but it feels fair that I make this known to her as early as possible, as to not make her think I've been using her or misleading her. How do I do this without being self-deprecating, self-defeating ? Without humiliating myself or her in the process ? **EDIT:** Thank you all for your kind words. It has helped brightened my day knowing that being simple isn't really that bad.","This is the epitome of the phrase ""I'm a simple man with simple needs"". You've found contentment and that's not settling, it's humble happiness. You have only gratitude for what you have. Referring to it as mediocrity diminishes the sheer privilege that is a full belly, good friends and a sunset. Being happy with that doesn't mean you're not capable of pursuits, they just aren't likely to be you becoming an Olympian. It means you're more likely to want to be a decent cook, handy with a hammer and nails, etc. And these simple things can be real joys and true lifelong passions that will never lead to riches or fame, but they are still great selling points on a date. Don't downplay your happiness or the joy you already have. Finding a partner who is easily pleased makes for a happy life. She'd be lucky to score a guy like you. Go win her heart and enjoy your life your way my friend.",7162

dac1iv,"So I’ve got a couple male friends and I cook way more than either of them. Like two weeks ago I made a cake for the hell of it, I made lasagna bolognese on a date, made a chocolate cheesecake for a friend’s birthday, etc. One of them has home meal delivery, so simple stuff to cook, and the other doesn’t cook at all. The one who doesn’t cook at all is constantly jealous of how I have good food and then today said he thinks if my childhood had gone differently I could easily be gay because of how much I like cooking. I’m just thinking that might be the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard from him. I have yet to have any woman be opposed to my cooking and most find it really cool that I’m decently good at it. Edit: It’s not that I think it’s not masculine, until probably a year ago I’d never heard cooking grouped with feminine things. So I’ve never believed that’s it’s not masculine. I’m more wondering how people can be that stuck in that mentality of masculinity that they won’t try cooking just because they have a distorted perception. And then critic those who do. Also as everyone seems to be mentioning restaurant chefs I went and looked and it was 81% male in 2012. I didn’t realize it was that male dominated but definitely bringing that up if anyone mentions it again, as well as how essential it is, and apparently sexy too. Now about how to take advantage of that...",It’s weird because being a chef is considered manly but cooking at home is seen as a woman’s job,5855

That's not just a saying, it's an actual function of our brains. There's an area called the association cortex which is responsible for collecting information that fits our mood and world view. That's why you get a confirmation bias when you think you can't accomplish something and fail - and of course you reaffirm it by telling yourself ""I told you so!"" And I'm no stranger to this. The reason I know about it in detail is because I struggled with depression and alcohol addiction for almost a decade. And ten years ago, my attitude was very similar to OP. So believe me when I tell you that you do have talents. You just lost the ability to recognize them and the confidence to discover them. &#x200B; It's not easy to combat this. A lot of therapists recommend a happiness diary. And before you label that as eccentric bullshit, just hear me out. I changed it a little bit into a success diary that I keep on me at all times. I write down anything I view as a success, no matter how trivial it is. That starts with getting up in time and making the bed. Or a nice and friendly conversation in the subway. Motivating myself to go to the gym. A nice evening with the missus. And holy shit, most of the time it's not even noon and I already filled a whole page. And every time I write down something new, I'm being greeted by past successes. &#x200B; That's a very simple step to improve how you feel about yourself. Additional steps include trying new activities and stepping outside of your comfort zone, allowing yourself to succeed and accepting defeats and failures.

e8cdwo,"I was reminiscing about past romantic playthroughs, as I usually do because playing IRL in single player mode tends to keep you stuck on certain levels, and realized I was a pretty shitty ass boyfriend to ""the one that got away"". What's worse is that I actually thought I was a good boyfriend because we just almost never fought about anything, so I took that as indicative of a healthy relationship. She was, however, one of the most patient angels I was unaware of having met.  One of the more memorable moments I'm hung up on that I look back on in disgust is this one time where she was driving to my house and her car broke down in the middle of the street late at night by the 7/11 that was a 5 minute walk from my house, or a 2 MINUTE DRIVE from my house. She called me with concern in her voice, almost trembling, saying she needed help pushing her car off the street. I told her to put it in neutral and push it to the side then to call a tow truck or something. I'm so ashamed to say that she complied with what I said in the sweetest and most understanding ""okay"" I've ever heard. The reason I didn't want to go and help was because I was fucking playing ranked Gears of War.....can you believe that shit? What's worse, is that I justified my decision by telling myself that she's a grown woman and should be able to handle it herself...man, if I could go back and kick my ass....Luckily some stranger was kind enough to help her get it off the street. She then proceeded to wait for both her dad and the tow truck all while she was texting me at home...2 minutes away. I've reflected and grown as a person since then, but man I still can't believe how shitty that was of me.","One of the things she told me after we broke up was that dating me felt more like being a mother than being a girlfriend, and I dwell on that a lot.",8661

eevnpv,"My husband was assaulted by someone on the street when he was walking home tonight. Seems like the other guy was looking for a fight.  Accused my husband of something innocuous and then proceeded to badger him down the entire block, shoving him, and knocked him down once. My husband chose not to engage. Thought the guy was maybe homeless and had mental health issues and etc.  Didn’t want to escalate.  Just kept walking.  Eventually found an open restaurant and went inside and waited there until the jerk was long gone and then continued on his way. He felt nervous the rest of the way home. He is rattled, enraged, and shaken.  He tells me he feels like less of a man because he didn’t fight back (for context he’s a big hockey player).  This is his main feeling.  He hates that someone made him feel small and vulnerable and scared. And that he “allowed” it by not fighting back. He feels ashamed. He feels so much shame that he made me promise to never tell anyone about this because he doesn’t want to be perceived as a softie, or unmanly. I can cognitively understand how he feels, but it’s hard for me to empathize completely as a woman because our lived experiences are so different.  I feel like he was clearly the better man here. I feel like he showed judgement, restraint and even some compassion.  This guy was spoiling for a fight and my husband didn’t give it to him. The jerk didn’t get what he wanted. My husband won.  And I don’t know about this other guy but my husband has a pretty ideal life. I feel like he has won in a lot of ways. I just listened. I agreed with everything he said. I validated every feeling. I told him that I can imagine how scary it was and how I understand his rage. I also tried to provide him with my perspective a little, so he knows that at least he is not less of a man to me. That he is in fact, greater. He doesn’t want me to touch him. He’s now downstairs trying to cool off by watching TV and having a drink. This has never happened to him before. He’s having a really hard time processing it. I wish he would talk to some of his guy friends about this but he won’t.  I’m worried he’s going to just bottle up all his anger and perhaps explode on someone undeservedly.  I’m also worried that he’ll feel scared walking at night for the foreseeable future.  What is the best way I can support him?  To dos?  Do not dos? EDIT1/UPDATE: I did not expect to get so many responses. Thank you. There is too much to reply to so I can’t answer all the specific qs - but quick update. I really appreciate insights so many of you shared - explaining the reasons he is feeling shame or fear and how he might be processing it (or not).  It’s different from how I think so I am so grateful for the little window into his brain.  I also REALLY appreciate the advice on ways I can best support him.  I took screen shots of a bunch of your comments re what to perhaps say or not say.  I definitely heard loud and clear to give him space. I also heard from some of you how similar incidents have stayed with you for a long time.  I am just worried about him and wanted to make sure that I am helping and not hurting.  Really. Thanks again. EDIT2: Eek there is so much to respond to. Will update on the rest of it later but for right now, I’m getting some aggressive messages about how I shouldn’t have posted this because my husband asked me to keep this private. I understand that viewpoint. I think I was thinking that this is anonymous and that this was one way I could get some insights/advice from men without asking anyone who actually knows me or my husband (he isn’t on Reddit). I will absolutely delete this after I’ve read and digested. Thanks for the reminder. EDIT3:  So believe it or not I have read through a huge proportion of these comments via my inbox.  Some of you disagree with my husband’s course of action and that’s fine. From my perspective what’s done is done and I’m concentrating on moving forward. Thank you to everyone who offered to chat with my husband and those of you who shared going through a similar experience. You men have to go through some tough shit.  I said it before but it’s worth saying it again, I’m really blown away by all your insights. SO much that I never considered - like what it might feel like for a man to have to come face to face with the reality that maybe they aren’t a hero/can be vulnerable (as a woman, I frequently feel vulnerable, for example). Also so many of you mentioned martial arts of some kind - especially Brazilian Ju Jitsu which I’ve never heard of and had to look up. Super interesting. Will definitely bring that up.  This entire thread has been extremely helpful to me. I literally took notes. Thank you to all of you, truly.  I’m sorry I wasn’t able to reply to anyone directly.  But I very very much appreciate everything you’ve shared.  Merry Christmas.","His gut instinct told him not to engage.  Once he was out of that situation his mind decided to play what if scenarios.

In the comments down below you can find an explanation from me about how that phrasing happened.  Edit 2 for the added explanation from down below:   I read the same question with ""hypersensitive women"" on askwomen and found it to be super interesting and really wanted a male perspective on it. i agree that it is unfortunately less common for males to share their feelings. i thought that if i phrase it with sensitive instead of hypersensitive, maybe more males would feel open to talk about it, and don't feel off for being ""unusal"" even though they are not.  Also on the female thread a thing i noticed was that alot of the behaviours getting pointed out aren't hypersensitive, they are just made felt like they are being hypersensitive to push responsibility away from their partners.  That's why i decided to say 'sensitive' instead of hypersensitive, not to make people feel like they are wrong for having feelings etc.   i do agree tho now that it can sound a bit mocking and it was not intended to be this way. Simply wanted shared feelings of getting upset , without silly answers such as 'she wont suck my dick 24/7 huehuehue'","This was an issue with an ex: She constantly came down on me for not opening up, but when I actually did open up and talk about what was bothering me she would get mad because she couldn't relate to it. Took me a while to figure out that she wanted me to have similar worries/stresses to her, which were more along the lines of things that HAPPENED to her that she needed to vent about, whereas I was worried about things that had yet to happen (job prospects, life decisions, financial struggles) and was unsure how to proceed. This type of indecision and vulnerability was not something she wanted to see from me so she would dismiss my issues outright.

As a result I've become much more confident in myself.  For the record, this is a process years in the making--if you're looking to improve yourself, it can take a while.  Depends on how far you have to go. If this specific scenario doesn't apply to you(either via work or school), then remove yourself from the dating pool entirely.  Get in the mindset of ""I'm going to work on myself, and not waste anyones time until I'm happy with who I am"".  It's a bit extreme, but if you're serious about self improvement, it can be a major step in the right direction. Everyones different, and what worked for me might not work for you, but this was my experience.",4951

The shot can last as long as 13 years but you can remove yourself from the birth control at anytime. It has had a few human trials but is not yet fully functional and has not been released for public use. My question is that if this was provided, would you be interested in having your own birth control? Perhaps allowing your partner to remove herself from hormonal birth control and give her body a break? Ensuring you can never be trapped with a fake pregnancy or a condom ripping? Keen to hear your thoughts. &#x200B; EDIT: Just to clarify, condoms are still the only contraception that protects against STDs/STIs.

fba8ej,"(F here) Would it be appropriate to expect a boyfriend to wear a condom until youre ready to have kids or am I *expected* to use other contraceptives after some time?  I know sex with and without condom differs but all I've heard is that condoms basically take out 80% of the pleasure. If I could, I'd rather not take the pill or use IUD's. So is it true? Does condoms take away all the pleasure?","Your first question, it's up to you. Condoms are safer, the only downside would be the loss of sensation on the penis.  Still, it's better than the negative impacts of some contraceptives and STI or STD. Raw sex is definitely much better than with a condom. But again, it's up to you. An ex of mine had an arm implant. The sex was amazing but the apparent side effects (moods, longer periods, etc) became apparent to both of us. I offered to use condoms but she refused. Don't put pressure on yourself.",10711

Further into the interview, I was asked what the difference between a Data Scientist and and Data Analyst was, and I said the most textbook answer I could and said, I'd consider a Data Analyst like a Nurse and a Data Scientist like a Doctor. The analyst will have lots of experience with front-end analysis and observation, while the scientist will be more adept at in-depth why's, predictions, etc. (Which is why one is paid x2-3 the other).

To this day, I still love my sister as a family. Anyway, my sister often volunteered to get mails from mailbox outside of the house. She does this because she want to be the first to tell my parents that our school sent letter probably about suspension from bus or school for something I tried to hide from my parents.  So, one day outside on Saturday morning, I rode my bicycle and I saw a garter snake on ground. It was small one-footer pencil thin snake. I picked up the snake into one of cargo pockets in my pant and rode back to home for lunch. As I was nearing to home, I took snake out and placed into our empty mailbox. I ran into house and I looked through window for mail to arrive. My sister saw me and she became suspicious. She shouted to mom that she's getting mail and ran toward to our mailbox. I watched through window with huge smile the snake jumped into her romper and it crawled out through one of her legs. Fast forward today, my sister won't open mailbox anymore.

Now I'm imagining him growing up and forgetting me and it's like I'm breaking up all over again. I love him and I'm grieving for the future that I thought I'd have with him. It hurts to think about all of the times he'd sit on me watching TV or him reaching for my hand while walking. Men of Reddit who have gone through this, how do you move past it? EDIT: Incase it's not clear I'm not interested in hearing from you if you're using this as a means to push your outdated, bruised fruit ideology and tell me that I should never love a woman with a child or someone elses child. If you think of love as some kind of zero sum game, kids as competition for resources and cannot see the value in loving someone totally despite the chance that you may not be in their lives forever then you're simply not the kind of person that I'd ever take advice from and the world is worse off for your selfish ideology.  Also you're not even answering the question that I've asked. So kindly keep it to yourself if that's all you have to say.  Edit 2: Seriously the only people I want to hear from are men who have been through something like this and have advice to give. I don't care about what you think about women with children. Thank you to everyone that is helping me with their answers from experience, it means alot. Edit 3: I just woke up and I just want to express the amount of gratitude that I have for all the loving and understanding answers that people have given me both here and in my DM's. It's overwhelming really and it really is helping me process this and giving me solace and perspective. Thank you. I can't answer you all but I am reading and rereading to you all and I will continue into the future whenever I need a little help. What it has helped me understand is I shouldn't just be sad that it's over but also happy that it happened, and also proud of myself for having made a position impact on the kids life. I do hope one day we can reconnect in some way but if it doesn't then at least I can find warmth in the knowledge that I gave him what he needed whilst I could and that I may have left a positive mark on his upbringing. Most of all I really do hope that he grows up to be a happy person. And for anyone who doesn't see the value in those things or has reached out just to make fun, who don't see love as the ultimate and most important and complete thing that we can do in life, but as simply a means to get what they want that should be jealousy guarded even to the detriment of a child's wellbeing; I really do just feel bad for you and I wish that you had better parental figures in your own lives.","It's about the love you gave and the lessons you taught.

g8asyd,"I was about 14. It was winter in England and as usual, it was raining. Something we’re all used to.    I had to go out into the garden to put a few things away in the shed and it was already pitch black outside. We had a fairly big garden. The shed was on the far side and we had a little path down the side of the house with a gate that led to the driveway. It was really windy and the gage and shed door were both flapping in the wind and making loads of noise. Street lights were positioned so there was just enough light in the garden to let you kinda see, but not enough for you really identify something. I always found it kinda creeps.    So I throw a few things in the shed and lock it up. As I start walking back inside, that’s when it happens.    The gate to the drive way swings open with a gust of wind and crashes around it’s hinges. Then something comes sprinting down the path towards me.    It was about the size of Labrador.

I let out the manliest scream I could, ran towards it and with all my might I kicked it like my life depended on it.     Our recycling box was never the same. My foot went straight through it.

You'd think it would go without saying that the best way to make your sooper special boyfriend who you loooove so fucking much feel special and loved and appreciated ISN'T by asking millions of dudes WHO AREN'T HIM how to fucking treat him.  If you're STILL just ten working fingers and an empty, echoing glass jar where your brain should be when it comes to ideas, then go to fucking /r/gifts or /r/dating_advice. Or you know, you could just ask him.  I hate you. Now, go away.","To all the empty glass jars who think Hatch did this without consulting us, the rest of us could not be happier with this.

gs7eku,So i used to not be able to feel much during sex. Which was good and bad. Good because i could fuck for hours. Bad because i literally had to focus on something really specific to cum. Nowadays my penis is extra sensitive and honestly i liked it better the way before.  How do you reduce sensitivity?,"So, to actually answer the question seriously. If you aren't circumcised, you can run water over your exposed glans while showering, every day. If you are able to roll up the foreskin and keep it that way while wearing underwear, you can also try that. If you are circumcised, wear boxers or go commando. Basically anything that causes your penis to jiggle around and the glans to rub against the fabric as you walk, as opposed to boxer briefs that just pack everything tight and safely in cotton. None of these will physically change your glans, but rather they adjust your brain's baseline to stimulus. Kind of like how you stop hearing your fridge after some time in the kitchen.",9793

gyuzot,"Edit: Thanks everyone, I've read all your answers and there have been some really helpful bits of advice. I appreciate it. Will probably delete this post soon so don't keep getting notifications about it but thanks for your help. &#x200B; I (M35) have just found out that my father has been accused of raping a child that I know. He will go on trial later this year. He has always been an excellent father to me, I love him and I can't believe he would do this, but I also can't believe that the child would lie about this since going to court will be massively traumatic for them too. I don't live near them (and Coronavirus has shut down travel in my country) so from a distance I'm trying to support my mother, who is so distraught I'm worried she will have a heart attack or something. I'm also trying to support my father, because if he is innocent then I cannot fathom how gruelling this is for him. And if he's guilty then our justice system and everyone else on the planet will take care of punishing him. But I feel like I'm going a bit batshit myself, because I simply have no idea if I should feel sorry for him or be disgusted by him, and I flipflop between feeling incredibly sad and feeling burning rage. It's extra cutting because I would like to have a child myself, but I'm gay and my long-term partner isn't interested in kids, so I was already feeling down about that but was on the way to accepting it. Now I feel like my whole family is destroyed. I send my mother messages daily and she says they keep her going, but some days I just feel so sick about the whole thing that I want to cut myself away from it completely - like when someone dumps you and you cut all ties and block them so that you can get over them and move on. How can I support my parents through this ordeal without it destroying my own mental health?","I have been in a situation where one of my ex-girlfriend's family members turned out to have committed sex crimes against children and grown women (and was guilty). He had also been a good father to her. My observation was that this entire thing is going to pass through multiple ""stages"". Your mother's relationship with your father will be tested, as will yours, and you will probably experience alternating periods of being aligned and badly misaligned with various factions of people involved, as well as periods of peace and turmoil within yourself.  Stoic philosophy has much to say on this issue. You are in the type of situation where ""thinking ahead"" is impossible, for the future is riddled with moral questions and complex legal processes that will do nothing but create anxiety in yourself should you put your mind there. In stoicism, one looks only to the present moment and present problems, focusing your mind on the tasks that currently fall within your control and not casting your mind further. Practically speaking, this means choosing your next action and your next thought, but little more. Keeping your mind on the immediate, practical and controllable will minimise your anxiety and permit you to be a rock in a time when everything you've come to know as stable is changing.",8666
h0jtnd,"I'm baffled by the number of times guys have told me they don't have a condom with them. Are you not expecting to have sex? Are you expecting to have unprotected sex? Common sense says if I don't know your last name, you're not fucking me bareback. I always have condoms in my purse (in a metal case so they don't get messed up). But every guy has their favorite brand, so it's not always the ones they are used to. I went into a sex shop the other day and asked if they sold assorted size condom packs and the dude looked at me with a look of total confusion and said no girl had ever come in looking for that.

I have learned a lot about other people's perspective on this topic.  1) I'd like to say that just because I enjoy casual sex, that does not mean I have no standards and will have sex with anyone. And it certainly does not mean that I want unsolicited NSFW photos in my inbox.  2) I was previously under the assumption that most people who engaged in casual sex used condoms for STI protection. I now know that this is not a valid assumption and I will be more proactive in discussing this with partners.  3) I realized I can be more direct in the way I communicate prior to meeting someone and during the encounter.  4) I never thought about the fact that guys don't have a purse with a bunch of random ""just in case items"". So carrying a condom is a conscious choice before going out.  5) I confirmed that some guys are assholes and will try to manipulate me into having unprotected sex even when I explicitly stated this is not okay with me",just ask for his last name then sheesh,5427

hbk6iz,"I (24f) recently started seeing a new guy who waited until we were in bed about to get it on to tell me that he doesn’t wear condoms “on principle.” He said that he’s used them before for one night stands but not people he “talks to” because it doesn’t feel as intimate or close. I told him that down the line if we got tested and were committed it would be different, but this would’ve been our first time so I was not gonna let that fly (personal/sexual health is not something I am willing to compromise). It led to an argument which ended with him saying girls have never had issues with it before and leaving. I, slightly hurt and feeling rejected, just took this as a load of f*** boy bs and kicked him to the curb. I talked to other women and found out that it’s not an uncommon phenomenon.

hvy89e,"So I (M23) recently started going to therapy for the first time in my life, mainly for severe depression but also for bulimia/body issues. My therapist recommend I join a group session, which I did, and out of the nine people there I am the ONLY guy. That in itself is kind of upsetting because, in my experience, eating disorders was always kind of presented as a female thing. I felt even more alone for having a ""female problem"" and going to that group only seemed to confirm it. Now I know that isn't actually true and there are plenty of males with similar problems, but still. You can't deny that not only does the problem SEEM more prevalent in women, but it also SEEMS far more accepted and supported with women than it does with men. To make matters worse, I have a tendency to tear up when talking about something that makes me really uncomfortable. Not like cry, but glassy eyed with an occasional tear I guess. Most times I don't even feel upset, it feels like an involuntary self defense thing more than anything else. For some that may seem like a totally normal thing, but growing up in a household where you were constantly told that it makes you appear weak really changes your perception on stuff like that lol. So my session consisted of me, a 23 year old man, in a room surrounded by women talking about a very uncomfortable part of my life that the public perceives as a more ""feminine"" issue, and then tearing up as I'm talking. I had never felt that small and exposed in my entire life. Of course everyone was very supportive but it still felt very very wrong, like I should be ashamed.  I'd love to hear similar stories if you guys have any","Went to rehab as a teenager and had way too many issues going on. I basically finally admitted out loud to a group of middle aged men about my childhood sexual abuse and I broke down crying so hard that we had to break group for a few minutes. The guys came by one by one and told me how brave I was for talking about it. Two of them had similar issues which helped lead to their drug addiction in the first place. It was a terrible time for me but if I can give you any comfort or advice is this: This moment that makes you feel small right now, may also be the moment that you look back on and think, “that’s when I finally started to get better”. It takes a lot to put yourself in such a vulnerable position like that so be proud of yourself for taking that step. I hope nothing but the best in your recovery and don’t worry about whether or not your issue is feminine or not, it’s your issue and it’s valid. Take care and know that so many people care about you. &#x200B; Update/Edit: I just want to say thank you so much to everyone who has reached out to me  . I think that the responses here speak more than my original comment. It's so important to reach out and talk about our issues and to allow ourselves to be vulnerable.

I was changing in the locker room right after our gym class, all of a sudden a guy, very athletically built one at that, exclaims, ""damn, [my name] is getting pretty wide"". Of course people took notice and stared at me approvingly. It's moments like that, which made me fall in love with training. Now it's your turn to share! Edit: read through every single comment now, and this reminded me of another story. In June we went on a camping trip with our class and since it was pretty sunny day I decided to wear a tank top (first time in my life).  My Crush said that my arms were looking huge and asked how many pull ups I could do (11, for those interested) That was of course incredible, but an even better event was when the most jacked guy I knew told me that I was ""a closet"" (common saying in my country's language). Might have helped that I went right after my workout and still had a pump on. Edit 2: since people keep asking, the expression is ""Kaste"" and is german Edit 3: to further specify, I'm from Switzerland","Started a new job and a co-worker asked if I went to the gym. I said yes and she then asked if I trained my legs. I said yes again and asked why. ""Your legs look really good, I can tell"" Been riding on that high almost a year later EDIT: Pretty sure she wasn't flirting, horn-dogs. She was a lesbian",5805

ibutvq,I am 23 year old. I feel like I have to achieve something before I turn 30. I don't know if this is just specific to me or a common problem for people of my age. Feeling a little overwhelmed by this imaginary deadline that I have set for myself.  How do you deal with it?,"My advice as a 38 year old man from NZ? Try to stop worrying about achieving something by x date and start simply trying to find your version of happiness.  I’m not going full blown hippie on ya. I believe we are conditioned to constantly feel like we should be productive, constantly compare ourselves to others and that “success” is things/money based. Throw that mindset away - it’s nonsense! The search for your individual happiness means there is no else you can compare to. Your happiness is yours alone. It can be as small as 30 mins of exercise or a favourite snack. Can be as large as starting a savings account slowly ticking over or being brave and vulnerable in a relationship. Daily, weekly, monthly - you can take small, medium and large action. Your happiness can change and evolve. Evolve with it. Don’t see your job or salary as something that defines your worth. See them as a means to helping you achieve happiness in certain aspects of your life. If your job hurts then start thinking about doing something else. We spend our lives in mental prisons thinking we aren’t good enough and that time is running out. We are! You are! You have the most time available to you now. Spend it on you - Fuck the noise and find your happiness. It may sound easier said than done but nothing worth while is easy. Some of your happiness will require work, sacrifice and reflection. Start small and go from there. You got this! The secret of life in my opinion is not accruing a list of achievements but living your life as much as possible on your own terms and being kind to others. Update: My second award ever! Thank you very much! Update 2: I’m truly overwhelmed and humbled by the response my words have had. I just want to say thank you for all the insight and chats started. All the honesty and desire to make ourselves happier, content and the sharing of mistakes along the way. All the awards are astounding - thank you. I’m just glad my words resonated! Thank you and best of luck for your search for what makes you happy. I hope you all find it. I hope you all live peaceful lives. You deserve nothing less",5923
id07mx,"I'm a 21 year old and recently i got a surgery which has a lengthy recovery, i told all my friends about it coming up to the operation or atleast slipped it into conversation. It happened 5 weeks ago now, only one person has texted to ask me since the operation how it went and how I'm getting on. Ive kind of just realised that I'm an adult male now and people don't really care about you anymore. What age did you discover that you're on your own or has anyone else experienced similar?","Yeah. I think most guys, by their early 20s, go through some sort of major life problem that makes them realize most of the people who are their friends and coworkers are only there when you're laughing and making jokes together. When the shit goes down, you've got a very small squad of people -- mostly family for most people -- who actually give enough of a shit to reach out or worry about you.  One thing, though: some dudes your age can be super uncomfortable about hospitals or sickness. They might still care, but are waiting for you to reach out before they say anything. Other guys (like me) come from places where men are taught to be stoic, so they're 100% willing to help if you ask, but they aren't going to insult you by being solicitous.  (Or they're just dicks. 50/50 I'd say.)",4436
idcl1m,"I've been reading posts about it and I'm starting to think I've been a porn addict since my early teens. I know a lot of other guys too who I'm sure are addicted.  I remember before I started heavily abusing it and myself I had 0 expectations and such a strong sex drive. I'd be fully erect just sitting beside a girl in my teens and now I'm 30 and have trouble maintaining an erection while I'm inside someone. I would hang out with girls just for their company and now its just to try and have sex just for the sake of having sex. Porn has made me so toxic in relationships, I just want to go back to the guy who enjoys the company of others rather than a guy trying to bang the hottest freak he can. I met a girl and been so busy trying to impress her, I haven't really had time to watch porn and obsess about sex. I think I'm going to give it up completely.",There is very little research on porn addiction and many people argue it doesn't exist. Also I believe porn addiction is so widespread that it is normalized. If most men are compulsively masturbating to porn daily then that becomes the baseline and people trick themselves into thinking it is normal. You will see quite a few of these guys in the comments I am sure.,7021
ifkhr2,"Like for example walking almost three miles across the city at an ungodly hour just to meet up with her or something. Just an example, definitely not anecdotal.","Meet her at a party in her hometown which was located 2,5 hours drive away from where I lived. At that time:  - I didn't have a car so I convinced a coworker to go  (and drive us in his car).  - I was a smoker. From the time I called the girl that day to ask her out (around 2pm) I stopped smoking because she didn't like cigarettes.  - my coworker was also a smoker. I asked him not to smoke inside his car so I wouldn't smell like cigarettes. He wasn't happy with this request but did what I asked. My coworker and I finally made to the party to find that the organisers only accepted cash. We didn't have enough cash for the tickets. The girl didn't bother coming outside to help us out. So it's around 10pm and we're trying to find an atm to get more cash. Please note: we were in a small town in a third world country.  We asked around and learnt there were two atms around the area:  1) inside a petrol station 2) inside a shopping centre We drove to the petrol station and the ATM was not working. We drove the shopping centre which is supposed to close at 10pm. We get there at 10:15ish and we see some people leaving the place. we tried to go inside to use the ATM but the security guard doesn't allow us inside because it's past 10pm. 20 minutes later I managed to convince him to speak to his manager (who's at his place enjoying his Saturday night). His manager answers the phone and after cursing and wishing my family the most horrible things you can ever imagine he does authorise us in. The security guard escorts us to the ATM. We get the cash... Victory! We go back to party and we're finally able to get in. I called the girl a few times and she doesn't pick up my calls. Few moments later I managed to find her...

The latter is very good, of course, but I guess it comes more natural to you when you are crazy about small ones regardless of whom they're attached to.    In any case, you should show them a lot of love while you're having sex. But also outside of the bedroom. Praise her figure, tell her how good her body looks in certain clothes, suggest she wears certain dresses or shirts because you love how her boobs look in them, cop a feel or fondle them on unexpected moments (when you're alone together, obviously) and say you just couldn't help it because they're so hot.

He looks me in the eye as he's walking towards me then slightly goes to my side and keeps walking as my arm is outstretched for a handshake and I'm halfway through introducing myself.  I was standing there pretty baffled about how rude he could be but then chalked it up to not realizing so after he goes into the office and comes back out I assume he has found his bearings so fast forward a minute or two and we both find ourselves at the coffee station and I go back in.. outstretched my arm and go ""hey mate I'm co-"" and he cuts me off. ""The milks empty can you get me another.""  Just talks at me, time to give the boys their prestart before we get out there.

We closed the counter at 8 and cleaned until 9. My dept manager said if we finished cleaning early we could head out. But he was 9-5 so he wasn’t around. I worked there for some years, and as the years went on one of the front end managers that did closing didn’t like us leaving early. It wasn’t up to them. They were not my boss. At some point they implemented a policy where we had to call the front desk and they had to come verify cleaning was done and sign off on it. The manager that didn’t like us leaving early would say he was coming when we called, but then he just wouldn’t come til 9 to verify so that he could keep us there the whole time. So my solution was, after I finished cleaning I would just walk to the front desk and find him, and tell him I was ready. He would say “OK, be right there.” And I would say “OK, I’ll wait.” And I would just stand right next to him until he went to check. He hated that.",6608

kft17i,I am a 30 something breast cancer survivor. I am unable to have penetrative sex (can tolerate 1 inch insertion with some pain and bleeding) at the moment as my breast cancer treatment has put me through quick and harsh temporary menopause. I have been seeking treatment for this side effect from my oncologist and am actively working on solving this issue. I currently had a long distance boyfriend (due to my need to continue chemo close to home and not move provinces) so it has not been a big issue. I am feeling pretty insecure because I don't know how long these side effects might last. I will have to go one hormonal treatment that causes similar side effects. Would this be a deal breaker for most men? I want to please my partner and also want to be sexually active in this way. EDIT: Thank you all for your input! I never imagined that I would get so many responses. Thank you especially for sharing your personal experiences with similar issues. I cannot respond to all of you but will get to those you sent me a private message.  I want to clarify that my guy is in no way demanding or pressuring me into sex. He is very gentle with me. He is also very capable of pleasing me in other ways. This question stems more from me feeling guilt and self-conscious about my situation.  Please understand that the changes a person undergoes while having and being treated for cancer are immense. I also want to reassure you that I have every reason to believe that I will beat this (my last scan at the end of October showed no evidence of cancer). I am currently on a  chemo that does not cause systematic side effects like those portrayed on TV. My chemo is designed to target only cancerous cells - very interesting stuff. It's call Kadcyla for those of you who are interested. I am on this to reduce my chances of reoccurrence.  ,"My wife once had a case of what turned out to be recurring BV, and for a 2 year period we were infrequently able to have penetrative sex. The longest consecutive period we couldn't have sex was 6 months, and that period started 1 month after our wedding.  It was very hard, because we both wanted it, but it was excruciatingly painful for her. There were a few times where she tried to soldier through it, but I stopped because it was clear she was in pain and not enjoying it.  It took time and effort on both our parts, but we were able to find other ways to be intimate. Penetrative sex is not the be all, end all of intimacy, and if you love eachother, then you'll be able to find other ways to express your love for eachother.  If your man loves you and cares about you, he'll work with you, and understand your limits. Just be open and honest about it so that he understands the situation. Edit: A lot of people have asked how my wife resolved her BV. Here is a copy of a DM I sent to someone on the subject explaining it.   She went to a gynecologist that didn't really take her seriously for a while, which was surprising because this doctor was also woman. She did go through mutlitple rounds of various medications with this doctor, but it always came back after a little while. Then she found a different gynecologist who really took it seriously.  That doctor recommended all the usual stuff, cotton underwear, probiotics, etc. But she also recommended that my wife stop using vagisil and start washing intimate areas with regular warm water. It cleared up shortly after that and hasn't returned. Apparently after some time of using it, your body can develop a kind of aversion to vagisil and it can cause recurring BV infections. I don't know the medicine, I'm not a doctor, but that's kind of the gist of what the doctor said.  My wife and I have had many conversations about how absurd it is that a company can sell a product marketed as clean and healthy that actually ends up causing infections.  If you're using vagisil or any other special soaps, consider stopping using them, even if they're marketed as ""pH balance"".  (There's also a few other methods listed in the comments below, but that's what worked for my wife.)",5346

Now, he almost expects attractive women to want to date with him and gets extremely upset when they turn him down. Extremely upset as in ""going to the basement and punching a pillow for God knows how long"". He no longer wants to have female friends (another change) unless they dating, saying ""why do I have to keep up with a bitchy woman if I'm not fucking her?"". Also if we're out and he sees a cute girl walking alone, he's like I'll go ask her out, which I've stopped him from doing because it's a bit much to get asked out when you're shopping for groceries. He follows people on tiktok and Facebook who have been getting arrested for radical views and he's been reflecting that as well. How do I snap him out of this? EDIT: I'm talking to a mutual friend that's attending the same PhD program and she said there's a girl in class that keeps hyping up his toxic masculinity and she tells him he's the most masculine man she's met. The only time he's told me about her is when he said there's a girl in class that's not worth asking out bc ""she's too fat"" . I think that accounts for the sudden change in behavior over the last 2 months. Update: I hung out with him before he travels back to the city he studies at. Brought up a lot of points mentioned here: I asked about steroids and he denied it like his life depended on it, and said it's a compliment I said he's on steroids. I mentioned his mindset and how it won't get him into a healthy relationship, and he said dudes that are jacked get away with anything, which I said no and that was a whole argument. I brought up how saying you're alpha doesn't really mean anything and labeling people in happy relationships as betas is kinda fucked up, he said his dad was alpha and got a lot of women to sleep with him and his dad calls him alpha whenever they talk on the phone (so he's viewing it as a positive thing since his role model, his dad, is calling him that). His dad hates his sister's husband and calls him beta, seems like my buddy learned a few things from his old man. I brought up the girl he talks to in class that calls him masculine, and he said ya she's cool but she won't be anything more than a friend unless she loses at least 20 pounds. Also, he said he stopped watching porn/stopped jacking off so he feels incredibly tense all the time. He said that's something he's noticed and how his personality has been changing since he stopped jacking off. Lastly, I asked about all the ""hot girls he asked out"" and 3 of them have agreed to meet with him for coffee (together, so 4 people hanging out) once he flies back to the city his PhD program is @.

Voices were never raised, the conversation could not have been misconstrued. I was genuinely confused. She could not explain why she thought I was mad, but she could ""just tell"". Again I assured her I wasn't. She accused me of lying about how I felt and stormed out...  Maybe she was projecting a bit, but I don't know what she could have been mad about. I let it go. The next day I called her up, she was evasive, said we shouldn't see each other anymore. I didn't understand why, but I respected her decision. Ran into her 6 months later, she asked me out again. I was confused and hesitant. I figured she probably dumped me for some other dude and it didn't work out, so I wanted an explanation first. Nope, she dumped her 1(900) #  psychic advisor after she received bad relationship and career advice. She dumped me, quit her job, dyed her hair, and a litany of other more egregious life changes I won't discuss here (some of which were dangerous).  She ended our relationship because a telemarketing psychic scammer dispensed fortune-cookie caliber advice while charging her by the minute. I politely declined to see her again.",8372

l2jvvz,"FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS ASKED OUT BY A GIRL. I was with a few guy friends buying snacks and this girl just came and out of 5 boys, she initiated the conversation with me and I thought she was just being friendly but then she asked my number and I was like, ""OH. SORRY OH BUT OH I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND OH"" It was so awkward and I don't think she will ever ask a guy out. What should I have done? Edit: Oh god this blew up  I took your responses and if ever I get asked out again by a girl, I will use those.

l31dum,"Edit: for all of the raging feminists, the title should've been ""sex doesn't make me happy"", not ""women don't make me happy"". I (25m) spent years hooking up and have had dozens of partners. What I previously thought would manifest into an insatiable hole of sexual conquest has actually turned into the opposite. I have grown to realize that sex is such a small fraction of my happiness. I used to seek out arm candy and now I don't even bother. What I realized matters is in the heart... beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It's mostly on the inside of us, in our brains and hearts. Pussy has grown to possess no value to me whatsoever. I actually enjoy friendships with women in my life. I'm thankful for the heartaches and the romances that have passed. Trying to objectify women for years has actually done the complete opposite- the more I met and slept with women, the more I realized that it doesn't matter. Sex is as desirable as eating, sleeping, or shitting. It's great for a few moments and then it ends. It's the life you live before and after that matters. There are many more satisfying things in life, filled with much more substance. So now I am 25 and see that I am a man I would never thought I'd be. Still kinda horny, but with a different perspective. And I'm wondering if anybody can relate. Edit: thank you for the awards. Lots of great replies and some judgemental ones too. Thank you all for coming together in a civil way to discuss something that I think a lot of men think about! God bless you all.","What I learned was that you can't expect someone else to fill a hole in you.  It's not fair to them, that instead of being themselves, they have to fill up something missing in you. What works is when someone *adds* to your life, and you add to theirs.  If you're not happy, and you need them to fill that hole, then you're *taking away* from them, not adding to them.  And you should never want to make your partner less than they are. My wife *increases* my happiness, but I don't depend on her for all of it.  Nobody can carry that burden for someone else.",4363

l844gk,"This is a very stupid post but I thought some other perspectives might help calm my anxiety. I’m (22F) having a guy over for the first time. I’ve never done anything before, don’t even know how to kiss, and he is fully aware of this. We’re probably just going to watch a movie and cuddle, maybe make out depending on how the night goes. Is there anything that I should do to prepare for him? Obviously I’ve taken a shower and covered all of the hygiene stuff. I have fresh sheets and blankets, cleaned the kitchen and bathroom, and got a few snack things for tonight. Is there anything else I should get done? Update: holy hell you guys! I never intended for this to go as crazy as it did. He should be here within an hour and will update tomorrow for those of you who are interested. Thank you for all of your comments, ideas, and positive thoughts! Second update: I’m not sure how/where to post this so that everyone who was invested in my night can find it. Things went... ok. The spark just wasn’t there. I don’t know if it was because of my nervousness or just genuinely not a connection. Things also moved a lot quicker than I had anticipated. I specifically stated that I wanted to go slow, take small steps, literally just hang out and watch a movie and whatever happens, happens. Pretty soon I feel his hand under my shirt playing with my boobs. Whatever, don’t really care. Not even 5 seconds goes by before he’s on top of me asking if he can kiss me. I told him yes and his tongue *immediately* is down my throat. I tried to pull back a little but ultimately ended up in a slobbery mess. Sorry to disappoint the crazy number of you who commented and liked this post, just wasn’t the right guy. Third update: good morning! I’m literally in tears at the amount of love, support, and concern so many of you have shown me. I had no idea my post would ever go this direction. I’m just adding this in for any clarification and for those who are now finding this.  1) I’ve known this guy for almost a year. He’s (26) a mutual friend of mine and we recently started talking more seriously about a month ago.  2) Since the first time he asked if he could come over (about 2 weeks ago), I have made it clear that I need to take things slow. I struggle with severe anxiety due to an abusive father. He knows this. He’s listed to me talk about things that I can’t do because of him. I thought I had made myself clear but I’m second guessing that now.  3) Any remaining advice for how to do things differently in the future would be greatly appreciated! Much love- S 4th update: well damn everyone. Front page and all, I’m honored haha. Never thought my first date would get me Reddit famous. For the few of you still invested, messaging me, or finding this post later on, I have a final ending for everyone. He messaged me earlier this afternoon just asking general convo questions. We finally got to talking about last night and I told him that I felt incredibly uncomfortable and things went too fast. He got pissed and told me I should’ve been “honored” that he even wanted to do anything with me. Told me that no one likes a prude and we should’ve just gone all the way to get it over with. Took a few screenshots and he’s now blocked. Thanks for everything, stick around if I ever get to dating someone ever again.",You have the bases covered. You're good.,7072

Keep the snackage to a minimum, don't drink your calories all the time, eat some vegetables (particularly green ones), and if you need to eat out a lot don't opt for burgers and fries all the time.

You kinda restored my faith in men a little. Edit #2: WOW. I didn’t expect this to get so many responses. But I promise I’m trying to read every single one of them no matter how fast they come in. Thank you to all the men who’ve responded. Edit #3: Getting a lot of questions through messages/chats. Figured I’d answer them once instead of over and over again. • this was 5 years ago and they are no longer my friends  • I have a much more supportive group of friends now • I did give a statement but I didn’t press charges and I didn’t get rape kit (which I highly regret) • it has recently been revealed that the guy who raped me raped multiple other women. I will be helping with the investigation.  Hopefully that’s all the questions.,"This happened to me in high school. A girl I had a crush on called me from a party and was like “Can you come pick me up?” She sounded weird, so I did. I picked her and a friend up at the party and she was on the verge of tears. I asked if she was alright and she said “something happened” and then she told me enough where I could more or less infer what happened. I asked her if she wanted to go to the hospital or the police station, but she just asked me to drive her home. I just put on some relaxing music and told her I was there if she needed to talk. Then I dropped her off. Years later during the MeToo movement she brought it up on social media, she didn’t remember that I drove her home, but I’m still glad I did.",7137
n3s14f,"Examples include ""men writing women"" type stuff. *she could feel her period coming on at an inconvenient time, so she just held it in until she got home.* Stuff like that cracks me up. Edit: Heres mine. I thought that girls had to wash their vaginas with fragranced soap. Like squirt it up in there and then rinse as best as you could. I later learned (the hard way) this is a #1 no,no and will lead to certain pain, itchiness and yeast infections.","i was only 9 at that time, my friend told me that people shit in different colours, that girls shit in colours such pink, yellow and all, he also claimed that he got the blue colour, i was just so devastated that i got the disgusting brown colour.",6892
n4rylc,"For me it was when I took a good look in the mirror and was like, “hey, I beat myself up too much. I’m a decent looking guy.” After that my confidence boosted and women took more of an interest in me. What made you guys realize this? Edit: also because working out has made me appreciate myself more and a girl I was talking to told me I was cute and asked if we could send. That was a huge boost in my confidence. We were gonna hookup but she had a bf so I cut off all ties with her and I was an emotional wreck for a day or two because of how bad I felt. Edit 2: this was not the first occasion I have been called cute, it was just the one that stuck with me the most Edit 3: someone sent me a link and it turns out some people put my post on an incel website or something and it’s kinda fucking hilarious what they are saying about me. My favorite is that I look like Dwight schrute lol. I used to be an incel until I realized, “wait, women and society are not the problem, I am” and then I bettered myself. I am so proud how I went from being an incel to being hated by incels hahaha","When college started and everyone was getting to know each other, people started calling anyone with a common name by some adjective-their name title. There was ""drummer Eric"", ""ginger Alex"", that kind of thing. One of my friends told me they had heard a group of girls refer to me as ""hot (myname)"" and my confidence has been forever boosted.",6752
n839nm,I’ll start. My best friend was beat up over this girl and he always looked at her picture that he had in his wallet. One days while he was looking at it and I asked him to let me see. I proceeded to put it in my mouth and chew on the picture while making direct eye contact the entire time. I spit it out and asked him if he wanted it back. He got this stupid grin on his face and said “nah I’m good” lol Edit: I’m going to try my best to read all your stories! I didn’t expect it to blow up like this! All of you are awesome. Except that one guy who commented about cooking semen. Fuck you in particular lol,My best friend is the type of person who if you asked him to come pick you up because your car broke down 100 miles away and it’s 3 in the morning he would come get you no questions asked.  I gave him his 20% for a down payment for a home. He was struggling with work at the time and got his girlfriend pregnant. He wanted to raise the kid with her but he was living at home. I am not well off by any means but had enough in the bank to give him something to help out. He is very practical and only was looking for a beginner home and eventually move into something better down the road. I never once asked him to pay me back but he promised he would. I told him to take his time and make sure to be a good dad. I never charged him interest or anything of that sort. We still hang out and grab drinks and stuff and one day 7 years later he hands me a check for the amount I gave him. He was bawling when he handed it to me. That’s what good friends do for each other. Support one another and love them like they are family. Edit: Folks 20% back then is not what 20% is now. This happened way before the 2008 real estate bubble and collapse.,10398
n8gsd2,"My parents didn't raise me the right way regarding jobs: For them, if it's something you don't like, toss it.

PS1: wow, this thread did really explode! 500 comments in 6 hours! PS2: thanks for the gold kind strangers!",There's a realistic in-between: a job that you enjoy for much of the time that's not always perfect.

Narrator voice:  ""If only that had been true.""","When I was at high school, 14 years old, I decided to ask Louise, a girl from my class, out on a date.  Unfortunately, I decided to do this at lunchtime, and right after I had finished a bag of Cheese and Onion flavoured crisps. I sat next to her and started to talk to her, but before I even got to ask the question, she caught wind of my breath and said - and these words are tattooed on my soul - ""oh fuck off, you stink."" It's been 32 years, and I still blame the crisps.",11028
ndmycv,"Mine was when I was around 14 and my grandfather was dying. My grandfather refused and fought death until my dad told him he will care for his wife, my dad’s mother in law, and he will follow her where she went. My grandfather within ten minutes upon hearing that, died with a calm face. My grandfather feared that no one would take care of her not even their own children until my dad promised him he would. I developed a new respect for my father and help him with my grandmother as much as I can 12 years later. Love you Father. Edit: I did not expect this post to grow and become this hot.

Men should support one another.","When my son was 16 months old, the ex-wife burned his chest with an iron. I was deployed and came home to a filthy kid that screamed when I picked him up. The Dr. figured that the burn, 2nd and 3rd degree, was about 4 days old. The base had a small medical unit with just a Dr. and a nurse. They couldn't keep my son's arms down while scrubbing the wound so for 21 days I held my son's arms down and listened to him scream as they scrubbed. That was 35 years ago and I *STILL* have trouble talking about it. No, I never got married again. Edit: Thank you for the awards and the kind comments. Edit 2: Wow this blew up. I did not expect that. So many awards. Thank you all.",5096

ngaeew,Haven’t lived at home since college but I’ve always lived with roommates. my lease is up at the end of this  month and I’m finally taking the plunge of living alone in two weeks. Not sure how I’ll like it but it’s happening either way.  Did not expect to get so many answers! I can’t keep up and respond to everyone but I truly appreciate all the tips!  So many people have mentioned a bathroom trash can. I’ve always had one and never thought anything of it. The concept of men not having one is wild to me.,"1. Its going to be quiet very often. If you're not okay with that consider buying a Bluetooth speaker or some sort of white noise generator.  2. Toilet paper, dish washing liquid, laundry detergent, soap, shower curtain, plunger, towels, trash bags(and a can)- all things you need to remember to buy.  3. Consider buying less food more often. I'm not sure how the food arrangement was with your old roommate but I know I threw alot of old food away when I lived alone because I kept buying too much.  4. If you start feeling lonely dont be afraid to reach out. Living alone is a totally different experience and imo will teach you alot about yourself that you didn't know before.  5. Enjoy the peacefullness.",8010

Because despite her being an absolutely wonderful person whom I love  I knew we wouldn't work out over the long run.

nk3kpp,"Got my ass crack lasered yesterday for the very first time. I figured that after the laser hair removal treatment, I'd find some guidelines and what to do/not do after laser treatment. One of them said to keep the area of treatment clean, but shitting does the exact opposite. Am I just supposed to not take a shit for an entire 24 hours and get constipated? Or do I just need to shower immediately after and risk getting the area infected? Currently just using wet wipes but I'm unsure if it's actually infected. &#x200B; Sorry if this is the wrong sub.",You should ask the people with the laser.,8992

nr9nxs,"For reference, we are both in our early 20s. My friend and I, who I've known for years, used to play video games together about every other day. A little over a month ago I asked him if he wants to play some games and he gave an excuse saying he was busy. I didn't think much of it and thought he would eventually text me when he was free. A couple of days went by and I asked him again and he gave a different excuse. However, during the following weeks, I noticed that he would play with other people almost every day. Usually we exchange memes we find but he has since stopped sending them. He hasn't talked to me in over a month and I'm beginning to think he just doesn't want me around anymore. Its been eating me up for a while now and I can't seem to get over our dying friendship. I've been starting to think his other friends are just more fun to be around than me.

nssvir,"As a gay man, I love throwing compliments at men. Straight or gay, I love boosting their confidence and letting them know how attractive they are. Again, in a non sexual way.  I was at Starbucks one time and I complimented this dudes coat and asked him where he got it from. He seemed pretty weirded out by it and his girlfriend (I think) looked up at him with a “wtf...?” Type of smirk as if I asked to suck his dick and that really annoyed me.  Is it that weird to give other men compliments? I don’t come off as too “gay” either (which I don’t think should make a difference anyways). I’m really not looking to get anything out it (with maybe an exception or two. Hey, I’m human!)  But yeah... what are your thoughts?  Also message me if you want a confidence boost ❤️ or don’t, if you don’t like that...

Or worse, having someone else (e.g. a partner) sit down in between the legs? If the penis is in between the legs, and someone else's bottoms sit on it to fit in between the legs or on top of the legs, wouldn't that be painful? What about crossing legs while seated?
