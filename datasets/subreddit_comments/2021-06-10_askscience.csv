Paintings and documentaries to the contrary, there would have been times when the landscape wasn’t crawling with every species of dinosaur and other animal that inhabited that region: some may have migrated in for a time, and many would have been clumped together in herds or packs or flocks rather than randomly distributed over the landscape. If you wound up in Late Cretaceous Montana, the vegetation would be something like a mix of the forests of southern Japan and of northern Australia, in a setting something like the bayous of the Gulf Coast. Until you saw something distinctly un-modern (like a pterosaur or dinosaur) you might not know you are in another time, but might think instead you were transported to some other corner of the world today. Oh, you would see turtles: lots and lots and lots of turtles. But when you begin to notice a giant Quetzalcoatlus over head, or the herds of ceratopsians and hadrosaurids, and so forth, finding some sort of cover would be good. Depending on your nature skills, you could probably do well for a while (as well as an individual alone might get along in the most isolated parts of the Amazon rainforest or the Serengeti). Raiding nests might be a safe way of getting protein (so long as the parents aren’t nearby: since all living archosaur groups have some parental nest monitoring, we expect pterosaurs and extinct dinosaurs did the same), as well as snaring/spearing small animals, fishing (watch out for crocodiles…), and raiding kills. By the Late Cretaceous there would have been fruit, but you’d have to experiment carefully to find ones that were good for humans. I would say that making your home in the trees would be the best bet. The giant pterosaurs of the time would be too big to do much perching on trees, and those dinosaurs that could get up into the trees would generally be small enough that you could fight them off. I think it would be unlikely that tyrannosaurs would try to eat too many tree-dwelling animals when there was ground-based food to go after. There would have been climbing mammals, but these too would hopefully not be too much problem. (Oh, but don’t let the mammals jab you with their hind limbs! It appears that spurs, possibly poisonous, were common to many Mesozoic mammal groups, and that their presence in male platypus today is simply their last remnant.)

3sm2jj,"Herman, Stephen L. Delmar's Standard Textbook of Electricity, Sixth Edition. 2014 [here's the part](http://i.imgur.com/cnNuLEk.jpg) At first glance this seems logical, but I'm pretty sure this is not how it works. Can someone explain?"," You are right to be dubious of your textbook, because the statements made are false. Not ""false but only because we are making an approximation"" or ""false but it's only an apparent effect and not real"", but ""egregiously and totally false"", to the point that it's rather embarrassing that this paragraph made it into that text. Let's take a look at each of these statements. > In a DC circuit, the impulse of electricity... Just for the record, I have never in my life heard the term ""impulse of electricity"". An impulse is momentum and the term is typically used for describing the change in momentum due to a force that acts for only a very short time (e.g., the impulse of a tennis racket on an incoming tennis ball). We do have a term ""electromotive force"" which is abbreviated ""emf"" since it's not actually a force, but an electric potential. So maybe this author has defined ""impulse of electricity"" analogously, which would make ""impulse of electricity"" an electric potential per unit time. Those units strongly suggest that the author means ""impulse of electricity"" to mean that the dV/dt (where V is the voltage across the battery) is a unit impulse function. Not only is that impossible anyway, the term is still just not used, or used so exceedingly rare for my never to have heard it in my entire academic career. **edit:** *On further examination, however, it seems the author is using ""impulse of electricity"" to refer to (what he thinks to be a correct) fact that all electrons start moving at the same time once the switch is closed. So he is probably using ""electricity"" to mean electric current or the electron speed, and the ""impulse"" refers to the (incorrect) fact that the electrons begin at 0 speed and then all instantly being moving at some non-zero speed. Again, the term ""impulse of electricity"" is not used and it is extremely difficult to figure out what he means by it precisely because his entire explanation is wrong.* > Assume for a moment that a pipe has been filled with table-tennis balls. If a ball is forced into the end of the pipe, the ball at the other end will be forced out. Each time a ball enters one end of the pipe, the ball at the other end will be forced out. Yes... but it's not instantaneous as the author wants us to infer. In fact, this very consideration is what leads to one of the most commonly asked questions on this sub (""if I push a rod longer than one light-year, doesn't the end move faster than light?"" or something similar). When you push on the first ball, you create a pressure wave which propagates through the other balls and eventually pushes the last ball out. The speed of this wave is not infinite: it is finite and equal to the speed of sound in whatever material the balls are made of. > This principle is also true for electrons in a wire. No. The tennis balls in the pipe provide only a very rough analogy. In reality, when there is no electric field in the wire, the electrons are still moving. But they move randomly, and so, on average, they are at rest. If there is an electric field, the electrons still move randomly, but with some average drift in the direction of the higher potential. (Brownian motion with non-zero drift is a closer analogy than balls in a pipe.) > There are billions of electrons in a wire. If an electron enters one end of a wire, another electron is forced out the other end. Yes... but again, not instantaneously. If the electric field is already present in the wire, the drift velocity of the electrons is, in fact, very slow, literally a snail's pace in many common applications. > Assume that a wire is long enough to be wound around the earth 10 times. If a power source and switch were connected at one end of the wire and a light at the other end, the light would turn on the moment the switch was closed. But it would take light approximately 1.3 seconds to travel around the earth 10 times. No. Absolutely not. Period. This is certainly the most egregious error in this entire paragraph. **The light does not turn on instantaneously.** When the switch is closed, the change in the electric field in the wire propagates at a *finite* speed, less than the speed of light. (This signal is analogous to the pressure wave in the tennis balls.) The actual speed of this signal is determined by many factors, including the composition of the wire and its surroundings, and in copper wires in your home is typically on the order of 50-99% the speed of light. The author of your textbook is demonstrating a very fundamental misunderstanding of physics. I would say that I am horrified, but I have seen worse. --- **Various followups to some common responses and questions** --- * The author's first statement is that the electricity *appears* to travel faster than light. The word appear does not necessarily mean ""looks as if this happens, but it doesn't"". The word can mean ""this happens because this is what we see"". Regardless, the author very clearly states in at least 3 places (""instantaneously"", ""instantly"", ""the same moment"") that the propagation of the EM wave in the wire is instantaneous. * Some have commented that according to the second figure, the light bulb is actually connected via a very short wire to the battery, and the EM wave does not have to travel all around the world to reach it. First of all, I think it's rather odd to think that that specific part of the figure is drawn to scale but not anything else (or else the bulb is as large as Earth). Secondly, and more important, the light would *still* not turn on instantaneously. ""Nearly instant"", ""so quickly as to be imperceptible to humans"", ""effectively instant"", etc. are *not the same as* ""instantly"", which is what the author claims. * The text is written for electricians in a high school or community college trade program. It is not written for physicists. The errors are rather egregious, and I do understand that the correctness of this particular paragraph is likely not relevant to most using the book. (There are applications in signal processing where the signal speed in the wire does matter though.) However, I believe that a book that purports to be an educational tool, a textbook no less, should not be incorrect in anything it claims (barring new discoveries that make statements outdated). Yes, electricians probably don't need to know the details of copper wires and electricity to the atomic level, but the claim that common electricity allows for FTL communication is outrageous. I sincerely believe that many students would doubt the veracity of that statement, just as the OP has. Would you not then be cautious in trusting anything else in the book? Regardless, there are other mistakes in the text which are very relevant to the audience. * For those asking what I have seen that is worse, well, just your standard fare of creationism biology textbooks was what I had in mind. In terms of physics, I have seen new-ish fluid dynamics texts explain airplane lift incorrectly (i.e., that streamlines split and must meet up again at the other edge). I have also seen many incorrect explanations of why light does not travel at *c* in media. But IMO those last two are not as bad as an implication of FTL communication via a long wire and a light bulb.       ",6131

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks).  > How fast do they go? Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)). > Haven't gravitational waves already been detected? The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16). In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way. > Does this mean we can control gravity? No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains.

General relativity describes gravity as a result of spacetime being warped due to matter. Gravitational waves are the ripples in spacetime that happen when you shake matter around. They are to the gravitational force what light is to the electric and magnetic forces. But because gravity is much weaker than electromagnetism, we can see light all the time (just look around!) while we need to construct enormous lasers and incredibly (absurdly) precise detectors just to have even a hope of measuring gravitational radiation. Rumors are flying that LIGO, just such a system of lasers and detectors, has found a gravitational wave signal, probably coming from two black holes orbiting and falling into each other (because that's the sort of seismic event you need to make gravitational waves large enough for us to detect). This would most likely confirm what we fully expect is there, rather than reveal something new and shocking about the Universe. Think the Higgs boson a few years ago. It would be a much bigger surprise if this radiation had turned out *not* to be there: general relativity has worked extremely well so far, and we have had indirect but extremely strong evidence for their existence since the 1970s, which won the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics. LIGO's *direct* detection would undoubtedly be Nobel-worthy, too; the only question is whether it would happen this year. This is exciting because a) it's direct, rather than indirect, confirmation that these things are there, and b) they'll open up a whole new window onto the Universe. Pretty much the entirety of astronomy is done by observing electromagnetic radiation, from visible light to X-rays, the ultraviolet, microwaves, what have you. Starting now we'd have a whole other type of radiation to use to probe the cosmos, delivering us a brand new and pristine view of some extreme events involving ultracompact objects like neutron stars and black holes. So all this will probably be announced at the press conference tomorrow, ushering in a new era of astronomy and physics. Or they could just be fucking with us.",1287

So, the main thought as to why this is, is that there's a lot of dust in the Milky Way, particularly in the central couple of degrees of Galactic latitude where nearly all of the massive young stars (and therefore massive-star supernovae) are located. There's so much dust that we wouldn't be able to spot a supernova through it. To the Galactic Center, there's about 30 magnitudes of optical extinction (which means that only 1 photon in a trillion gets through!). And that's only *halfway* through the Galaxy!

Just to compare, here's an [image of the Milky Way in optical](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0102/allsky_mellinger_big.jpg), and [here's one in near-infrared](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Milky_Way_infrared.jpg) - notice you can suddenly see through a lot of the dust to the stars behind. So unless a supernova happened to go off fairly close by, or in one of the few young, massive stars out of the Plane, we'd miss it (EDIT: by eye! As /u/mfb- points out, ~~neutrino detectors on Earth would be aware of a~~ neutrinos from a Galactic supernova leave the star hours before the shockwave and light reaches the surface of the star, and neutrino detectors would detect them - hopefully that phrasing is less confusing). Projects like ZTF and LSST might spot one in the optical, though.  The main reason this is the main idea and not certain knowledge is that we haven't verified that there are historical supernovae that have been missed because of high extinction from dust. There's a way to find out though! Because light scatters off of dust, a supernova can ""echo"" around the Galaxy and the scattered light can reach us. Pairing up such echoes from different directions with each other or a supernova remnant can give a 3D view of the explosion, and a chance to see the explosion very early on. Armin Rest at STScI has done this with supernovae in the LMC before, but the Milky Way is a much larger part of the sky and is harder to do. His group has focused on known supernovae rather than look at the whole sky for new ones, but with projects like LSST about to image large parts of the sky very frequently to great depth, this area might be about to bust wide open in 10-15 years time. Regardless of if they find light echoes for missed historical supernovae, finding echoes for known ones that happened in the past is still really freaking cool - it's like archeology with light!  EDIT2: We know for a fact that supernova have happened in the last 400 years that *weren't* seen, because we can see remnants of supernova in X-ray and radio that are only about 100 years old, like G1.9+0.3 (the youngest known supernova remnant).",2639

","As an actual expert in visual perception, allow me to give the definitive answer to this question: **We don't know.** It's not as simple as resolution (as others have pointed out, you can see the individual dots peripherally if there's no masking grid), or adaptation (which is never as fast as 'instantaneous'). It's more likely related to some kind of competitive pattern-completion process that *doesn't* match the peripheral resolution, i.e. [crowding] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowding). But that said, we just don't know the answer. *edit* Possible contributors to the mechanism of Hermann grid-type illusions like this one (some suggested in replies below): 1) powerful lateral inhibition (but White's illusion? also, what kind of lateral inhibition exactly, and where in the brain?) 2) feature mis-integration (but neural how? why are low-contrast lines integrated at cost of high-contrast spots?) 3) adaptation (but how so fast? if adaptation, why is there no oscillation or timescale like in motion-induced blindness or binocular rivalry) 4) filling-in (but how and what's so special about this type of display? how does pattern filling-in work anyways?) 5) crowding/inappropriate integration (but crowding doesn't usually cause blindness to features) others?",1203
57rs2i,Assuming the marbles are something like 10 cm in diameter and around 100 g heavy. Do they ever collide? Or is the gravitational attraction way too small? But since gravitational fields are infinite they should collide at some point even if it took them something like 1*10³³ years or something. Edit: WOW. Frontpage. Never expected so much attention. Seems like people wonder as much as I do. :D,"This can be solved using conservation of energy. The total initial energy is the gravitational potential energy: E*_i_* = -Gm^(2)/r*_0_*. The energy at time t is the sum of their relative kinetic energy and their potential energy at that point: E*_f_* = mr'(t)^(2)/4 - Gm^(2)/r(t), where r(t) = |**r***_1_*(t) - **r***_2_*(t)|, and the extra factor of 1/2 comes from the reduced mass and the fact that we're looking at the *relative* kinetic energy. Now you can set these equal to each other: mr'(t)^(2)/4 - Gm^(2)/r(t) = - Gm^(2)/r*_0_*. One factor of the mass cancels, and you can simplify to: r'(t)^(2) = 4Gm(1/r(t) - 1/r*_0_*). So: dr/dt = 2sqrt[Gm(1/r - 1/r*_0_*)]. This is now a separable differential equation which can be directly integrated for the desired result: dt = (2sqrt[Gm(1/r - 1/r*_0_*)])^(-1) dr = (2sqrt[Gm(r*_0_* - r)/(r*_0_*r)])^(-1) dr = (2sqrt(Gm))^(-1) sqrt[r*_0_*r/(r*_0_* - r)] dr. This integral can be solved analytically, and somebody worked it out [here](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/14700/the-time-that-2-masses-will-collide-due-to-newtonian-gravity). Somebody there also pointed out that you can get this result directly from [Kepler's third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion#Third_law). Using the given numbers and the equation derived in the first Stack Exchange comment, I get an answer of about [3\*10^(29) seconds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi%2F(2sqrt(2\)\)+(1+lightyear\)%5E(3%2F2\)*(gravitational+constant+*+2+*+100+gram\)%5E(-1%2F2\)).

582vaf,Whelp... I went popped out after posting this... looks like I got some reading to do thank you all for all your replies!,"Yes, we can do nuclear fusion just fine. There are numerous research experiments already doing it. Heck, there's even a small, but dedicated amateur community setting up experiments. A while ago there was some highschool kid who made the news by creating a small fusion device in his living room. The problem, however, is that maintaining a fusion reaction requires a lot of energy, because the fusion plasma has to be kept at very high temperature in order for the reaction to take place. In current experiments, the amount of energy required to maintain the reaction is considerably higher than the amount of energy produced by the reaction. But, as it turns out, the amount of energy produced by the reaction scales up more rapidly with size than the amount of energy required. So by simply making the reactor bigger, we can increase the efficiency (the so-called Q factor). But simply making the reactor bigger also makes the reaction harder to control, so scaling up the process is not a quick and easy job. Scientists and engineers are currently working on the first reactor to have a Q factor larger than 1. That is, a reactor that produces more energy than it uses. This is the ITER project currently being constructed in France.",8654
58mqdp,"Re: the statistic, I found it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_oxygen *Since the start of the Cambrian period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 35% of atmospheric volume.[10] The maximum of 35% was reached towards the end of the Carboniferous period (about 300 million years ago), a peak which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at that time.*","Others have pointed out that lightning was probably more likely to cause wildfires in a more oxygen-rich atmosphere.

5b80il,"I think I've got a decent understanding of what fire *is*, insofar as it's hot air making things look wavy while the rapid oxidation of the fuel creates heat that emits a lot of visible light due to incandescence. However, this still doesn't explain to me why there's generally a very clearly defined flame, with sharp edges to it. Why wouldn't the glow of the oxidizing fuel (let's say, wood in a campfire) just glow in all directions equally, kind of like a red-hot piece of metal? What creates the appearance of the flame itself? ","Fire works a little differently than people imagine. When you look at something like a campfire, the actual wood isn't on fire. (Well, it's 'on fire', but combustion isn't occurring much at all on the wood's surface.)  And the flames themselves are not super-heated *gases* emitting blackbody radiation. Now, the gas particles are hot, and they *are* emitting red and even yellow light, but there's so little mass that the light from the gas is barely visible at all. Instead, when you look at a fire, what you're seeing are little soot particles that are being vaporized off of the wood from the intense heat, and being carried upwards by the convection.  That glowing soot is what provides the flame with enough mass to emit enough visible light for us to see it. Now, this soot is plenty hot - well past its flash point.  So as soon as it runs into enough oxygen it will burn.  In a steady state flame, there is very little oxygen near the wood, so you have a lot more unburnt soot, so the flame is both redder (cooler) and brighter.  As you go outwards (upwards due to gravity) the soot starts encountering more oxygen. So more soot burns and the flame gets hotter.  So the flame is simultaneously more yellow - hotter, and dimmer - less soot, so less dense, so less overall light.  As you get towards the tips of the flame, that's the boundary where there is basically more than enough oxygen that pretty much all the soot burns. So the flame is technically hottest there, but there's also no soot left - just gas - so the visible flame dies away.  The heat being generated all the way up the flame, mostly towards the tip, radiates back down and continually heats the wood, freeing more soot particles and continuing the cycle. And if it's not hot enough, fewer soot particles are liberated, less oxygen is consumed, so the edges of the flame shrink, get closer to the wood, and thus heat the wood up more.  So there's a feedback system involved that will tend to keep the flames at some roughly constant height based on hot much fuel and oxygen you have available. The reason that flame has so well-defined of edges is basically because if you consider diffusion of oxygen into oxygen-free gas, it's a pretty slow process.  If I take a tank of oxygen and a tank of nitrogen of equal pressure and attach them by a hose, the two gases won't really mix all that quickly.  An open flame is going to have a bit more active gas mixing, but it's a good first-order understanding on why there's such a well-defined, narrow barrier between *'not-enough'* and *'plenty-of'* oxygen for the soot to burn and thus for the flame to dissipate. This is also why you can do cool party tricks like [re-lighting a candle from its smoke trail](https://youtu.be/C5eTn5d0cvg?t=14s)  Smoke is basically unburnt soot - unburnt fuel.  This is why you can tell a smokey fire is too cold and inefficient - lots of smoke means that the fire doesn't keep the soot hot enough for it to ignite by time it gets access to oxygen.  This is also why when you blow on a flame, the flames get smaller while the fire seems to get hotter - you're providing extra oxygen into the flames - where flames are basically the area of superheated soot suspended in gas too deprived of oxygen to burn. **TL;DR:** For a campfire, the wood is the fuel tank, the flames are the fuel line, and the tips of the flame are really the combustion chamber where most of the fuel gets burnt.  What you see as 'flame' is actually the super-heated fuel in the line, which hasn't ignited because it's oxygen deprived, but is hot enough to glow from the heat radiating from the combustion chamber (flame tips).  Once it gets far enough away that it has abundant oxygen, it all burns, heating up the fuel in the fuel line to keep it glowing, and signifying the edge of the flame, as there is no longer enough soot - enough mass - radiating blackbody emissions for you to see. ***Edit*** - This is what I get from doing things from memory.  Everything above is fine, but below in some of the responses, when talking about gas stoves I need to talk about where the blue color comes from - rather than blackbody radiation, the blue light comes specifically from chemical emission spectra as particular compounds gets Oxidized.  In a number of comments I mention Carbon Monoxide, CO, being combusted into CO2 as the culprit.  Wherever you see me say that, *please imagine instead I said ""C2, CH, and CO""* as C2 and CH combusting into CO2 *also* emit blue light, and are far more [responsible for the majority](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Spectrum_of_blue_flame.svg/479px-Spectrum_of_blue_flame.svg.png) of the blue light emissions than CO.  The general principle that a blue flame is a result of a hotter fire with excellent access to oxygen, and represents more complete combustion still holds.

Growing more trees is one of the easiest ways to capture CO2, but even if you manage to increase the Earth's biomass by 1.5%, you then have to worry about maintaining biomass at that higher level.  It's easy for a catastrophic event like a forest fire to release that carbon back into the atmosphere at a future date, so forests are a poor form of sequestration. There are proposals to store significant amounts of carbon underground through ""geological sequestration"" (dissolving CO2 into deep-underground salty brines or permanently incorporating it into carbonate rocks).  That's a better form of sequestration, but the ""capture"" part is more difficult in that scenario.",3833

620y9t,"So as many of you have probably heard, the first attempted ""head transplant"" is scheduled to occur later this year. I haven't been able to find scientific articles on the subject but it seems they plan to fully connect the nerves/veins/etc, and the spine. However to my knowledge we still haven't figured out how to repair a typical spinal injury, so how can we, even if just in theory, expect to fuse two different spines to any extent? Edit: so this blew up quite a bit. For the record, I am well aware we can't fix do a body transplant yet, I simply wanted to know how we could even attempt it when we hadn't overcome a major hurdle like that though. I am well aware the odds of success are super low, that's now what I'm asking about.  I do believe a body transplant is something we could one day achieve, just not yet. Eventually someone has to try, and that's what this is to me. This year's failure could led to next year's success","https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_transplant In real terms, we have no way of knowing if the spinal nerves will re-fuse and if signals will flow again. Present medical knowledge is that once there is a catastrophic cord injury and severance, then it is pretty much over from a neurological point of view.  The issue here is that the brain stem deals with and controls all autonomous functions of the body (heart beat, breathing, etc) - which presumably will be above the incision point. It is unknown whether the brain stem will be able to send signals down the new spinal nerves, thus there is a very real risk that the ""head"" will not be able to breathe or function without life support. Combined with that, it is unknown whether the donor body's other functions (digestion, excretion etc) can be maintained by the donor brain, especially if the spinal fusion fails.  It appears that the head donor is terminally ill and has agreed to take part in a ""last ditch"" attempt at furthering of his life. He already has a terminal neurological condition which affects his body, therefore the logic is that if his head and brain ""survive"" the operation but there is no cord fusion giving movement or any quality of life, he hasn't ""lost"" anything as his brain is still in a crippled body and will likely die in due course.  From a medical science point of view, it will be fascinating to see what happens and he should be thanked for his courage and generously in effectively donating his body for the advancement of medical science and understanding.

69r3rt,"After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism). Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it. Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal. So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them. Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism. So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't. Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow? Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity. The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet. Does that kinda summ it up?","Iron loses its *ferromagnetic* properties at 1043 K (1400 F). That's the Curie Temperature, where the heat jiggles the magnetism about harder than the exchange, anisotropy, and demagnetizing fields can keep it in place. That doesn't mean it's non-magnetic, it can still be paramagnetic. As for the earth's core, the other posters here are spot on. The core is spinning, and that spinning means charges are being spun, which looks just like an electromagnet. And although the magnetic field does need to travel through the rest of the earth, and other magnetic materials on its way to the surface, the field it produces it *huge*. Much weaker than if the core was a uniformly magnetised permanent magnet, but it is still an enormous electromagnet. As for the moon, the core isn't hot enough or large enough to convect. So, it doesn't spin. So, it doesn't produce an electromagnetic effect.",4167

6bv9tk,Edit: Thanks for popping my gold cherry kind stranger!,"Hi there. The biological processes of bone healing are the same in both horses and humans. The problem is in their weight and behavior. And it depends on the location of the fracture whether or not the horse may need to be euthanized. When humans break bones, they can take weight off by sitting down, using crutches, etc. Horses don't have this option. If they take the weight off of the leg by themselves by favoring the leg, especially if they are young, the other limb may become deformed due to the increased burden. Even if they do lie down, the act of standing back up can cause the fracture to break again. Smaller horses may heal from fractures better, and a few cases may do well with amputation, but these cases are few and far between. Even if the leg is stabilized, it takes a very long time to heal. During this long time of inflammation, the horse may develop [laminitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminitis), which causes, in a word, the hooves to fall off. This is similar to having your fingernails pulled off, and for an animal that relies on supporting all of its weight on its ""fingernails"" this is incredibly painful and debilitating.

Here is a look at [Barbaro's radiographs](http://www.two-views.com/celebrity/barbaro-leg-xray.html#sthash.uUMadT8t.dpbs) and how they attempted to stabilize his distal limb. Also, practically, many horses have jobs (racers like thoroughbreds/standardbreds, work-horses like draft horses, etc), and their lives are sometimes seen as an investment. If the owner cannot afford to keep them on pasture, if it isn't a financially viable option, they may elect to euthanize. Edit: added links and clarified",11464

6efd2k,Edit: Thank you to everyone who has responded! I would have never guessed that this post would blow up like this! ,"To understand why not, you have to understand how a battery works. It's not a tank of electrons, exactly. A battery is a chemical reaction between an anode (-), cathode (+), and an electrolyte (or some form of conduit) which facilitates the exchange of electrons. When you discharge (use) a battery, a chemical reaction is occurring, moving electrons between the two chemicals (anode and cathode). So, don't think of a battery as a vessel which just holds a pile of electricity. It's a specific transfer of energy between two chemicals. Now, in a rechargeable battery, this reaction can be reversed by applying electricity using a charger. But, again, it's not adding anything, really. It's reversing the chemical reaction which is putting the chemicals back to their original state. When charging, it takes time for the reaction to reverse and at the same time, heat is created because the electrons are moving back across the conduit they travelled across originally. Electrons moving over a conductor meet resistance which creates heat, no matter which direction. Much like the battery heating up when you use the phone, the battery will heat up while charging for the same reason. If you were to throw a bunch of current at the battery, it could easily cause a thermal issue. Nickel-cadmium (NiCd: pronounced Nye-Cad) batteries had a problem called thermal runaway where the battery, if charged too quickly, the heat generated could induce a self-feeding loop where the battery could heat to a point of ignition or explosion. But that's not an issue with Lead-Acid batteries (like sealed lead acid batteries like in your car, which use a liquid electrolyte, also known as a wet cell [thanks to u/gilescoreywasframed for the correction below]). Also prone are Lithium Ion (LiOn, like in your cell phone) or Lithium-Polymer (Li-PO) batteries (credit to u/incrediboy729 for the correction here), but these usually incorporate circuitry to prevent this situation. tl;dr - it is dangerous, and modern cell phone chargers and batteries have circuitry to prevent too fast/overcharging which could lead to heat damage or fire.",14529

6ftcdu,I came across this thought while thinking about my own personality and how different it is from others.,"SometHing I can actually answer! I am on the train at the moment so references will be sparse, but most of the information will come from funder's 2001 paper. Okay so there are many different ideas, approaches and factors to take into account so I will try and outline some of the main approaches and what they believe. There is the behaviourist approach that believes our personality emerges from our experience and interactions with our environment.this occurs through mechanisms such as classical conditioning, which is where we learn to associate co-occuring stimuli. This can be seen with pavlovs dog experiment and watsons (1925) little albert experiment. Another mechanism is operant condition proposed by B F Skinner, this claims basically we will perform tasks we are rewarded for more often, and ones we are punished for less. Another approach is the biological approach that claims that our personality is determined by chemicals, hormones and neurotransmitters in the brain. Examples of this is seratonin, which amongst other things, has been linked to happiness, and has been effectively harnessed to create effective anti-depressant medications There is also the evolutionary approach that posits that we inherit our personality through genes and natural selection. Some evidence does exist for this such as Loehlin and Nicholas (1976) which displayed behavioural concordance between twins. There is also the socio-cognitive approach which believes that personality comes from thought processing styles and social experience. Evidence from this can be seen in Banduras (1977) bobo doll experiment where he taught aggressive behaviour to children through them observing aggressive behaviour. Other theories in this area also include Baldwins (1999) relational schemas that claim that our behaviour is determined by our relation to those around us Another, but contentious approach is Psychodynamics, which is widely known as Freud's area of psychology. This approach believes that personality is formed from developmental stages in early life, and the conflict between the ID (desires), ego (implementing reality onto desires) and superego (conscience) The humanist approach also has views on personality, but provides little in the way of testable theories. This approach claims that people can only be understood through their unique experience of reality, and has therefore brought into question the validity of many cross-cultural approaches to testing personality. Studies such as hofstede (1976, 2011) have attempted to examine the effects of culture in personality, and have found significant effects, but an important thing to note is that whilst means differ, all types of personality can be found everywhere. When we talk about measures of personality we often measure it with the big five measure (goldberg et al., 1980: Digman, 1989). This measure includes openness to  new experience, conscientious, agreeableness, neuroticism, and extraversion. There is more to say but I cannot be too extensive currently, hope this helps.

6gbjny,And what would happen if that AI is unrealistically and absolutely perfect so that it never loses? Is that possible?,"Given an actual AI, it would depend on the AI. Some might -play better as black than as white, or vice-versa, just like humans. But White has a first-move advantage, so it is likely that it would have an edge. If the AI was perfect is a very different question - and it is a very well discussed issue - the answer is unclear; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solving_chess This is because there are 10^43 possible board positions, and you would need to list the best response for each one in order to solve the game fully. That's unlikely to be feasible. **Edit**: The discussion about white having an advantage in perfect play is conceptually wrong - it is true in games involving current heuristic and human game playing, but irrelevant. We cannot know which player can force a win, or if there is a forced draw, without solving chess. No, the fact that heuristic methods involving pruning trees are effective at winning doesn't change the issue with needing enumeration or clever proofs to show if there is a forced win or draw.

6m1fpl,It's been hot as hell lately and got up to 100 yesterday. I started to wonder why I was sweating and feeling like I'm dying when my body is 98.6 degrees on the inside all the time? Why isn't a 98 degree temp super comfortable? I would think the body would equalize and your body wouldn't have to expend energy to heat itself or cool itself.   And is there a temperature in which the body is equalized? I.e. Where you don't have to expend energy to heat or cool. An ideal temperature.  Edit: thanks for all the replies and wealth of knowledge. After reading a few I remembered most of high school biology and had a big duh moment. Thanks Reddit!  Edit: front page! Cool! Thanks again!,"Your body is a like a heater that is always on; it cannot be turned off because that heat is produced by and required to maintain a delicate environment for your life processes. Heat only flows from hot to cold. If temperatures are equal, there is no cold for the hot to flow to. If 98F is ambient temperature then the constantly-produced heat in your body has nowhere to flow to. The heat will build up in you and you will overheat. The rate of heat flow is proportional to the difference between the hot and the cold. Even if your internal temp reaches 105F+ and outside is 98F the heat flow would be small. We evolved sweating as a way to cheat this by using evaporation to pull away heat from our skin. When water evaporates, it actually cools down when doing so, because changing a liquid to a gas takes energy (heat). This works so long as the surrounding air isn't already full of water. Once it is full, sweat stops evaporating and you will overheat no matter what. This kills people.",6577

6uijoe,Does sipping over time vs 'chugging' water impact the bodies ability to hydrate if the amounts of water are the same?,"Ok, this will likely get buried, but I'll give an explanation. After you ingest (swallow) water, it goes to your stomach. There, it is slowly released to your small intestine to be absorbed and pass to your bloodstream. It takes water between 10 and 40 minutes to pass to your small intestine and be absorbed. The speed of this depends on how much water, the temperature (cold water will be released slower), if there is something else in the stomach, etc. But, in general, it doesn't matter whether you chug a bottle of water down in 10 seconds or slowly sip it in 10 minutes. It will all end up in your bloodstream in about the same time. The only thing that can make a difference is whether you vomit the water that you are ingesting. You stomach vomits its contents in response to a series of things (whether it senses that something you ate may be rotten or dangerous, whether there is a bad smell, etc), and one of those things that the stomach takes into account is how full it is. So ingesting water in small sips can help avoid vomiting, and that is what's recommended when for example children have gastroenteritis. But if you don't vomit the water that you swallow, it doesn't matter whether you swallowed it in 10 seconds or 10 minutes. Edit: Wow, thanks for all the upvotes. Turns out it didn't get buried after all! This is 1/4 of my total karma right there! Glad you liked it! Edit2: it's actually not clear whether cold water will be released (and thus absorbed) slower.

71y0zc,Is there some difference in how the fat behaves in a jar vs. a living duck?,"No, the fat isn't sloshing around, despite it being liquid - just like the ~60% that is water isn't  sloshing around. It isn't right to think of the components of an organism as discreet lumps that act like you'd expect the pure form to act out of the body, because the components are encapsulated in complex structures in the body. In the body fat is stored in fat cells, called adipocytes. These cells are held in place in a complex web of connective tissue, with strong proteins like collagen supporting them. Inside the cells the fat is stored in tiny spheres called inclusions, which are in turn given structure by their own families of proteins, and they are held in the structural proteins of the cell as a whole. Ultimately all this results in the fat being held pretty rigidly in place. It acts more like a gel. Edit: Sorry I missed addressing a flaw in the question. The fat in a duck is *always* a liquid, regardless of the outside temperature - because ducks maintain their temperature at ~100f. This is really important. If the fat becomes solid it isn't as easy/is nearly impossible to move around or use when the body needs it. If the fat is solid, it is safe to assume the duck is no longer. -also- the correct word for lipid droplets in cells.",7751

Also thanks for responses Edit 2: My karma just tripled. thanks homies,"Whoa something I can answer - I worked on the Lunar Greenhouse Module at the University of Arizona!  Bioregenerative Life Support Systems could continually produce oxygen and some amount of food (our goal was always atmospheric conditioning with food production as a windfall of that). In fact, you kind of have to decide if you'd like the plants to focus on growing leaves for oxygen production or fruits for food production. Either way, there are a lot of challenges in feeding those plants. We proposed using composters to recycle human waste to make the system fully sustainable, as plants ""breathe"" pure water out which could then be utilized as drinking water as well. I don't know all the details about that part of it, as that wasn't my section. We also intended to use Fresnel lenses with fiber optic cables to deliver sunlight directly to the plants, with blue and red LEDs as a backup (it'd be placed underground because the moon lacks an atmosphere to burn up space debris). Unfortunately, hydroponics would have difficulty in a low gravity environment like the ISS without some real specialized design, which the plants may not like. The moon would give us an environment that is a little more familiar to us and the plants.

76jaue,"We always see these apocalypse shows where the small groups of survivors are trying to carve out a little piece of the earth to survive on, but what about those nuclear power plants that are now without their maintenance crews? How long could they last without people manning them?","Nuclear engineer and senior reactor operator here.  Current day nuclear plants are not designed to go for more than 10-30 minutes post transient without human interaction. The logic and safety systems are only designed to respond to transients for immediate core protection and plant safety and do not bring the plant automatically to a cold shutdown condition.  Generation 3+ plants (none in commercial operation yet), do have up to 1 week of walk away safety, but require operator actions to ensure long term core cooling.  The bottom line is you can't leave a nuclear reactor. It takes a year or more before decay heat is low enough to prevent a zirconium fire and core melt or spent fuel pool fire.  Operators like myself are licensed at the plant and we cannot leave our watch station until someone else with a license turns over with us. So every day I go in, I cannot leave until someone else who is licensed and qualified for my position takes over. I've done some long shifts due to people calling in sick.  As for the plant side: you have to monitor and maintain equipment. Pumps need oil. Tanks need water filled (or drained). Systems need pressure vented. This stuff happens day to day, so without operators, equipment will fail and the plant will trip.  Best case scenario, you cool the plant down to cold shutdown and leave it in shutdown cooling mode. If power trips off or anything malfunctions you'll lose core cooling again though, as shutdown cooling typically doesn't have auto restarts.  Bottom line: you can't leave a nuclear reactor. And they won't be left unattended. ",5261

7engan,"I assume the answer is yes, given the heat of the sun, but... How close would you have to be? Could you do it and remain alive to eat your space s'more given a properly shielded spacecraft? Would the outside of the marshmallow caramelize? How would the vacuum of space affect the cooking process?","Near earth?  No.  The amount of heat from the sun just outside Earth's atmosphere isn't that much higher than what hits the surface--the atmosphere is mostly transparent. There is some distance at which you'd be close enough; I'm not in a position to do the math, but expect it to be close than Mercury.  Perhaps try making a request on /r/theydidthemath if you don't get specific numbers here. At that distance it would be difficult but possible to shield a spacecraft, allowing it to be crewed. The main reactions that go into caramelization don't depend on oxygen, so I see no reason why the marshmallow wouldn't caramelize.  It wouldn't catch fire if you're doing this in the vacuum of space. One notable effect of the vacuum of space is that the marshmallow would expand *substantially* as you removed it from the atmosphere.  You can look up YouTube videos of marshmallows in vacuum chambers to get an idea of this. **** Edit, since everyone feels the need to make the same comments: Space can be very hot. Thermodynamics in space are quite different from on the ground, and I didn't intend to imply that *temperature achieved* would be similar just above Earth's atmosphere as it is on the ground.  In space the thermodynamics of an object are almost entirely governed by radiation. Solar radiation is about 1 kW per m^2 on the surface, or about 1.3 kW just above the atmosphere; those are the same order of magnitude, hence my opening statement.  ~~Ultimately I would expect a marshmallow to be fairly similar thermodynamically to the moon; both are fairly white and fairly spherical. Temperatures on the moon are not hot enough to toast a marshmallow, though they can be very hot (as much as 100 C in sunlight).  Its important to note that the moon sees extreme temperature differences because there's no effective way for heat to transfer from the sunlit side to the dark side; it's too big for conduction to be relevant. On a marshmallow scale conduction would be very relevant and would allow the entire marshmallow to be a more moderate temperature than areas of the moon see.~~ I rescind any comparison to the moon.  On the scale of a marshmallow conduction dominates.  The side facing the sun would be quite hot and the side facing away would be quite cold, but exactly how hot and cold depend significantly on internal conduction.  Regardless, no toasting could occur as that would require near perfect black body absorption and near perfect insulation.  My initial estimate of ""closer than Mercury"" is probably closer than you need, but I stand by my claim that it's not hot enough near earth. ",3253

7gecrm,"Why does the oil need to be changed and not just “topped up”? Is the oil becoming less lubricating? Edit: Yes I realize 6000km does not equal 3000miles, but dealers often mark these as standard oil change distances.  Thanks for the science answers!","Mechanic here. The whole 3000 miles / every three months is now a myth used to sell more oil. Back when cars didn't have oil filters you had to change it every 500 to 1000 miles, later filters became a standard feature on engines, but because the motor oil of those days was... simple (read shit), you had to change it frequently. Modern oil has advanced leaps and bounds over the early days of motoring, and you can say it's high tech. Conventional motor oil can easily last 7500 miles or longer and synthetic oils can easily cover 10000 to 15000 miles or more. Not just that but a quality filter can withstand at least 10000 miles if not 20000, safely too.  I also see a lot of people saying that the sole job of oil is to lubricate. That's simply not true. The oil in your engine lubricates, yes, but it also regulates temperature, cleans the motor, seals the motor, and provides corrosion protection.  Bonus fun fact: Old synthetic oil used to leak because the molecules are much smaller in synthetic oils and unlike regular oil, it didn't saturate the seals, letting them dry up, and break/crack causing the leaks further. Modern synthetic oils contain seal conditioning additives so it simply isn't an issue any more. You can also go from synthetic to conventional and back, or mix and match with no issue - that is unless your car requires synthetic oil, in which case DO NOT put regular oil in it.   EDIT 2 - u/logicblocks pointed out that I didn't explain what happens to the oil. That's my bad.  SO, what happens to the oil when it reaches its life expectancy, be it 3K or 30K Well it's not the oil that goes bad, it's the additives. The additives break down faster than the actual oil. The tricky part is that it is the additives that extend the life of the oil. The additives break down, they no longer keep the oil viscous and 'slippery.' The lubricant part is simple enough. The oil stops being an effective lubricant. The viscosity is a bit more complicated. As the oil gets 'used up' it no longer maintains the viscosity required by the engine. Most engines have a range of use, such as summer and winter oil. As it breaks down, oil thins out, meaning it no longer moves through the engine at the required pressure to ensure proper lubrication. If the oil is not used up, but old, it thickens up and effectively becomes grease, which your oil pump would struggle to push said clumped up oil, burns out, no oil anywhere, good bye engine. If your oil pump is an absolute badass and pushes the thickened up oil into the valve train, shit goes south in a hurry, too. To sum up, you want your oil to be flowing at a specific rate to ensure that it goes everywhere. Too thin, it moves too fast, it doesn't stick to surfaces and it doesn't do much - you might as well be running water. Too thick and you add unnecessary stress to the engine, ruining the fine tolerances of the motor.  EDIT - Some people pointed out about burning oil and pre-existing leaks. One VERY important detail about going longer than your 'dealership' interval... CHECK YOUR OIL LEVEL!!! Especially with aging cars, it is NEVER a good idea to fire and forget. The one big advice I can give to anyone of any skill level. KEEP UP WITH YOUR MAINTAINANCE !!!! You can check your oil level, your tire pressure, and other minor things that will keep your car running for much longer.

7k296s,"I get clearing more than 100 meters, for noise reduction and buildings. But why set cruising altitude at 33,000 feet and not just 1000 feet? Edit oh fuck this post gained a lot of traction, thanks for all the replies this is now my highest upvoted post. Thanks guys and happy holidays ","There are generally a few reasons.  One of the biggest being that higher altitude means thinner atmosphere and less resistance on the plane.  There's also the fact that terrain is marked by sea level and some terrains may be much higher above sea level than the takeoff strip and they need to be able to clear those with a lot of room left over. Lastly, another good reason is simply because they need to be above things like insects and most types of birds. Because of the lower resistance, at higher altitudes, the plane can almost come down to an idle and stay elevated and moving so it also helps a lot with efficiency.  Edit:  Forgot to mention that weather plays its part as well since planes don't have to worry about getting caught up in the lower atmosphere where things like rain clouds and such form.",18179
7law0k,"I've been wondering this for a long time and has never really found an answer to this. When a game has a certain percentage chance of getting a critical hit for instance, how does it decide wether or not give you one? I don't quite understand how a computer can just randomly decide something without having a real conscience. It's not like in real life where you can flip a coin or something, it has to have a certain pattern instead, right? ","Well that depends - are you asking what algorithm they use to determine a critical hit?  Or how the random component of that works? Because the former is basically ""whatever teh programmer wants"".  But how an RNG (Random Number Generator) works is much more interesting. As you've apparently surmised, computers are deterministic.  They don't do things randomly - everything has defined inputs and defined outputs.  So how do they generate a random number, right?  That's why *this is actually a really good question*. They use what's called a ""pseudorandom number generator"" (PRNG) which is a program that *isn't* random.  It's not.  It's just a mathematical formula that's so crazy it *looks* random... but it is still deterministic. It can't pull the number from nowhere, so it needs an *input*.  I put in a 1, I get 81.  I put in a 2, I get 875.  I put in a 3, I get 294. What's important is that, being deterministic, when I put in a 1 again, **I still get 81 back**. Now, to make it simple, they sometimes hide this input number so it loops on itself - so I only provide the *first* number, and then each subsequent run of the PRNG, it will just use the last number it generated. So I put in a 1, and I get 81, and then I don't have to put in something again - it will use 81 next time to get, say 788 for me.  And then I'll ask it for another number, and it will use 788 as its input to generate... say... 294. What's important is that this is *still* deterministic.  If I start up a new RNG, and I seed it with the number 1 again?  It will still return 81, 788, 294, etc. in that order. This is called ""seeding"" a random number generator.  If you play minecraft, that word sounds familiar - many procedurally-generated videogames will let you provide a ""seed"" - now you know what that means!  The ""seed"" is the first number for the RNG, so if you use the same seed to run the procedurally-generated world twice, you get the same world twice, because it wen through the same pseudorandom numbers in the same order. Now, what if I don't provide a seed?  Well then the computer needs to find a seed by itself.  The clock works.  The current date and time is always unique.  You can get pretty good random numbers by seeding from the clock (note, a computer's ""clock"" includes the date).  Seed from a number that is the total number of milliseconds that's passed since January 1st, 1970. The challenge is when you need to be really sure that nobody else can figure out your random number.  It needs to be a secret.  This is important for encryption.  Everybody knows what time it is, and if they know your pseudorandom number generation algorithm, they can make the same numbers. That's when sources of ""entropy"" are important.  Source of chaos that the computer can read to find something *truly* random it can use to seed the RNG.  Fluctuations of the electrical power supply is a good source for this, for example.  Reading this data is slow, so it's still just used as a seed - after that initial fetch from the truly random source, the computer still just calculates the next random number from the previous ones. edit: on Entropy, the most *extreme* source of randomness is quantum physics.  Quantum physics are fundamentally random.  And the easiest-to-detect form of quantum physics?  **radioactivity**. [So here's a video of some guys using deadly radioactive Strontium-90 to generate random numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxP30euw3-0) Seriously, if you like computers and you like videos, if you have a question about computers look up Computerphile on Youtube.  They do *fantastic* work. edit2: wow, this blew up like nothing I've ever written.  Okay, I feel I should clarify something: these are toy examples.  A real, proper PRNG is dealing with much larger numbers than 788 (a 32-bit integer has 4 billion values, and a 64-bit integer has 18 quintillion values) and then they're hammered into the range the programmer wants *after* the PRNG is done calculating them.  Second, the ""input"" can be more than just the one previous value.  For example, the Mersenne Twister is one of the most common PRNGs, and it stores *hundreds* of old random numbers and uses them all to help generate the next one.",11677

7pchkq,"I was eating a dark chocolate bar and noticed even when scored with large grooves half the thickness of the bar, the chocolate wouldn't always split along the line. I was wondering if perhaps it had to do with how the chocolate was tempered or the particle sizes and grain in the ingredients, or something else. I also noticed this happens much less in milk chocolate, which would make sense since it is less brittle. ","Materials engineer and here, so I'll weigh in.  The answer stating it's an amorphous material is part of the answer.  It's not a complete answer since the milk chocolate is also an amorphous material and doesn't exhibit the failure mode to the same level.  Plus, both are not 100% amorphous since there is some recrystallization during cooling, I'm sure.  The other key here is the dark chocolate is harder, and more brittle.  This means when breaking the material, more energy is required (input to the equation) which leads to a brittle and catastrophic failure (more energy out in a shorter period of time), thus less controlled and more random.  It's also why you'll see more sharp fragments in the break vs. softer/weaker materials such as the milk chocolate. The other note here is regarding the squares in the bar formed by the mold, and why the break doesn't always follow the pattern.  This has to do with the sharpness at the bottom of the valley of the pattern as well as the break direction.  A stress riser is formed (on the tension side) in the valley that is proportional to 1 / square of the radius of the groove.  The sharper the groove, the higher the stress.  Many of these squares have large radius grooves in them, for looks, but they don't concentrate the force very well to drive the cracking to happen at the groove; especially if you hold the bar with the grooves towards you and push away - the tensile force is now on the surface without grooves.  Break the other way to have a higher chance of perfect squares.",4589

So if Ethiopia builds a dam close to the source of the water and stores it there this will have results downstream. A minor effect would be the evaporation from the lake which would be lost to the region (the recycling factor in the Ethiopian highlands is small). A major effect would be a quick fill which would temporarily cut off water supply to the downstream areas. A long term effect would be that in times of drought Ethiopia has control over the distribution and can keep more water for itself. All of these are negative effects for Egypt's water security. As for the claim that Egypt's waterflow is increased by reducing Lake Nasser evaporation, this is really a wry statement. It means that they might reduce the level of Lake Nasser by siphoning of more water upstream thereby decreasing the volume of the lake and the area from which it can evaporate. That might slightly reduce evaporation in Egypt which is what they could mean by ""increased water flow"" but I don't see how Egypt's total water budget would increase because of this.

All sorts of claims have been made about cancer in the post. So, how realistic is this? ","So, immunotherapy has long been seen as a holy grail for cancer treatment. The immune system is naturally programmed to attack cells that have gone a bit weird (to use the scientific term). The problem tends to be that the cancer cells can also alter themselves so that they are disguised from the immune system, or in fact inhibit any immune cells that come into contact with them. This stops the immune system from seeing them as dangerous, allowing the cancer to grow. So the balance of the immune response is in favour of leaving the cancer alone. What this treatment does is inject the tumour with molecules that tell the immune cells in the vicinity of the tumour to wake up and start doing their job, overcoming the inhibition that the cancer cells have put in place. This means that the balance of the immune response is now to attack the tumour, which seems to work very well. The really cool thing is that now that the immune system is trained to see the tumour as bad, and will attack similar cells in different sites. This is why it behaves in some fashion like a vaccine. It's perfectly viable, and very exciting. As always, there is always the question of how well it translates into human biology but it is still very promising. I think one problem is going to be how specific the immune response is. In the paper, they see the immune cells are trained to attack cells with protein markers unique to the tumour cells, which is a good sign. One concern might be that if you accidentally trigger the immune response to normal cell markers, it could cause your immune system to attack healthy cells which would obviously be a very bad consequence. Another would be how readily a tumour can evolve to overcome the immune system attack. If the immune system only ends up going for certain markers, it could miss tumour cells that don't have the same ones. These could then continue to grow and cause the cancer to return.

Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh descended in asubmersible called the Trieste, which could withstand over 16,000 pounds of pressure per square inch. Their descent to the bottom in cramped quarters took five hours, but provided our first glimpses of the seafloor and life at the ocean’s greatest depths. The Mariana Trench represents just one small part of the Earth’s last, great frontier. Less than five percent of the entire ocean has been explored, yet scientists have found that even the deep sea has great numbers of species—and the discoveries have only just begun"" Interesting info from wikipedia: ""As of February 2012, at least two other teams are planning piloted submarines to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Triton Submarines, a Florida-based company that designs and manufactures private submarines, plans for a crew of three to take 120 minutes to reach the seabed.[28] DOER Marine, a marine technology company based near San Francisco and set up in 1992, plans for a crew of two or three to take 90 minutes to reach the seabed."" ""In 2011, it was announced at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a multibeam echosounder conducted a survey which mapped the entire trench to 100 metres (330 ft) resolution.[2] The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former seamounts."" So we have mapped it roughly but their appears to be plenty more to discover. Also a cool fact on the wiki: ""The trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the Earth. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere; its radius is about 25 kilometres (16 mi) less at the poles than at the equator.[6] As a result, parts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) closer to the Earth's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor.""

7v0z9e,"Edit: Thanks everyone for many different perspectives and interesting arguments! One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place. Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education.  I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge? An educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education. However, in case there is a trend of a growing educational gap, what concerns me is the possible emergence of an **educational divide**. Depending on the definition of ""educational divide"" and high-quality data available, such divide might potentially be underway.","Re most comments in this thread that have been removed: /r/askscience is not the right place for speculation / personal take on the matter.

7vgwdg,"The depth of the lava zone is roughly 1200-1500 meters, and the gravity seems similar to Earth's. Could this happen in real life, with or without those conditions?","Oh shoot!  As a geoscientist and a huge Subnautica fan, I'm sorry to come in late on this. **No**, the lava depicted in the lava zone is completely unrealistic (but *so* cool.)  Let me comment on the pieces of the answer that people have already given: As /u/Little_Mouse points out, real underwater volcanism on Earth doesn't have much glow to it: the water cools the lava so fast that it's almost all dark except for a few glints of red.  Their video was taken at shallow depth by a scuba diver: here's a video from 1 km deep, similar to the lava zone in Subnautica: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmMlspNoZMs No glowing pools, no red lava falls.  Water is a fantastic reservoir for heat, and the fact that warm water rises lets it carry away heat by convection really *really* well. /u/PresidentRex has a great analysis of pressures and the phase diagram of water, but there's one thing they didn't realize: **hot supercritical water is always less dense than cold**, as shown in the graphs [here](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_density.html).  Thus, there will be no ""stable layer of supercritical water"": it would be buoyant, rise, and be replaced by cool water, carrying away heat by convection. What if the layer of water near the lava surface had a ton of salts dissolved in it, so it was denser?  As /u/Bassmanbiff points out, the thermal radiation law applies to *everything*, not just rock: the supercritical water layer *itself* would glow.  But that's clearly not what we see in Subnautica, and in any case the water above this layer would still convect, rapidly cooling it just as if it were lava itself. Finally, as /u/UniqueUserTheSecond points out, there's a thermometer in the game, and it reads 70 degrees C in the active lava zone.  That's probably a reasonable temperature, actually -- note that in the video I linked to, the submersible isn't damaged by the volcano's heat, and /u/Little_Mouse 's video was taken by a scuba diver swimming just a few feet from the lava!  But this is nowhere near the temperature at which stuff starts to glow -- no matter what stuff. As a side note, several people are commenting on air pressure and O2.  One thing's for sure: the way Subnautica handles air and breathing at depth is completely wrong, and trying to dive the way you can in Subnautica would kill you dead.  Nobody in the real world has done a dive on pressurized gas to a depth greater than 700 meters, the people who've done it to a depth below 100 meters only do so with hours of preparation, a special gas mixture, and slow cautious pressure changes, and even then many people who've tried to dive below 300 meters have died.  The vehicles and seabases behave as if they are at sea-level pressure (if they weren't, they wouldn't implode if you take them too deep), but you can't just hop from 800 meters of pressure into your sea-level pressure vehicle without dying immediately.  And let's not even talk about how moonpools work.... Of course, a realistic approach to lava and air pressure wouldn't make for nearly as fun a game!",4743
7wmirx,"I was watching the TV show ""Forever"", and they were preforming an autopsy, when they said the speaker had a British accent due to the palate not being deformed by the hard definitive sounds of English (or something along those lines) does this have any roots in reality, or is it a plot mover?","I don't believe there is any evidence to support that language affects palate morphology. However, vice versa it may be that morphology affected the development of (aspects of) languages. For example, see these two paragraphs from a [2015 conference paper by Moisik and Dediu](http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/faces/viewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=escidoc:2166182): > It is an undeniable fact that human populations vary in certain systematic ways in their anatomy and physiology. This is true at both micro- and macroscopic levels, and advances in genetics will continue to elucidate the extent of these patterns of variation across populations. Early in the development of modern phonetic and phonological science, several proposals (e.g. [[24]](http://www.worldcat.org/title/reader-in-historical-and-comparative-linguistics/oclc/220270) and [[2]](https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/17928687?selectedversion=NBD4131403)) were made which held that some of the diversity observed in speech sound systems around the globe might be owing to systematic variation observed in the anatomy and physiology of the speakers of language, in addition to the other factors driving language change and diversification. These ideas were hastily dismissed as implausible, on the grounds that any human being can learn any human language. >  > It is an incontrovertible fact that normal variation of the human vocal tract does not preclude an individual from acquiring any spoken language. However, the hypothesis that human vocal tract morphology exerts a bias on the way we speak seems plausible, and the possibility that such biases might have expressions at the level of populations of speakers has never been satisfactorily ruled out. It also seems to have resulted in the unfortunate side- effect that details of vocal tract shape are rarely if ever correlated to production variables in phonetic research. A relatively recent return to the question of whether normal vocal tract variation can indeed exert such biases reflects the unresolved nature of the problem. Many examples exist for such research examining the individual level (e.g. [[25]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261256855_Palatal_Morphology_Can_Influence_Speaker-Specific_Realizations_of_Phonemic_Contrasts), [[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19507976), and [[18]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4492454/)), and these are laden with implications for impacts at broader levels, with some researchers even suggesting it may be a driver of change of certain aspects of entire phonological systems (e.g. [[1]](http://cogprints.org/3286/), [[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21615290), and [[17]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23811472)). Of course, this wouldn't help you identify which language someone spoke while alive.",1476

It's hard to reduce this to an ELI 5 level, but I'll give it a shot.  Say you're driving through a small, simple town with one street light at that town's rush hour: all the traffic will come up, pause, then go with a regular rhythm.  That would be a high degree of order (the opposite of entropy).  Not much communication or flexibility needed, and its the mental equivalent of a deep sleep.  If you compare that to downtown tokyo, there are people everywhere, going in all directions on foot and in cars and bikes, etc.  That's a lot of information flowing in many directions, and if we turn them in to brain cells they are busy, active, and adaptable.  Chaotic systems have more energy and more going on than simple systems, and we measure this in terms of entropy (which is honestly a misnomer, it's all meaningful, but the math for entropy works as a best model).      All of this is fueled by blood flow to get oxygen to the cells, but it's not a 1:1 correlation.  Having said that, the main measure they used is a measurement of where water/blood goes in the brain (fMRI).  The study said that since caffine restricts blood flow, it should slow the brain down, but the chemical makes the cells all over the brain fire more easily, so lower blood flow but higher levels of cross-talk and entropy.      So is it good or bad?  Yes.  It's good for the short term, making thinking more efficient and clear, but it's not good for the long term because you're making the cells work harder with less fuel.      That also explain why withdrawal from caffine causes headaches, btw.  Withdrawal from a chemical causes the opposite of the chemical's effect, so when you don't drink coffee after getting addicted, the blood flow in the head increases, causing higher pressure, which leads to pain.",3414

82rhw8,"Edit: I just want to clarify, I'm aware of what dark matter and dark energy are. I'm by no means an expert, but I do have a basic idea. I'm wondering specifically how we got those particular numbers for them.","We can calculate things like gravity and energy density of the universe base on how the galaxies behave on a cosmic scale.  We can also calculate how much stuff is out there by direct observation.  When we look at the cosmos and look at how the galaxies behave, there is not enough material to generate the gravity (even when accounting for all the gas and dust that may obscuring it).  So there's some matter that doesn't emit light but still generates that gravity we see.  We call it dark matter, because that's what it is: dark. There's also an expansion to the universe that suggests that the energy density is not what we can directly measure.  There's a bunch of stuff out there causing the universe to expand at an accelerated rate.  We call it dark energy, because, hey, we have dark matter already--why not call it ""Dark Energy""; that way it sounds cool. So there's like 5 times as much matter as what we can see, and like 3 times as much energy density as what can be explained by that matter.  So that's where the percentages come from: just add up all the stuff we know about that makes up the universe even if we don't yet know what that stuff is.",4808

One way of finding new species is (nowadays, less invasive methods are preferred) to go to the Amazon (or any other biodiverse ecosystem) and find a large tree (which shouldn't prove much of a challenge), spread a large sheet beneath the tree and then gas the whole tree to send every (formerly) living thing flying down onto your nice big sheet. You can then easily classify every animal. Scientists would then find that a large percentage of the animals collected were previously unknown species.

8emto6,"Would that actually show up on google earth, or would it be too small?","[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch), the plastic density of the patch is about 5kg/km^2 and it covers the region between 135°W to 155°W and 35°N to 42°N.  That region is about 1.3 M km^2 since a degree of lattitude is about 111 km and a degree of longitude, at 40°N, is about 85 km. So the total plastic mass is about 7 million kg or 7 thousand tons.

8eu5ua,"I mean not standing on a dune, just standing on fairly level sand at whatever average altitude from sea level any given desert is, how far down can the sand go? Can it be very deep or just a few inches before you hit different material? Does it vary greatly from one desert to another?","How deep can it be? Very deep. Over half a mile, perhaps as much as mile under very special circumstances.  The thickness of sand under the dunes is going to depend on the length of time that deposition was greater than erosion. In a desert, deposition = sand being blown in, and erosion=sand being blown out. If you were to measure these rates in (thickness)/(time), you can imagine that it is possible to get a lot of sand built up in short times relatively speaking. However, the rate of erosion will increase if you build sand ""up""-- so what you need is accommodation space where sand can accumulate.  And there are thick sandstones, such as those that form the ancient geology of the American west, which you can see at parks such as [Arches](https://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm) in Utah. When you see all the rocks at Arches, you are seeing a HUGE pile of what remains of thousands and thousands of sand dunes that were partially buried in accommodation space provided by evacuating salt.  [The Navajo Sandstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Sandstone) is up to 2,300 ft thick, but it's been compressed--it would have been thicker before it was buried and re-exposed. And, there is some additional amount of material that would have been on top that has eroded. So, at *least* half a mile. But also very cool--the Navajo sandstone was being deposited over a period of 15 million years, so the net rate of addition might have been around 2,300 ft/15 million years = 1/10000 ft/year. That's a tiny net amount, and we know that accumulation happened in fits and starts--there are packages that are the ""base"" of sand dunes that are 30' thick that show all their original structure, which means that 30' thick sand dune was laid down millions of years ago and never reactivated. So it was a lot of boring time and then *boom*, your sand dune gets buried and stays.  Why was there so much sand accumulation there? The answer is [salt tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_tectonics). If you fill up a basin with sea water and keep evaporating, you can end up with salt a mile thick. Then, if you blow sand over it, you end up with a sandy desert dune on top of your mile thick salt. And here's the cool thing: sand dunes are denser than salt *so they start sinking into it*. That's where the accommodation space comes from!  One last thing: these thick sands are great places to hold oil, and have been important targets of exploration all across the world.  ",15509

For example: if a human body has multiple fractures, severed nerves, multiple lacerated organs, internal bleeding and cuts and bruises, how does the body react to the healing process? Which of the wounds and damaged areas it starts to heal first?  I am aware of different kinds of shocks and reactions to the human body, but lets cast those aside. Is it strictly related to DNA only or is there some sort of other mechanisms the body/brain uses? ","Hematology MD here - good question!  If you're thinking of the body like the Enterprise or something (damage control teams to E deck!) the short answer is no, there isn't a mechanism like that, with a set reserve of 'repair ability.' Since your question focuses on two different 'levels' of damage, e.g. at the DNA/cellular level, and in the trauma setting e.g. lacerated organs, internal bleeding, cuts/bruises etc, I'll answer them separately. On a cellular level, multiple DNA repair mechanisms exist - Dr Paul Modrich won the nobel prize in 2015 for exploring some of these. The individual cell has an incredible ability to reconstitute / repair DNA following damage; if damage is so great that I can't be repaired, the cell will self-destruct, so to speak; failure to do so is one mechanism by which cancer arises. However, the ability of individual cells to repair themselves is distinct from that of macroscopic injuries. In the trauma setting, the circulating coagulation factors / prothrombotic pathways become activated, to stop bleeding. It's not a specific process (e.g. bypass the cut on your arm to stop the bleeding in your spleen) but rather occurs wherever the pro-coagulant mediators see damage. That's part of the problem in conditions like sepsis/severe injury - a condition called DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) develops with massive activation of the pro-coagulant pathways in an effort to stop bleeding (or as an 'accidental activation' in the setting of inflammation, where you get similar procoagulant markers expressed). In DIC, you get concurrent bleeding/clotting, since the pro-coagulant factors that are meant to stop bleeding are being used up faster than the body can produce them, while concurrently, clots (thrombi) are forming, often inappropriately.  It would actually be really helpful in the setting of DIC if something like a priority list did exist, so the less important injuries would be ignored and the more serious ones dealt with.  I hope that's helpful!  Edit: Thanks for the gold!! Glad folks found my reply informative!",3907

I’m a researcher on the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) team – there we publish interactive data visualisations and research on how the world is changing over a long-term perspective across a wide range of social, economic, environmental dimensions. Therefore I try to use data to inform my choices on how to tackle problems and what makes sense. The data visualisations linked to below might be helpful for you. These interactive maps are based on data published a 2015 [paper in Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768/) (the only global quantification of plastic reaching the oceans by country that I’ve seen). The data is for 2010 so not ideal, but I suspect this does not strongly affect the overall balance. Let’s work through this in steps: \- Per person, the amount of plastic waste we generate is mixed across the world, but typically higher in richer countries. Explore the map [here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-plastic-waste-generation). \- But, plastic waste across the world is not managed in the same way and therefore does not have the same probability of ending up in the ocean. Most of the waste that is collected and formally managed in proper landfills does not reach the ocean. We can define ‘mismanaged waste’ as waste that is littered or not formally managed and includes disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained. The authors note that this is the plastic waste which could enter waterways and move into the ocean. Per person, the global map changes significantly; richer countries tend to have much better waste management methods and therefore very low levels of ‘mismanaged waste’. Explore the map [here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mismanaged-plastic-waste-per-person). \- Of course, in terms of plastic which could reach the ocean, we’re interested in the total (not the per capita) plastic waste. This is how [that map looks](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mismanaged-plastic-waste). Here we see that the largest quantities of mismanaged plastic waste are regionally focused in Asia and across North Africa. As noted in the video, it tends to be in countries which have industrialized very quickly in recent decades and have large coastal populations. If we [plot mismanaged plastic waste against GDP per capita](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-mismanaged-plastic-waste-vs-gdp-per-capita), it tends to be highest at middle incomes.  So, what is the most effective way of addressing this? It’s true that the quantity of mismanaged plastic waste (that could enter the ocean) across rich countries is in balance, relatively small at the global scale. Europe as a whole, for example, probably sums to the order of 100s of thousands of tonnes per year (maybe up to a million). This compares to some countries in South-East Asia, in contrast, which produce the in the order of millions of tonnes in a single country. What can we do as **individuals**? There is the obvious at-home or local practices we can do: recycle as much as you can, don’t take plastic you don’t need, be conscious of how much you’re using and where you can reduce (but before of unintended consequences such as food waste).  But these practices alone are not close to enough. Sure, we should still do them, but only if they are additional to broader, more impactful action that higher-income countries take. They should not be a substitute, or a “we’ve banned plastic straws, so we’ve done our bit for the planet” campaign. If rich countries (and their populations) are as concerned and committed to this problem as they say they are then one of the most effective actions is to invest in waste management infrastructure across lower-to-middle income countries. Countries which have industrialized quickly have been left with insufficient waste management systems. If these are systems are not implemented and upscaled, then we will be unable to address this global problem. We could end plastic waste across Europe and North America and we would still have a major global problem. Note that this is not a finger-pointing blame game. This has been a consequence of economic growth, industrialization and globalisation which we all share responsibility for. It needs to be a collaborative effort to find the interventions which have the largest impact. So, governments should be investing in waste management infrastructure. Companies and industry should be taking responsibility for the redesign of new products which mimimise wastage. And as individuals we should be pressuring both into take these steps. Do your bit locally, but attempt to push for the high-impact global solutions too.",869

90s854,Title!,"Yes, there is a more or less standard way of solving this problem, but there is a lot of latitude. For instance, it's well possible that your biased coin gives you results that look perfectly unbiased for any arbitrary number of flips. So you can never know *for sure* whether your coin is biased or unbiased. Suppose we have the following, significantly *easier* problem. We have two coins, X and Y, one of which has probability of heads *p* and the other has probability of heads *q*. But we don't know which is which. We randomly choose one coin and our goal is to determine whether our coin has chance *p* or *q* of showing heads. Note that we *know* the values of *p* and *q* *a priori*; we just don't know which coin is which. For the solution to this problem, [you can read this post on StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2033370/how-to-determine-the-number-of-coin-tosses-to-identify-one-biased-coin-from-anot/2033739#2033739). The idea is that you need to flip the coin enough times so that you are confident that both you have X and that you don't have Y. The punchline is that if the coins have *p* and 0.5 as their chance for getting heads (so we are trying to distinguish a biased coin from an unbiased coin), then the minimum number of flips needed for a 5% error is roughly N = 2.71/(p - 0.5)^(2). Note that the closer the biased coin is to being fair, the more flips we need. If the biased coin is known to have, say, p = 0.51, then we need about 27,100 flips to distinguish between the two coins. [**edit:** Another user discovered a missing factor of 4 on the formula in the StackExchange post. I have since corrected the formula and the calculated value of n.] However, the problem posed in the title is much different since we do not know the bias of the coin *a priori*. This means that will not be able to write down the number of required flips once and for all. It depends on how biased the coin can be. As the calculation linked above shows, we may very well require arbitrarily many flips if the bias (deviation from fair) is allowed to be arbitrarily small. If the bias is bounded away from 0, then the above analysis can be applied to give an upper bound for the minimum number of flips. The best you can arguably really do in the general case is flip the coin with unknown bias many times and then consider a certain desired confidence interval. So let *p* be the unknown chance of getting heads on your coin. The procedure to distinguish this coin from fair would be as follows: 1. Flip the coin *n* times and record the results. Let *h* = observed proportion of heads. 2. Find the *Z*-value corresponding to a confidence level of γ. (There are plenty of calculators that can do this for you.) 3. Calculate W = Z/(2n^(1/2)). This expression comes from the fact that the standard error for *n* Bernoulli trials with probability *p* is (p(1-p)/n)^(1/2), and this expression is maximized when p = 1/2. (Remember we don't know the value of p, so that's the best we can do.) 4. The confidence interval for *p* is thus (h-W, h+W). Please note carefully what this confidence interval means. This means that if you were to repeat this experiment many times (or have many different experimenters all performing it independently of each other), then the proportion of experiments for which the confidence interval would actually contain the true value of *p* tends toward γ. It does *not* mean that there is a probability of γ that the true value of *p* lies in this particular interval (h-W, h+W), although that is a common misinterpretation. [**edit:** I've changed the description of a CI to be more intuitive and more correct! Thank the various followup comments for pointing this out to me.] As a particular example, suppose you flipped the coin 10,000 times and got 4,000 heads. You want a 99.99% confidence level. So h = 0.4 and γ = 0.9999. A confidence level calculator gives Z = 3.891, and hence W = 0.019455. Hence your confidence interval is (0.381, 0.419). So if many other people performed the same experiment and you collected all of the results, roughly 99.99% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true value of *p*, *and* they would all have the same length. So it's probably safe to say the coin is biased. Can't know for sure though based on just one CI. But if you repeat this process and get, say, 5100 heads, then your confidence interval is  (0.491, 0.529). So it's probably not safe to say the coin is biased in that case. In general, for this method, the number of trials required depends only on the desired confidence level. Whether you decide the coin is biased is a different question really. At the very least, you would want your confidence interval not to include p = 0.5. But this doesn't mean that can't be true. Confidence intervals are notoriously misinterpreted. Wikipedia has an article on this very problem. The method of using confidence intervals is described. Another method based on posterior distributions is also considered, and you can read the details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checking_whether_a_coin_is_fair#Posterior_probability_density_function).",4379
90ydcj,"E.g. my abdominal muscles will burn while doing crunches, while my arms will just stop moving while doing chin-ups.","**On crunches and 'the burn':**  Accumulation of metabolic waste product.  When doing an exercise with a muscular metabolic demand similar to crunches (high rep pushups and squat jumps would be similar), the limiting factor is metabolic waste product buildup.  The 'burn' you feel is the accumulation of metabolic waste (particularly lactic acid) from the chemical reactions making your muscles 'go'. At this exercise intensity, you are operating at a rate of power where your muscles are accumulating metabolic waste products faster than that waste can be pumped out and excreted or processed.  Think of the burn you feel as a warning alarm, and the point where you can't do any more reps like your body hitting the emergency shut-off switch so you don't damage your muscles with excess waste buildup.   *(Interesting anecdote: prey animals such as horses and rabbits have been known to 'run themselves to death,' as they seem to not have the same biophysiological safegaurds as humans in terms of the 'emergency stop' response to metabolic waste buildup.  Only time I've heard of a human doing that was the first ancient Marathon.) **On pullups and acute fatigue at high-maximal power output:** Because each rep requires substantially more force and power than each rep of, for example, crunches, the limiting factor here is creatine-phosphate (CP) availability.  You may have heard of 'creatine' in nutritional supplements; basically what creatine does is hold onto a phosphate, so when you break down adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) for energy, that creatine is waiting hooked up to a spare phosphate molecule to donate to spent adenosine-diphosphate (ADP), thus quickly and rapidly replenishing ATP for energy. However, creatine is limited within the muscle, so once you've used up all of the creatine-phosphate 'donations', you're just out and can't produce power at the same capacity anymore until you allow some recovery time for the now free creatine molecules to pick up free phosphate molecules so they're ready to be again donated to ADP.  It takes roughly 10-20 seconds operating at maximum power to exhaust the vast majority (I don't remember the percentage off the top of my head) of your creatine-phosphate within a given muscle.  Once this happens, you suddenly feel your muscles being unable to produce the required force for a movement, which is where the ""my arms just stop moving"" sort of feeling comes from. However! if you were to immediately jump off the pullup bar after a set and swap to a lower-resistance exercise using the same muscle groups (e.g. pulldowns, rows, etc.) you could continue operating with less force and power until you begin accumulating metabolic waste products in those muscle groups and get the 'burn'. **Source**: National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) 'Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning,' Third Edition; Editors: Thomas R.

Provides majority of power for the first 10-20 seconds of activity at high-maximal power output. Requires 3-5 min for recovery. *This reaction does not require oxygen. *Adaptaion mechanisms*: Increase in muscle cross-sectional area; shift of muscle fiber type towards faster-twitch glycolytic type (these fibers are actually whiter in color due to less blood demand) *Examples of activity with high phosphagen demand*: 40-100 yard dash, set of 5-15 reps of resistance training **Glycolytic system**: This system functions on the reaction of glycolysis within the cell cytoplasm. This chemical reaction replenishes ATP relatively quickly, but still more slowly than the phosphagen system. Glycolytic reactions create a byproduct of lactic acid (among other byproducts; citation needed), which can be cycled out and processed by the liver (if I recall correctly) or processed and used within the cell for aerobic respiration if the activity is at a low enough intensity. At high intensities, waste products from glycolysis accumulate and cause a burning sensation and eventual lack of muscular function until said waste products can be cycled out. *This reaction does not require oxygen. *Adaptation mechanisms*: Increased cytoplasmic glycolysis enzymes, shift of muscle fiber type towards faster-twitch glycolytic type (these fibers are actually whiter in color due to less blood demand) *Examples of activities primarily utilizing glycolysis*: 400 meter run; maximal set of pushups or other calisthenic exercise for trained individuals **Aerobic respiration**: Lastly, aerobic respiration. This is the process which is likely dominant right now as you're comfortably sitting at a computer screen operating at a low power output. If operating at a low enough power output, lactate from the aformentioned glycolysis reactions can be cycled to the mitochondria to be processed through the elector transport chain for ATP resynthesis. I'm not gonna get into the nitty gritty of all of these reactions, but aerobic respiration is more energy efficient than glycolysis, but a much slower process. Thus, aerobic respiration is the default mechanism used to supply energy at rest or at lower intensity/high duration activity (e.g. distance running) *Adaptaion protocol*: Increased capillary density, increased mitochondrial density, shift of muscle fiber proportion towards slower-twitch aerobic type (these fibers are more red in color due to increased capillary density.) *Examples of activity primarily utilizing aerobic respiration*: running >1 mile, hiking, average pace over the course of a workout, resting state **Disclaimer**: I work in the field; not academia.

93y26g,Rubbed smooth or jagged rock formations? What do we know about it?,"The surficial layer of bedrock will show the progressive effects of surface exposure followed by burial in a hot environment. Back when those rocks were exposed, they underwent chemical and mechanical weathering in hot climatic conditions with varying amounts of humidity.  The mechanical weathering consists in fracturation from unloading, and thermal expansion from day/night cycles, and grain plucking through eolian and fluviatile processes. The chemical weathering consists in re-equilibration of mineral assemblages to surface conditions, mostly the conversion of ferro-magnesian minerals and feldspar to various types of clay minerals  and oxydes. Carbonates undergo some degree of dissolution. These chemical transformations might result in volumetric changes which make the rock crumbly. Burial progressively brings these weathered rocks at depth, under a thickening layer of sediments. Remember that chemical weathering? The water involved in those processes is now loaded with dissolved minerals and works it's way down into the sediments and the weathered/fractured bedrock, where it will precipitate mostly carbonates (calcrete) but sometimes even silica (silcrete) which cements grains and rock fragments together.   All in all, a history of exposure and burial in a hot arid environment such as the Sahara leaves a deep and recognizable mark on the underlying rocks. EDIT: TLDR ...

9fgdv5,"I’ve seen a lot of conflicting articles on this, particularly regarding the large theropods and sauropods... is there any recent insight on it. —— Edit, big thank you to the mods for keeping the comments on topic and the shitposting away. ","Well then. Birds are dinosaurs, so everything we know about birds falls under the purview of your question. However, for extinct forms, we can also make inferences using a technique known as [phylogenetic bracketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_bracketing).  Dinosaurs are [archosaurs](http://archosaurmusings.wordpress.com/what-are-archosaurs/), the two living representatives of which are crocodylians and birds (see also our [FAQ on why birds are dinosaurs](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/biology/birds_are_dinosaurs)). If there's a character that both groups have, it was likely present in their common ancestor. Things like a four chambered heart (which evolved independently from the mammalian heart), [unidirectional airflow in the lungs](http://mappingignorance.org/2013/03/29/triassic-lungs-unidirectional-flow-in-alligators-breathing/), and nest-building/parental care are present in both birds and crocodylians, so they were probably present in their common ancestor. That means extinct dinos likely had those traits or lost them secondarily. We have fossils that confirm these some of inferences, like brooding of nests.  Interestingly, we've also recently found that alligators are monogamous over multiple mating seasons, as are many birds, so that could have implications for how we look at extinct archosaur behavior. Alligators will also show nest site fidelity, coming back to the same or nearby areas over multiple nesting seasons. Many crocs have [complex mating rituals](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/05/alligator-mating-physics/) as well, so these also seem to be ancestral to archosaurs.  As far as dinosaur reproduction goes, we've found a lot of similarities between the reproductive tracts in birds and crocs. For example, [alligators and birds form eggshells in similar ways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1547315). Most [""reptiles""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropsida) have [hemipenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemipenis), which are paired copulatory organs that are everted for mating. This is not true of archosaurs. Most birds have lost their penis, but some retained it (ducks and ratites like ostriches and emus are two examples). I don't know of any fossil dinosaur genitalia, but birds (those that have a phallus) and crocs each have a single phallus rather than the hemipenes of extant lepidosaurs. That's likely what other extinct archosaurs probably had. However, given the range in variation that we see in living birds alone, I'm sure dinosaur genitalia existed in all shapes and sizes. In short: - Dinosaurs probably ancestrally had penises similar to crocodylians and some birds, but they could have been lost in lineages like they were in many bird groups. - At least some brooded their nests. - They probably had mating displays like birds and crocs do. - Some may have been monogamous over multiple mating seasons like many birds and crocs.

He said it was phenol but phenol doesn't match up with his description. He's told me this story since I was a kid but now at 23 I'm curious as to if there are any chemicals that deadly and what they would possibly be used for.,"There certainly do exist some chemicals where just a few drops on your skin can kill you. The chemical in question needs to have two properties: 1. It needs to be lethal at very low concentrations (e.g. as measured by [the median lethal dose or LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) or a related metric). Specifically for your question we would require that a volume of ~0.5mL of the substance should be enough to kill a person. Quite a large range different solutions actually fit this bill. But then there is a second requirement: 2. The chemical needs to be easily absorbed through your skin, such that enough of the active component can cause damage. Your skin is actually a decent protective barrier for a lot of substances, but some compounds are more easily absorbed. A very famous example of a chemical that fits both criteria is [dimethylmercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylmercury). This is a powerful neurotoxin that is frankly terrifying. To quote the Wiki article: >The toxicity of dimethylmercury was highlighted with the death of Karen Wetterhahn, a professor of chemistry at Dartmouth College, in 1997. Professor Wetterhahn specialized in heavy metal poisoning. After spilling a few drops of this compound on her latex glove, the barrier was compromised and within minutes it was absorbed into her skin. It circulated through her body and accumulated in her brain, resulting in her death ten months later. In other words, even when wearing safety attire, just spilling a few drops on a glove was enough to send the researcher to an early grave. ",13278
9odirf,"I understand (or at least, I think I do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.

First, let me say that I was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much I understood about this subject at a base level.  To clarify the question, I believe what I was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. That seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  I will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. While I am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately: Can someone born without a limb as opposed to losing a limb later in life use myoelectric prosthetics? Why or Why not?","This is a amazing question and one I cannot fully anwer. The sheer complexity of the nervous system is mind boggling. From my understanding you phrasing however is somewhat flawed. Prosthetics don't 'interface', for lack of a better word, with nerves. They instead use the output of said systems. You're nerves send a signal to your muscles and the muscle responds in a way it's biologically designed to. We can read that response and use it as input. What is mystifying to a certain degree is that even though you would expect our nerves and muscles to be hard wired from brain to muscle this is actually not the case. Even though the nerves or wires run from A to B they don't seem to be hardset into performing a single function. The human body has adopted to be more flexible.  In essence a baby is a prime example. They will hit themselves in the face trying to get their arm movements right. It's like a robot running through calibration to asses their range of freedom. Given enough time a adult could rework their nervous system into signaling a appendage to respond to their desires. But to boil it down. Do people born without a arm lack the nerves to control a prosthetic? Biologically yes. Could they adapt to using a prosthetic arm? Yes, but it becomes harder with age. Don't have the time to provide sources atm but I hope others will do so as well and challenge my views on this topic. It's interesting to think about.",2453

One thing to keep in mind is that telescopes don't see ""far"", they're just good at capturing lots of light to see dim things, and at magnifying things to see things at higher resolution. So a low resolution telescope will still get the light from lots of distant galaxies, it just won't resolve them well enough to see them as individual galaxies - they'll just all get muddled up together. And a small telescope just won't capture many photons from these galaxies at all. But the cosmic microwave background comes from all directions, so it's not too hard to detect. Newer instruments have just been able to map it in higher precision.",7202

(Thank you all for your many responses!)","Before answering your question, I'd just like to point out that there is no permanently dark side of the moon. There is a far side of the moon, which never faces the earth, [but it experiences a normal cycle of sunlight as the moon goes around.](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-earth/Moon_phases_drawing.gif) During a full moon (as observed by humans), the far side of the moon is unlit. During a new moon, when the moon is between the earth and the sun, the far side is fully lit but unobservable from the earth. As for your question, the moon's orbital period and rotational period are the same because tidal forces between orbiting bodies tend to make these numbers the same. Tidal forces slightly deform the earth and moon in their orbits, which produce small torques on each other, which act to bring these periods together. Smaller objects become tidally locked more easily, such as moons (like the earth's), or planets like Mercury which are locked in a 3/2 resonance around the sun.  The moon is also acting to slow the earth's rotation, moving farther out in its orbit in the process. Eventually, many many billions of years from now (longer than the lifetime of the sun), the earth's rotation will become fixed as well, as the same side of the earth will always face the moon, as they all orbit and rotate at the same rate. Because the earth is so massive compared to the moon this will take a long time, but there are examples of this in the solar system- the Pluto-Charon system is 'doubly' tidally locked.

arkttl,An information i know is that with today’s science we only reached an efficiency of 26.6 %.,"That theoretical limit is called the shockley-queisser limit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit It has to do with the fact that photons that are absorbed by a semiconductor (silicon most commonly for solar cells) with a specific band gap.  For silicon that band gap is 1.1 electron volts. when light is shined on a solar cell, an electron is excited in the semiconductor material by the energy of the photon.  If that energy is high enough, the electron is excited to the conduction band, and it leaves behind a mobile, positively charged energy state called a hole.  Electrons and holes migrate to opposite electrodes in a solar cell to generate power based on their voltage difference.  Photons with energy lower than the band gap do not excite electrons enough to get over the band gap, and thus don't produce power, and photons with energy higher than the band gap will be absorbed, but relax back to the band gap energy before being transported to the electrode.  This relaxation process is complicated and has to do with the continuum of energy states accessible to electrons in the conduction band.  Those nearby energy states allow for nonradiative relaxation back to the band gap energy. So, the sun shines with a certain spectrum, and only a fraction of the photons will be high enough energy to be absorbed productively, and those above that energy will relax back to the band gap as well.   With this in mind, even a perfectly efficient cell at converting photons to electrons is limited in its overall efficiency because semiconductors have a specific band gap, and only a certain fraction of the incident radiation from the sun can supply that amount of energy.  The specific % limit will be different for semiconductors with different band gaps (CIGS, CdTe, perovskite, GaAs, organics etc), and would also theoretically be different if we had a different sun.",5262
aso35b,"For example, my parents are Arabic, we can all speak it pretty well except for my brother, he understands perfectly what we say, but he answers in a different language, he didn’t grow up in a different environment than ours, so I was wondering how is it possible to understand a language but not being able to talk it. P.S. I don’t know if the flair is correct, if it’s wrong can the mods change it? ","We often call the process of ""speaking"" a language [language production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_production). It's way more than just speaking. The first thing to keep in mind is that using language keeps your brain very busy. If you ever thought that the whole ""10% of your brain"" thing had even conditional truth to it, go take a look at fMRIs of people doing simple linguistic tasks — real talking uses most parts of your brain, as you're generally engaging spatial, quantitative, emotional, and all sorts of other reasoning on the fly as you're conjuring up words and orchestrating your various meat-flaps to represent them. When you're understanding a language, the number of steps you have to do is cut down dramatically. Your ear picks up acoustic signal; you bucket into phonemes, which if you're proficient is going to be sensitive to the language you're listening for; you build those sound-idea strings into morphological segments, which you gradually slot into phrases and sentences; and then, in normal listening, as you *infer* enough, you're pretty much done—you get the idea and it's just refining. There's time in there to do some quick spot-translations, to do some on-the-fly word order swaps, and other touch-up work, especially if the speaker isn't going at all-out max speed at you. Contrast that to language production. Hoo boy. First you have an idea; Sapir-Wharf debates notwithstanding, the very early concepts of what you're trying to say are at least *unspecialized* to a language's specific quirks. From the idea, you have to create a sentence structure around it. Maybe you normally use SOV ordering but you're trying to make an SVO sentence. That's a cognitive overhead tax on you. Then you start trying to find the right words. More overhead. Now you're trying to recall the right sounds to go along with it; more tax. Finally, while you're generally still trying to juggle all of that, you're trying to orchestrate those meat-flaps to make the unfamiliar sounds. More tax. It adds up! Without practice, it's just too much to do at full speed. And practice, in the meaningful sense, is an extremely contextual thing; replying to the questions and answers fixed to a topic in your textbook is going to only have a small crossover with the highly-inferred, highly chaotic banter you get in a real, typical conversation. Interestingly enough, there's an extra sociolinguistic aspect that kicks in where the self-awareness of speaking ""indirectly"" levies yet more of a cognitive hit, which helps explain why some people will objectively speak a language better when they're a bit drunk. So, tl;Dr? ""Speaking"" is a whole lot more than speaking, and it's hard work until you've done a lot of it in very representative environments—listening has many fewer and much more predictable difficulty variables in the speed and complexity, while production is just way more nuanced and complicated.

axqtel,"If you can't drink seawater because of the salt, why can't you just boil the water? And the salt would be left behind, right?","You can do this, and we do. It's call desalination. The process you describe is called distillation desalination, and historically was the only way to turn salt water into drinking water. However, this is getting less and less common these days. Now it is mainly done by ""reverse osmosis"" where pressure is applied to sea water to drive it through a special filter that separates the salt from the water. &#x200B; The reason these technologies are not more widely used is because they are expensive. Obviously distillation desalination requires you to boil water, when we're talking gigalitres of water a year, this means a lot of electricity is needed. Reverse osmosis isn't cheap either. You have to pump the water to develop pressure, and the reverse osmosis membranes are always getting fouled and damaged. Roughly speaking, the highest efficiency desalination plants make water at about 10x the price of rain water collection. That is why desalination is somewhat rare (though more common than a lot of people think) and is only used in large amounts in very dry places. Australia, for instance, is extremely dependent on desalination for drinking water, and the large desalination plant in the world operates in Saudi Arabia.  EDIT: I'm having lots of complaints from Australian. If your city's backup supply of water is desalination, you are dependent on it. Australia has some of the highest desalination capacity per capita in the world. The are huge plants in three states. I never said they supply your daily drinking water.",14213

If you are asking if there are known cases for a traditional immune response in the wild, I can't help you.

(Sorry for my crappy English) Edit: Thank you guys so much for the anwers and thanks dor the gold. This post litteraly started by a friend and me just joking around. Thanks","Your stool turns brown in the large intestine (colon). The brown color is NOT from bilirubin directly, but from a breakdown product of the bilirubin known as stercobilin.  Stercobilin is produced by bacteria in the gut once they have broken down bilirubin (which is broken down from the iron-containing part of your red blood cells that gets released when a red blood cell is destroyed, also known as heme). When red blood cells are injured, heme is released, and it gets absorbed by white blood cells (macrophages, basically these big dumb goons that float around eating whatever doesn't belong in the body) where it gets processed and then sent back into the blood to the liver. The liver will further process the Particle Formerly Known as Heme into bilirubin, which is then stored in bile and released into the duodenum (the part of your digestive system immediately after the stomach).  As the bilirubin progresses through the gut, it will be converted by bacteria into something called urobilinogen. Urobilinogen can be released in the blood or stay in the digestive system for excretion. The urobilinogen that remains in the gut will get eaten by bacteria in the colon; the waste product from these bacteria is stercobilin, and that's what gives poop its brown color. Whether you have an iron deficiency or not doesn't affect the color of your stool very much, unless the bleeding is in your actual GI tract which can cause black or tarry stools (from the clotted blood).

bbwc8o,"I wondered why did they ""elected"" this one instead of a closer one for instance? Thank you","Because it's really big. It's so big, that it looks bigger on the sky than closer black holes. We can talk about the ""angular diameter"" or ""apparent diameter"" of an object. This is how big it looks on the sky, rather than how big it really is. For instance, the Moon and the Sun have about the same angular diameter - half a degree - even though the Sun is much much bigger in actual size. This is of course because the Moon is much closer than the Sun. The super-massive black hole in M87 is about 3000 times bigger than the super-massive black hole in our own galaxy, and it's about 2000 times further away.

bew9ft,"CPUs ang GPUs have billions of transistors. Can a dead transistor kill the CPU? Edit: spelling, also thanks for the platinum! :D","I actually work for AMD and work on the test team, so I might be able to provide some insight!! As a lot of people said before, there are different bins, or SKUs you see, like the i7, i5, i3, they are in fact the same exact silicon, just with things disabled because they may not have worked. For example, if one of the cores doesn’t work, they can just disable another one, and instead of having an 8-core processor, they can sell it as a 6-core. Aside from disabling cores, another common place you see faulty transistors, are within fast internal memory called cache. Processors usually have a few Mb of cache, it’s common for some of the cache cells to be dead upon manufacturing, so manufacturers build some backup cache cells. And when running tests, we can find those dead cells, and reroute those dead cells to the new ones. So when a processor tries to write to a cache address that is dead, there is some microcode internally that reroutes it to the newly assigned back up cache cell. It is possible too that there is enough cache cells that are dead that they end up having to drop the bin from an i7 to an i5 for example. Also, there are a lot of transistors, and full circuits that are used simply for testing, and will never ever be used once the processor is on the shelf ready for someone to buy. These are called Design For Test features, or DFT.  An example of one of these are some structures called ring oscillators, which are basically really fast operating clocks, and their frequency can be affected by a lot of things, like heat and the health of the silicon. These are scattered all around the silicon at different points, and the frequency can be measured as another metric to heat at various parts of the silicon, as well as the health of the silicon at various parts, and they can also be averaged as another metric to gauge the overall health and possible operating frequency of the entire processor. However, they will never have any use once the processor is ready to be sold, and it’ll actually be impossible to access them. So really to answer your question, a lot a lot a lot of testing goes in to making sure your processor is ready to go for all of your gaming or workstation needs. It would be rare for a transistor to die, it probably wouldn’t affect you much though unless it was a very very critical part, and it could take a long time for that dead transistor to mess up your computer.

Short answer: yes but actually no (but mostly no) Long answer: they wouldn't work for the reasons expected.

The beak was full of strong smelling herbs and the the entire garb was waxed to prevent bodily fluids from seaping through. Obviously the miasma theory isn't true, but the masks *were* a physical and water resistant barrier so they did *something* to prevent spread of disease to the ""doctor"" from fluids. It should be added; however, that the bubonic plague that caused the black death is largely believed to be transmitted by fleas, but (as several people have let me know in replies) the later plague outbreaks when the plague doctor garb was actually used were mostly transmitted through the air and fluids.

It is later implied that she would have died from this contact if not for the fetus ""absorbing"" the radiation and dying immediately after birth. **Is actual radiation contamination *that* contagious?** [This article](https://www.livescience.com/13444-radiation-exposure-contagious.html) seems to indicate that it's nearly impossible to deliver radiation via skin-to-skin contact, and that as long as a sick person washes their skin and clothes, they're safe to be around, even if they've inhaled or ingested radioactive material that is still in their bodies. Is Chernobyl's portrayal of person-to-person radiation contamination *that* sensationalized? For as much as people talk about the show's historical accuracy, it's weird to think that the writers would have dropped the ball when it comes to understanding how radiation exposure works.","Radiation isn't ""contagious"" so much as you just have to keep in mind that radioactive material is constantly giving off radiation. At Chernobyl, that material was everywhere- not only on the ground in huge chunks, but also in the air, in fumes, ash, and dust. &#x200B; The firefighters who responded were covered in this material when they arrived at the hospital. It's why it was critical to remove their uniforms and store them in the basement where they are still radioactive today. I don't know if the time it took for a nurse to carry them downstairs would have been enough time to give the ""sunburn"" effect on her hand, but they're still moderately dangerous today, and would have been much more so at the time. &#x200B; The other thing to remember is that radioactive material can become trapped in the body. Those firefighters weren't just covered with the ash and dust, (which can mostly be removed with a shower and change of clothes), they breathed it in as well, where it gathered in their lungs and blood and ate them apart from the inside. The gamma rays emitted by those internal particles would have shot right through them and hit anything around them, making their bodies minorly radioactive. &#x200B; This is played up *slightly* on the show. While the radioactivity they admitted would be an issue, the main reason for keeping the patients separated from visitors is that your immune system is one of the first things to go from radioactivity, and so any visitors could pass on all manner of diseases to them.",9110

cf0o48,"Couldn't South have just as easily been chosen to be ""up"", and all maps and globes have the South pole on top?","This is a historical question, as Nowhere_Man_Forever points out. Generally, map makers oriented their maps towards what they thought was important. For example, some early maps were oriented east-west to aid navigation against the rising and setting sun. Later, North American explorers would make east-west oriented maps because those are the primary directions they traveled.  But, people since antiquity have thought that the Earth rotated and knew that pole stars (i.e. the North Star for us today) would maintain an apparent fixed position in the night sky. This imparted special navigational importance to the north-south axis. Then, when the magnetic compass was invented that solidified the north-south axis as the primary axis for navigation. Since it makes a lot of technical sense to have all your maps use the same orientation, the north-south axis was the only orientation that made sense.  There's not a clear technical reason to use north=top instead of south=top. One theory is that at the time of the explorers there was no comparable pole star in the southern hemisphere like there is Polaris (which is exceptionally bright) in the northern hemisphere. However, that's a pretty weak theory. It's probably just the case that the Europeans wanted to put Europe at the top of their maps, and their maps would end up having the largest sway over the future events to come. The other great powers in the world at the time didn't do as much exploration and weren't as imperial as the Europeans were, so their maps are the ones that stuck.",2119

So I'd like to point out a different issue with severe dehydration. As the body becomes increasingly dehydrated, it becomes increasingly difficult to actually get water in.  This is especially true when you consider one of the most common causes of dehydration is fluid loss due to GI illness. (vomiting and diarrhea). This is even doubly so with infants. It's not possible to rehydrate simply by drinking. You cause more vomiting, more loss, and risk aspirating and drowning. And with dehydration comes hypovolemia. There's so little volume of blood in your veins that they are virtually impossible to start an IV without blowing the vessel.

There is a large group of researchers as part of the [ENIGMA](http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/) study to try to tease this out. The issue is that there is tremendous variation between normal people so abnormalities are not specific to people with mental illness. Additionally, similar to pain, mental illness is literally ""all in your head."" You can't objectively measure pain, sadness, and suicidal ideation with the techniques we have right now; I doubt we ever well. For example, what is an acceptable level of apathy? That may differ tremendously between people based on their jobs, family lives, culture, and general life views. That's why we have psychiatrists, to tease these issues out and adjust the plan appropriately.

cyi0rj,"Edit: Thank you, anonymous do-gooder for the gold! They say it is better to give than to receive, but this is my first gold so I gotta say this feels pretty darn good!","I am writing a PhD thesis on the ocean response to tropical cyclones. Contrary to what some people have suggested here, the energy of cyclone (hurricane) winds powers ocean currents well over 100 meters below the ocean surface. This has been observed directly using autonomous ocean profilers that measure temperature, salinity and velocity at different depths: https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/2010JPO4313.1 Now, the answer to your question varies according to what you consider ""deep sea."" However, a particular process does come to mind that can reach down hundreds of meters deep and impact marine organisms: hurricanes power vertical currents that lift up water towards the surface.  If a hurricane's eye moves slowly (say 1m/s), water may be sucked up from 150 meters deep all the way up to the surface ([source]{https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/2009MWR2863.1}).  However, if the hurricane moves much faster, it will create a large underwater wave: deep, cold water will be carried up and down by as much as 80 m and with a regular frequency in time. These are called near-inertial internal waves (NIWs) and they are an effect of the Earth's rotation. Across the global ocean, these waves help transport energy from the ocean surface towards deeper regions and thus play a role in shaping climate. Now... These effects are mostly localized along the hurricane track, and are likely to be very weak to the sides of the track. This explains why a submarine could navigate ""below"" a hurricane and not have much trouble. However, a submarine navigating right below a hurricane eye is about to get into A LOT of trouble, as it's going to lose (to some extent) the ability to control its depth.",5353
d31uje,"EDIT: There's a lot of angry responses to my question that are getting removed. I just want to note that I'm not asking if you can jump a car with a cell phone (obviously no). I'm just asking if a cell phone battery holds the amount of energy required by a car to start. In other words, if you had the tools available, could you trickle charge you car's dead battery enough from a cell phone's battery. Thanks /u/NeuroBill for understanding the spirit of the question and the thorough answer.","Most phones have about a  3000mAh battery, Those charges are energized up 3.6 volts (give or take), which means the battery can supply 10.8 Watt hours. See as a Watt is Joules per second, and there are 3600 seconds per hour 10.8 joules/second \* hours  \* (3600 seconds/hour) = 38,880 Joules of energy. Lets just call it 38 kJ of energy. &#x200B; So, how much energy does it take to start a car? Lets say you're car is nice and new, so you might need to run the starter motor for half a second.  Your battery should be charge to 12.6 volts. But how much current will the starter draw? A hell of a lot is the answer. The inrush current to a starter motor might be 700 amps, and then settle to about 200 amps. But lets average it out at 400 Amps for half a second, at 12.6 volts. So 12.6 volts \* 400 Amps = 5 kW, for half a second is 2.5 kJ. Really? I'm shocked by that. So it seems your cellphone battery does have enough energy. However, you couldn't do it directly. Different batteries have different ""C"" ratings, which decide how much current they can pass without risking blowing up, and I expect the C rating on cell phone batteries is quite low. Which is to say, the cell phone battery can't supply the 200-700 Amps you need to spin the motor. Furthermore, and more fundamentally, your cellphone battery is too low a voltage to get the motor moving. So you would need to have a circuit that probably was composed of a DC/DC converter, that boosts the voltage of your phone battery, and then 6 or so super capacitors to store the energy that your phone battery trickle into them. I reckon your phone battery can probably supply about 1 amp of current max, \[totally guessing that number\] at 3.6 volts, which is 3.6 watts, or 3.6 joules per second. So in order to charge up this hypothetical device to 2.5 kJ of energy it would take 700 seconds, or 11 minutes.  Give or take. And this is all assuming your car starts in half a second, and 100% efficiency. In reality, it might take a good second or two, and you'd be lucky to get 80% efficient. In which case it might take over an hour.    So, TLDR: Most modern cell phone batteries have enough energy to start a typical car motor, certainly at least a couple times, but they can't supply enough current at a high enough voltage to do it. You might be able to build a device that could allow your cellphone battery to start your car, but it would take a bare minimum of 11 minutes, and perhaps as long as an hour, for your phone battery to charge the device.",9043

davjoi,You'd think 5+GHz CPUs would be everywhere by now.,"tl;dr increasing CPU frequency is kind of like increasing RPMs on a car engine - it's one unit of how much power a car's engine is producing, but it's not so good for comparing multiple types of cars in terms of how fast they can go or how much they can tow.  If one person is driving a Toyota Corolla at 2000 RPM and another is driving a Ford F150 at 2000 RPM, that tells you very little about which is carrying more weight (IPC\*) or going faster (CPU benchmarks) or has more room (cache?\*). You can push a car's RPMs higher to go faster, but then you produce **more heat** and it's harder on the engine; generally, there'll be a range of RPMs where it's most efficient and is designed to run stably - *frequencies are largely the same sort of thing.* You can think of CPUs as having basically five metrics that improve performance: 1. Manufacturing tech - how small can pieces of the CPU be built? 2. CPU Frequency - number of times the core clock 'ticks' per second.  3, 4 GHz, etc. 3. CPU Instructions Per Clock (IPC\*) - number of instructions the CPU can execute during a core clock cycle 4. CPU memory\* cache/cache speed - amount and speed of memory that the CPU can use to store instructions/results 5. Design/layout of the chip itself The implication being: 1. Make the manufacturing tech smaller and everything else constant = lower power requirements, less heat, faster on/off switching of transistors 2. Make the CPU frequency faster = more power requirements, less stability 3. Make the IPC higher = faster (more work done) at the same CPU frequency 4. More memory/faster memory speed = real-world improvements irrespective of CPU frequency 5. Design/layout = real-world improvements in cost, etc A 4 GHz CPU in 2019 is actually much faster than a 4 GHz CPU in 2009, because the IPC (roughly the amount of work that gets done per Hz) is higher.  The 2019 CPU would also use much less power per calculation than the 2009 CPU, because the manufacturing tech is much smaller.  And it would feel faster because more of the work can be loaded into very fast memory very close to the actual CPU cores (instead of running back-and-forth to RAM). Basically, they discovered about 10 years ago that they were hitting diminishing returns on increasing CPU core  clock speed.  So they looked to other areas where they could improve efficiency and/or speed: more cores, better cores (higher IPC), more on-chip memory, smaller tech = less power draw, etc. For a real example: In 2008, a Pentium 4 at 2.8GHz had a per-thread PassMark score of 633; in 2017, an i9-7960X at 2.8 GHz had a per-thread passMark score of 2337.  Same frequency, drastically different amount of work getting done.",5500
dbxuup,"I've always wondered, in stereotypical deserts with plentiful sand dunes, how deep does the sand go? And what's under the sand? Water? Dirt? Stone?","I'm going to focus on the Sahara, because that lets me crib from [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/93y26g/what_is_the_bottom_of_the_sahara_desert_like_like/e3hb54u/) I made a year ago. You can apply this same stuff to any desert, though! First, I'm required to point out that deserts like the Sahara, contrary to popular belief, are mostly *not* covered in sand dunes. [Here's a map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Saharan_topographic_elements_map.png) of all the dune fields (in yellow) in the Sahara. Most of the Sahara looks something like [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Algeria_desert_park.JPG)- a rock-strewn sandy soil with a hard crust (""desert pavement""), like what you see in the Mars rover photos but with scattered bushes. The dunes covered places that look like that, so imagine a rocky soil a few meters thick at the bottom of the dunes. Then the groundwater level is usually somewhere above the old ground level, so imagine that it's soaking wet and muddy. That's what it's like down there. The dunes are not like glaciers- they don't rub rock formations smooth once they're buried. They mostly preserve it whole. (For an extreme example of this, see the [camel thorn trees of Namibia](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-of-the-day/2011/5/camel-thorn-trees-namibia/) which were buried centuries ago and only recently uncovered as the dune kept migrating.) Another thing to consider is where all that sand came from. You get sand dunes when the environment is producing more new sand grains faster than it can stabilize them into rock. The Sahara has so many dune fields because when the climate was wetter about 6000-10000 years ago, there were massive lakes covering what is now desert. When these lakes dried up, their sandy bottoms provided an ample source of sand to make dunes (and an ample source of nutrients in the form of wind blown dust to feed [the Amazon rainforest](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-satellite-reveals-how-much-saharan-dust-feeds-amazon-s-plants/)). [Here's a map](https://imgur.com/a/EJ45gPx) (snipped from [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258066270_Dynamics_of_Green_Sahara_Periods_and_Their_Role_in_Hominin_Evolution)) of all the huge lakes and alluvial fans (in blue and gray) that used to cover the Sahara. Notice how many of them are in the same parts of the desert that now have dune fields in that earlier image? In many places, the current dunes are directly over the old lake bed, so the bottom of the dunes is exactly what you would imagine a dried up lake to be like. See [this radar image](https://imgur.com/a/0fHqobo) from [an earlier askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1xjnz0/if_all_the_sand_in_the_saharan_desert_were_to_be/) question.

f1r275,"the scene where they visit the waterworld-esque planet and suffer time dilation has been bugging me for a while. the gravitational field is so dense that there was a time dilation of more than two decades, shouldn't the planet have been pulled into the blackhole? i am not being critical, i just want to know.","They mention explicitly at one point that the black hole is close to maximally rotating, which changes the stability of orbits. For a non-rotating black hole, you're right, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is 3 times the event horizon. The higher the spin of the black hole, though, the more space-time is dragged around with the spin, and you can get a bit of a boost by orbiting in the same direction as the spin. This frame-dragging effect lets you get a bit closer to the event horizon in a stable orbit. For a black hole with the maximum possible spin, ISCO goes right down to the event horizon. By studying the material falling into the black hole and carefully modelling the light it emits, it's even possible to back out an estimate of the black hole's spin, and this has been done for a number of black holes both in our galaxy and out. For those curious about the spin, ISCO, or black hole accretion geometry more generally, [Chris Reynolds has a review of spin measures of black holes](http://www.astro.umd.edu/~chris/Significant_publications_for_Christopher_Reynolds_files/Reynolds2013.pdf) that's reasonably accessible (in that you can skip the math portions and still learn some things, particularly in the introduction).  They also mention at one point that the black hole is super-massive, which makes it physically quite large since the radius is proportional to mass. This has the effect of *weakening* the tidal forces at the point just outside the event horizon. While smaller black holes shred infalling things through their tides (called ""spaghettification"" since things are pulled into long strands - no really), larger black holes are actually safer for smaller objects to approach. Though things as big as stars still get disrupted and pulled apart, and we have actually seen that happen in other galaxies!  So for a black hole that's massive enough and has a high enough spin, it would be possible to have an in-tact planet in a stable orbit near the event horizon. Such a planet would not, however, be particularly hospitable to the continued existence of any would-be explorers, from radiation even if nothing else.",8567
f2wzdd,"I understand that this might border on violating Rule #1, but I am not seeking medical advice. I  am merely curious about the effects on the body.  There are lots of ways you could raise your temperature a little (or a lot if you’re not careful), such as showers, baths, hot tubs, steam rooms, saunas, etc...  My understanding is that a fever helps fight infection by acting in two ways. The higher temperature inhibits the bug’s ability to reproduce in the body, and it also makes some cells in our immune system more effective at fighting the infection.  So, would basically giving yourself a fever, or increasing it if it were a very low grade fever, help?","There's a lot of speculation in the comments, and a lot of the information in the comments is outright wrong/dangerous. Please don't take medical advice from any of these comments... In short, pathogens cause the release of cytokines, which are inflammatory modulators that in a broad sense do various things to help fight infection. Some of these cytokines are pyrogenic (IL-1, IL-6, TNF, IFN). These act in many ways, but one of them is acting at the level of the hypothalamus to raise the body's 'set point' temperature via PGE2, similar to how a normal thermostat works. This causes a number of physiologic changes eg. you vasoconstrict in the periphery (so your limbs feel cold), and we're behaviourally programmed to decrease exposed surfaces - wearing more clothes, getting inside, reducing activity. You might also shiver. Fever generally makes us feel terrible because of the above. It also increases baseline O2 consumption, can induce mental changes, and it can also exacerbate cardiac or pulmonary disease.  There is evidence that an elevated (febrile) temperature in animal cells IN TEST TUBES is beneficial, via a heightened immune response and increased bacteriacidal killing (PMID 12015457). HOWEVER there are no studies showing that fever itself facilitates any faster recovery from illness or adjuvants the immune system. There is isolated evidence in the context of influenza vaccination that treatment with antipyretics can actually boost anti-influenza antibody levels (PMID 7746030). We're pretty sure that treating fever symptoms with antipyretics does no harm and also doesn't slow recovery.  Exogenous heat exposure/production in an uncontrolled fashion can override the body's ability to lose heat and cause dangerously high (read: you could die) internal temperatures (ie. heat stroke). The thing we worry most about in the context of the acute illnesses that we're talking about from a temperature perspective is high fever, because we know that this results in bad things happening (some mentioned above) - and potentially seizure, coma, death.  Our bodies are well-oiled machines, and for the most part, your body knows what it's doing. Don't go messing around with trying to increase your body temperature on your own, because that is perhaps the most dangerous thing you can do.  tl;dr - We don't really have evidence that tells us whether temperature alone changes how the body manages infections. We know for a fact that artificially altering your body's temperature, particularly attempts to raise temperature, is dangerous. This is not medical advice, and if you want medical advice then you should go see a doctor. Edit: spelling and more pointed summary Edit 2: Thanks for the gilds!",4990
f5klom,In 5 billion years will we have any home in this solar system?,"While Saturn will be in the habitable zone and Titan along with it you have to think of how these worlds will be affected by the increase in temperature. The average density of Titan suggests it is a good mix of rock and ice, so with an increase in radiation from the sun, most of the methane will be lost to space and the ice might melt, but that much ice may mean a water world (covered in ocean). Titan is tidally locked to Saturn and orbits ~16days, so its days are ~16 Earth days. This would mean wild temperature variations between day/night sides. Also, Titan does not have its own magnetic field so maintaining an atmosphere is not promising. It does get some protection from Saturn’s mag field, but it also ventures outside of it and gets blasted by the solar wind.",3613
fappui,Do cats turn it on or is it a response to something? If it's a response then what exactly is telling the purring to activate and cease? What evolutionary benifit is purring believed to  grant?,"Purring primarily seems to be a communication method related to mother-kitten relationship. Especially when nursing, her kittens purring signals the mother that everything is alright. The evolutionary advantage of this is that even a newborn kitten can effectively communicate whether or not its receiving enough milk and is in good health. When adult cats purr by themselves, this is apparently simply a ""vestige"" of this nursing behaviour. Similarly, the mother purring most likely has a calming effect on the kittens. Think of it as a guitar string starting to vibrate when you strike the same string on a different instrument nearby. Cats also use purring for communication between adults. It might be advantageous as an effective communication of peaceful intent to avoid confrontation. (*Lastly, purring has beneficial effects on self-healing of tissue and bones.*)  Addendum: Upon further research, this doesn't seem as accepted as I thought. There are many articles about it ([Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/), [Spektrum](https://www.spektrum.de/frage/wie-und-warum-schnurren-katzen/1350610#) (DE), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180724-the-complicated-truth-about-a-cats-purr), to list a few) but many include the same one or two names, which always sets off alarm bells. Also, the only article in a scientific journal (?) I could find is [this one](http://www.animalvoice.com/catpurrP.htm), and I don't know what to think of it. One the one hand, it was published in the apparently respectable [Journal of the Acoustical Society of America](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.4777098) and, from quickly skimming it, it seems plausible and there is non-trivial evidence that vibration has beneficial effects on bone density. On the other hand, the study was original done by the [Fauna Communications Research Institute](http://www.animalvoice.com/), whose website alone makes me question their competence. [/addendum]   So purring is a *result* of being content but it can also *invoke* relaxation and is thus used passively when a cat is happy but also as an active form of communication. You can observe that if you own a cat. They don't just simply purr but have various different kinds of purring they use under different circumstances.",4739

R0=1 when an infected person infects one other person on average. This gets more complicated as more of the population is infected, so you might see Reff (effective R0) used instead. The CFR in Wuhan/Hubei province is about 4% but about 1% in the rest of China (according to the official statistics). The difference is likely due to treatment availability and the heads-up the rest of the country got. That’s compared to about 0.01% for seasonal flu, about 2.5% for Spanish flu and ~10% for MERS.  (EDIT: 10% for SARS, 20-60% for MERS, thanks for the correction.) R0 is normally about 1.3 for this kind of virus, however the long incubation time means the infection rate is probably higher here.

gcu1es,I have a B.S. in biology so I'm not looking for an explanation of how invasive species. I'm looking for more information on this particular invasive species and how it might impact an already threatened honey bee population.,"I’m an entomologist, here’s my two cents. Something to keep in mind is that while honey bees are important for people’s livelihoods and the current agricultural system, they are not native to North America and compete for many of the same pollen sources that native bees use. When talking about the bee crisis I find that most people really only think about the Eurasian honey bee (Apis mellifera), when the bigger threat is that native bees are suffering from huge declines. Honey bees are of significant economic importance as a livestock animal, and there are many people devoting their time and funds to working on maintaining the industry. The same effort and funds cannot be allocated to native pollinators to the same degree and that’s where the biggest threat is (in my opinion). It’s analogous to saying “We need to save birds!” and only thinking about chickens while sweeping native birds under the rug. That’s not to say that honey bees are unimportant, it’s just something I like to mention when discussing the current bee situation. As answered by others, the Asian Giant Hornet eats many different types of insects (not just bees) but can target honey bee hives when available. If Asian Giant Hornets can overpower a honey bee colony they get a huge food payout, so this is a favorable hunting strategy for the hornet. In Japan their native honey bee is Apis cerana, which is a different but closely related species to the Eurasian honey bee that we use in bee keeping in the US. Apis cerana has evolved a strategy to effectively protect their colonies against attacks from the Asian Giant Hornet. Eurasian honey bees have not developed a strategy for this hornet, and that leaves them very vulnerable to attacks by hungry Asian Giant Hornets.  The main issue is that the Asian Giant Hornet could pose a threat to the bee keeping industry in the region, not to mention it is a generally feared insect. Destructive invasive insects are nothing new — the emerald ash borer is an introduced insect that targets native ash trees and causes huge economic losses as just one example. However, the Asian Giant Hornet creates a pretty ideal storm for the media to capitalize on. It’s huge, people are generally scared of large stinging insects, and it attacks honey bees occasionally (the bee that the general public tends to think of as the main target for preservation). It also threatens a region’s bee keeping industry and could have a negative effect on people’s livelihoods if people don’t take protective measures against it.  EDIT: I am editing to emphasize and clarify my point here, it could have some negative effects in the region IF it is not effectively monitored and controlled. The Asian Giant Hornet was first sighted in September of 2019 (on Vancouver Island), and has been carefully monitored since then. That colony was exterminated when it was found. Scientists are keeping a close eye on this and are serious about eradicating any remaining Asian Giant Hornets in the region. The current calls for action are preventative measures just to ensure that things are kept under control and that people are aware of them. There is no concrete evidence at this point that they are actually well established in the region. This is the time of year when queen hornets would emerge to establish a new hive. Scientists are seeking to eradicate any possible queens before they can successfully start new colonies.

gfaczm,So my son has high functioning autism and he is obsessed with tornados. He is 7 and constantly pesters his mom and myself with questions. I know the basics but I am hoping that the more knowledgeable of you can provide more correct answers that I can simplify for him. And any other super cool facts wold be super appreciated! Tornados: 1. How do tornadoes create a vortex? 1. How are their winds so strong? 1. How do tornadoes form their eye? 1. Is the center of the tornado the strongest part? 1. How do tornadoes crush items that it sucks up?,"This is actually right up my alley as I study atmospheric science and have even done some storm chasing myself. If your son hasn’t had the chance, I’d definitely recommend watching old TV shows like Storm Chasers from  the Discovery Channel or storm chaser videos that come out on YouTube after every big tornado event! Also the weather service has great resources such as [https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq/](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq/) with plenty of information. I've left out peer-reviewed sources since I don't imagine they're of much interest to a 7 year old. 1. When you see thunderstorms, you’re seeing rising air fueled with energy from water condensing into the cloud we see. The rising air is called and updraft, and the thunderstorm has to continually suck in air from the surrounding environment to fuel it. If the winds in the atmosphere change direction with height, this can cause the core of the storm to rotate – a rotating updraft is called a mesocyclone. Now the tricky part is we actually don’t have a complete theory for how these rotating updrafts form tornadoes – some do but most do not – and this is a topic of ongoing research! If we could figure this out, it would save many lives.   Tornadoes rotate because the storm rotates – it’s an extension of this updraft that reaches the surface. Most of the tornadoes we typically think of are produced by supercells, which are the strongest type of thunderstorm. These storms have towering cumulonimbus clouds, have a rotating updraft (mesocyclone), and are fueled by energy from the sun and water vapor and by strong winds in the atmosphere.Fun fact - a supercell's updraft can carry tornado debris to as high as 30 thousand feet, after which it can fall out hundreds of miles away. Seeing this debris on radar is one of the main ways scientists such as those at the National Weather Service can 'see' a tornado without actually being near the storm and warn the public. The height debris reaches is correlated very well with tornado strength and the strength of the thunderstorm updraft. 2. The winds in tornadoes are so strong because the winds in thunderstorms are so strong! The speed of the updraft in a supercell can exceed 40 m (130 feet) per second, and air is drawn in rapidly to replace air that has risen. As air is drawn  into a tornado and rotates around it, it speeds up much like an ice skater drawing their arms to spin faster. This is because of conservation of angular momentum. A tornado is basically a tiny low-pressure system (like a hurricane or your sink draining) and the winds increase toward the center similarly.Fun fact - we see clouds in tornadoes (called the condensation funnel) because the pressure decreases and water vapor condenses inside the vortex, but the tornado is bigger than the cloud, and a condensation funnel is not necessary for a tornado to exist and do damage. 3. Tornadoes are not thought to have ‘eyes’ in the same way hurricanes do, but the wind speed at the center is 0. If you looked at a cross section of a tornado (see the link in 4), the wind profile in a tornado increases as you move towards the center  –  but it can’t go up forever! Near the center, it turns back towards 0 before increasing again on the other side. Any vortex has a calm center like this! 4. In some ways yes. The area near the center has the fastest winds, though the center itself has the weakest wins. Observed wind profiles from real tornadoes such as [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610517301174#fig6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610517301174#fig6) show this pattern.Typically however, being in the center of a tornadoes path *is* the worst place to be. As a tornado moves, the areas in the center of its path will spend the longest time inside, will experience the strongest winds twice, and will endure a complete 180 degree turnaround in violent winds. This does a lot of damage! 5. Things damaged by a tornado typically are damaged by other things inside a tornado more than they are by the winds themselves. Most of the damage you see when a tornado hits trees or buildings is from debris picked up by the tornado and hurled around! This is actually a reasonably large issue in determining tornado strength. We rate tornadoes using the EF scale, from the weakest EF-0, to the strongest EF-5, but ratings are given based on damage caused. The widest tornado ever recorded, the El Reno, OK tornado in 2013, was a staggering 2.6 miles wide and is often thought to be an EF-5. Researchers nearby recorded nearly 300 mph winds (EF-5 strength) inside the tornado using radar, but since we officially assess tornado strength by damage caused and the El Reno tornado was primarily in open fields, it ended up with only an EF-3 rating. I hope this helps, I'd be happy to elaborate or answer more questions!",4832
gh2c1d,"Given the hilarious quarantine haircut pictures floating around, it got me thinking. Hairstyling demonstrates relatively sophisticated tool use, even if it's just using a sharp rock.

Styles like mudding of the hair, or ""dredding"" of the hair, that we still see in African tribal cultures don't require tools, and are likely some of the earliest ""styling"" technologies, though I'm not sure there's much evidence to back up that claim.   Braids and rope are essentially the same technology; they don't require tools although combs make them easier.  I can imagine them developing before carved or constructed combs, since the human hand can suffice as a rudimentary comb, as could an antler.  We have debatable evidence of braids from about 30,000 years ago, in Austria, with the [Venus of Willendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Willendorf) and about 25,000 years ago with the [Venus of Brassempouy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Brassempouy)  But early hominids would be mostly if not completely gone by this time, making extrapolation difficult.

It wouldn't require additional tool development beyond  fire-making, and could have been used by early hominids with the tech for carrying fire. Shaving and hair cutting could have come with just the simplest stone tools, near the very beginning of tool use in hominids.  But it's difficult to attribute.  Even the [Châtelperronian industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Châtelperronian) is still controversial, though we do have some evidence that the tools and body ornamentation happening there was related to Neanderthals. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160920090400.htm We have unearthed fairly sophisticated hair combs in Africa around 5000 BCE, and can probably push their development back a bit in time, but how distant would be a guess. A lot of information we have about early homind lifestyle is happening with chemical analysis of food proteins left on teeth, pollen analysis, and something called [Peptide Mass Fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_mass_fingerprinting) for rapid detection of hominid remains.  It's teaching us a hell of a lot about neaderthals.  But it's really deep analysis of such ephemeral residues, there remain limits to our reach into the past.",3783

gtxk7d,"It's well known that you can fairly easily read English when the letters are jumbled up, as long as the first and last letters are in the right place. But does this also work in languages that don't use true alphabets, like abjads (Arabic), syllabaries (Japanese and Korean) and logographs (Chinese and Japanese)?","It depends on what is the equivalent you are thinking of for Chinese. Since in English the letters are scrambled, the most direct equivalent would be swapping the positions of strokes around within a character.  I would say in general this produces completely gibberish characters that are near impossible to decipher. For English you basically just need to mentally shift alphabets left and right to decipher a jumbled up word, but in Chinese the strokes can move ""360 degrees"" within a character so the permutations are endless. Take a common character like 我 (wo), which means ""me"" or ""I"". Maybe some slight shifting of the strokes is ok, but swapping the strokes around creates mutant characters that literally don't exist in the Chinese dictionary and would be unpronounceable and have no meaning.",5327
gvc7k9,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change.  When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black. When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care. These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression.  Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM.  However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown. These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics. This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia. It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.  ----- **Sources:** - https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793 - https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/ - https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/racial-disparities-time-of-covid-19 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK24693/ - https://www.joincampaignzero.org/research - https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/black-workers-coronavirus-covid-19 - https://www.npr.org/transcripts/867466515 - https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/diversity-in-the-stem-workforce-varies-widely-across-jobs/ - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0519-z - https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20190529a/full/ - https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/11/even-progressive-academics-can-be-racist-ive-experienced-it-firsthand/ - http://www.bu.edu/articles/2017/lgbt-issues-stem-diversity/","I’m curious what the numbers would look like if you factored in socioeconomic status.

gzb3gy," I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions: 1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue. 2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories? 3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally? Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested: 2020: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/health-51182451 2019: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190604084838.htm 2017: https://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/4895010/cancers-newest-miracle-cure/%3famp=true 2014: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140325102705.htm 2013: https://www.cancerresearch.org/blog/december-2013/cancer-immunotherapy-named-2013-breakthrough-of-the-year 2009: http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/12/17/cancer.research.breakthrough.genetic/index.html TL;DR  Why do we see stories about breakthroughs in cancer research? How can we know what to be legitimately excited about? Why haven’t we found a universal treatment or cure yet?","Several things. There HAVE been many advances in cancer prevention, detection and treatment. (Though obviously there is tremendous work yet to be done.) Often, new treatment technologies, while genuinely promising, fail to fully live up to that initial promise. Pop science and medical news reporting often exaggerates or overstates the potential of emerging technologies. Even responsible journalism is often sensationalized to bolster reader interest. Finally, there are MANY different forms of cancer with wildly different causes, characteristics and disease processes. It is pretty unlikely that we will ever see any single ""cure"" for all types of cancers.",6544
hajbhy,"Back in the mid 90s when the WWW started, a 16 MB machine was sufficient to run Netscape or Mosaic.  Now, it seems that even 2 GB is not enough.  What is taking all of that space?","The World-Wide-Web was first invented in 1989.  Naturally, back then having a computer on your desk with RAM in the gigabyte range was completely unheard of.  The earliest versions of the web had only very simple formatting options -- you could have paragraphs, headings, lists, bold text, italic text, underlined text, block quotes, links, anchors, plaintext, citations, and of course plain text -- and that was about it.  It was more concerned with categorizing the data inside the document, rather than how it would be viewed and consumed^0.  If you're keen eyed, you might notice that I didn't list images -- these weren't supported in the initial version of the _HyperText Markup Language_ (HTML), the original language of the Web. By the mid 1990s, HTML 2.0 was formally standardized (the first formally standardized version of HTML).  This added images to the standard, along with tables, client side image maps, internationalization, and a few other features^1.  Up until this time, rendering of a website was fairly simple:  you parsed the HTML document into a document tree, laid out the text, did some simple text attributes, put in some images, and that was about it.  But as the Web became more commercialized, and as organizations wanted to start using it more as a development platform for applications, it was extended in ways the original design didn't foresee. In 1997, HTML 4 was standardized.  An important part of this standard was that it would work in conjunction with a new standard syntax, known as _Cascading Style Sheets_ (CSS).  The intent here was that HTML would continue to contain the document data and the metadata associated with that data, but not how it was intended to be laid out and displayed, whereas CSS would handle the layout and display rules.  Prior to CSS, there were proprietary tag attributes that would denote things like text size or colour or placement inside the HTML -- CSS changed this so you could do this _outside_ of the HTML.  This was considered a good thing at the time, as you could (conceptually at least) re-style your website without having to modify the data contained within the website -- the data and the rendering information were effectively separate.  You didn't have to find every link to change its highlight colour from blue to red -- you could just change the style rule for anchors. But this complexity comes at a cost -- you need more memory to store and apply and render your documents, especially as the styling gets more and more complex. And if that were only the end of things!  Also in 1997, Netscape's Javascript was standardized as ECMAScript.  So on top of having HTML for document data, and CSS for styling that data, a browser now also had to be capable of running a full language runtime. Things have only continued to get more complicated since.  A modern web browser has support for threads, graphics (WebGL), handling XML documents, audio and video playback^2, WebAssembly, MathML, _Session Initiation Protocol_ (typically used for audio and video chat features), WebDAV (for remote disk access over the web), and piles upon piles of other standards.  A typical web browser is more akin to an Operating System these days than a document viewer. But there is more to it than that as well.  With this massive proliferation of standards, we also have a massive proliferation of developers trying to maximize the use of these standards.  Websites today may have extremely complex layering of video, graphics, and text, with animations and background Javascript processing that chews through client RAM.  Browser developers do a valiant effort to try to keep the resource use down to a minimum, but with more complex websites that do more you can't help but to chew through RAM.  FWIW, as I type this into ""new"" Reddit, the process running to render and display the site (as well as to let me type in text) is using 437.4MB of RAM.  That's _insane_ for what amounts to less than three printed pages of text with some markup applied and a small number of graphics.  But the render tree has hundreds of elements^3, and it takes a lot of RAM to store all of those details, along with the memory backing store for the rendered webpage for display.  Simpler websites use less memory^4, more complex websites will use gobs more.   So in the end, it's due to the intersection of the web adopting more and more standards over time, making browsers much more complex pieces of software, while simultaneously website designers are creating more complex websites that take advantage of all the new features.  HTH! ----- ^0 -- In fact, an early consideration for HTML was that the client could effectively render it however it wanted to.  Consideration was given to screen reading software or use with people with vision impairment, for example.  The client and user could effectively be in control of how the information was to be presented.   ^1 -- Several of these new features were already present in both the NCSA Mosaic browser and Netscape Navigator, and were added to the standard retroactively to make those extensions official.   ^2 -- until HTML 5 it was standard for your web browser to rely on external audio/video players to handle video playback via plug-ins (RealPlayer being one of the earliest such offerings).  Now this is built into the browser itself.  On the plus side, video playback is much more standardized and browsers can be more fully in control of playback.  The downside is, of course, the browser is more complex, and requires even more memory for pages with video.   ^3 -- Safari's Debug mode has a window that will show me the full render tree, however it's not possible to get a count, and you can't even copy-and-paste the tree elsewhere (that I can find) to get a count that way.  The list is at least a dozen or more pages long.   ^4 -- [example.com](http://www.example.com) only uses about 22MB of memory to render, for example.",7114
hco00a,"Basically, if an organ transplant recipient dies, can the transplanted organ be used by a third person?","The conditions for it to happen are extremely rare. First, the organ suffers in the transplant process , so to consider an already transplanted organ to be suitable for donation would be rare cause its probably accumulated some damage. It will depend on the organ tho. Liver or lungs or heart Id say its not worth the risk in most cases, and I have never seen it happen. You have to think that they are such big surgeries and cause scarring, making the surgery more difficult a second time, and patients in many cases are in an end stage of failure, that the new organ will also suffer some damage at a more increased rate than a normal organ. The other condition would have to be, a patient that received a transplant, that fits the conditions to be a donor, and that itself is low in probability.  The only ones I know that can happen are live donor kidney, cause they suffer very little, and are transplanted in an almost healthy recipient , so that kidney could be used again in a very special circumstance.",6679
hekhgw,"I'm linking the article I read from Reuters. I hope this isn't unacceptable. I'm simply curious whether this is a normal effect over time, or is something unique to Covid (if it's known). https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-antibody/antibody-levels-in-recovered-covid-19-patients-decline-quickly-research-","That’s not quite what the article ([Clinical and immunological assessment of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6)) said. It found that people who had been *asymptomatically infected* lost antibodies more quickly than those who showed symptoms. Importantly (and this will certainly be lost in the media reports) the majority of both groups (60% and ~90%) still had detectable antibodies at the 8 week mark.  First, there are several odd things about this article that make me a little skeptical. For one thing, this study also saw a drop in antibodies 8 weeks after symptomatic infection, whereas several larger studies have tracked symptomatic patients for at least this long and seen no such drop. For example, in [Dynamics of IgG seroconversion and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.20124636v2): “*Antibody responses do not decline during follow up almost to 2 months*”.  And “*In our survey, we did not find evidence for a decrease in IgG antibody titer levels on repeat sampling.*” ([Humoral immune response and prolonged PCR positivity in a cohort of 1343 SARS-CoV 2 patients in the New York City region](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085613v1.full.pdf+html)).  So those two studies, looking at nearly 500 patients, find no evidence for antibody decline, while this study, with just 37 patients, does find evidence. We can’t ignore it, but we can discount it and wait for more evidence.  Still, it’s entirely plausible that asymptomatic patients would have a weaker and less durable response than symptomatic. Inflammation drives immunity, so a less inflammatory disease would be expected to drive a less durable response. Again, we need to wait for larger, longer-lasting studies.  Is this typical of antibodies? Yes and no. Antibodies do fade away rapidly in the blood.  But with many, if not most, infections, new antibodies continue to be produced for months or years after the initial infection. That is, the B cells that produce the antibodies don’t immediately shut down or die, but keep on making more antibody, so that in many infections you can see antibodies present for a long time afterward.  With SARS and MERs, the closest cousins to SARS-CoV-2, the antibody response lasts for a reasonable but not extraordinary time. SARS antibodies have been shown to last for several years, with between 2 and 3 years being the most common claim ([Disappearance of Antibodies to SARS-Associated Coronavirus after Recovery](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc070348?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)) although one recent preprint claims “*IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years*” ([Long-Term Persistence of IgG Antibodies in SARS-CoV Infected Healthcare Workers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021386v1.full.pdf)).  MERS antibodies might last a little shorter, but that’s mainly because MERS patients haven’t been followed for as long, so a study that follows patients for a year can only claim “*Robust antibody responses were detected in all survivors who had severe disease; responses remained detectable, albeit with some waning, for <1 year.*” ([MERS-CoV Antibody Responses 1 Year after Symptom Onset, South Korea, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5512479/)).  So (1) several studies find that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stick around for a couple of months without fading, (2) SARS and MERS antibodies stick around for a year or three, but (3) one small study claims that asymptomatic patients have short-lived antibodies. This seems like a good time to say that more research is needed.",7846
hfd2zn,"Possibly a related question: Why is it that humans are able to produce offspring with ""fresh"" DNA, yet we are unable to maintain the integrity of our own DNA over time? Edit: Thank you, everybody for your very informative answers. TLDR: clones are essentially as normal as if they were naturally born. There is a very fine balance between healthy cell repair and cancer, and we haven't quite figured out how to control it reliably yet.",">Since DNA degrades as we age I want to clarify this point because it's not entirely accurate. DNA doesn't ""degrade"" in the sense of being broken down. As we age, cells have more time to accumulate harmful mutation either through errors in DNA replication or things like UV light exposure causing DNA bases to dimerize. DNA is maintained through an aptly names ""proofreading"" system. But more time and more cell replications increases the chances for errors because like any proofreader, this system isn't perfect. Another major aspect of this is telomere length. Telomeres are long repetitive sequences at the end of each chromosome. Think of them like the taped end of a shoelace - they're a protective end cap that prevents any damage at the ends from reaching the important information in the DNA. Telomeres shorten each time a cell replicates (just because of the mechanisms of how DNA replicates), unless they are re-elongated by telomerase. Telomeres have a critical point where, when they get too short they trigger cellular senesces. Basically a series of proteins are made that prevent the cell from replicating and it either sits there or dies (I mean, eventually it dies). This process is more likely to be responsible for short life in cloned organisms than the random mutation mentioned above.",376

hhmcld,"Edit: Apparently my phrasing was a little confusing. By one and done I meant ""generally"" you catch the virus like flu, and it's gone from your body in a couple weeks, as opposed to HIV which lasts your life and is constantly symptomatic. I did not mean that it's impossible to catch the flu again.","u/Cr4zyC47L4dy did a good job explaining! I just wanted to add a couple more points. HIV and herpes virus are very different viruses but both are thought to utilize your nervous system to evade detection by your immune system. Your central nervous system is considered ""immune privileged""\* in that your normal immune system can't access it. Neurons have limited capacity for regeneration so tightly controlling immune response and inflammation via limiting access to the CNS is important. This also allows for viruses like [HIV to maintain viral pools](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00440.x) that can reinfect the host if antiviral drugs are stopped. [Herpes infects your peripheral sensory neurons](https://uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-beyond-the-basics) and travels to the cell body in the dorsal root ganglia near your spine. There it remains dormant before reactivating (exact triggers are still debated), traveling down the dendrites and being released at the original site of infection. Because the virus is released so far from the cells which are producing it, the immune system never ends up being able to fully rid your body of the virus. Often people with chronic herpes infections will have a 'tingling' sensation before breaking out in sores. This has been attributed to the virus traveling down the sensory dendrites. Chicken pox is caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) which is in the herpes virus family. VZV can also infect sensory nerves and lay dormant in the dorsal root ganglia for years before reemerging as shingles. The characteristic distribution of shingles is in a band around half your torso (stopping at midline) which is due to the distribution of your sensory nerves. \*new [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_privilege#Central_nervous_system) suggests that the CNS isn't technically immune privileged as immune cells may enter through non-canonical methods. But the CNS remains less accessible to the immune system than most organs so it falls somewhere between immune privileged and ordinary ole organ.",10253

hpt7ab,"I'm very much a clueless layman, but I'm learning about genetics for the first time. I don't mean this in any sort of combative way–the Human Genome Project had countless benefits that we can't possibly track, and I'd imagine $2.7 billion is a trifle compared to its broader impact.  My question is just narrowly about the way that genome sequencing has dropped rapidly in cost. Was it fundamentally necessary to first use these exorbitantly pricey methods, which provided the foundation for the future research which would make it affordable? Or are the two questions inherently separate: the Human Genome Project gave us a first, initial glimpse at our mapped out genome, and then a decade later separate technological developments would make that same task much cheaper (as is commonly the case in science and technology). The ""could we have waited"" in the title is probably misleading–I really don't mean any sort of  value judgment (the project sounds enormously important), I purely mean ""could"" in a narrow hypothetical (not, ""would it have been a good idea to wait"", which I highly doubt).","The cost of gene sequencing has dropped dramatically, but these two numbers are apples and oranges. The Human Genome Project ""mapped the genome"". Meaning it created a ""reference genome"" that is roughly accurate for every human being on earth. It's like a scaffold upon which you can place any individual sequence you might read.  Today, you can take short reads of roughly a human genome-worth of DNA for less than $1000. That sequencing can tell you if the person has any small mutations. But without the reference genome, all that information would be worthless because you couldn't place all the little fragments of DNA where they sit on the larger genome. Think of it like having a big jumble of small phrases that you know belong in a big epic novel. Your job is to tell us what page the phrase belongs on. HGP pieced together the whole novel for the first time, so now your job is much easier because you can just do a CRTL+F.  Today, people continue to assemble new reference genomes (e.g., new species) and reassemble the human genome to look for larger variations that don't agree with the original reference genomes created by the HGP and others. You typically can't do that for <$1000. It could cost you tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on what tools you use and what accuracy you desire.  Tl;Dr: creating a new reference genome is much cheaper than it used to be and has certainly enabled by technology created in the course of the HGP and others. But still very very expensive.",7506
hsb5no,Edit: I'm most curious about propulsion. Thanks for the great answers everyone!,"You may be confusing *fuel* and *propellant*. Many spacecraft use nuclear fuel for their powerplants.

Here is a summary from [Atomic Rockets:](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/misconceptions.php#notpropellant) >In a rocket, there is a difference between ""fuel"" and ""reaction mass."" Rockets use Newton's third law of Action and Reaction in order to move. Mass is violently thrown away in the form of the rocket's exhaust and the reaction accelerates the rocket forward. This mass is of course the ""reaction mass."" It is sometimes also called ""remass"" or ""propellant.""   >   >The ""fuel"" is what is burned or whatever to generated the energy to expel the reaction mass.

This is the case with chemical rockets such as the Space Shuttle and the Saturn 5, which is how the misconception started in the first place.   >   >Automobiles, airplanes, and boats are sizable vehicles with relatively small fuel tanks. Not so rockets. An incredibly powerful rocket might approach having half its mass composed of reaction mass and the other half structure, hull plates, crew members, and everything else. But it is more likely that 75% of the mass will be reaction mass. Or worse. Most rockets are huge propellant tanks with a rocket engine stuck on the tail and a tiny crew habitat stuck on the top.",7256
hsrq9f,Was there an evolutionary advantage to having your right hand as your dominant?,"To add to the current answer a little bit and address the question in your title, the majority of the world is right-handed due to genetics with some influence of culture. There is a lot of really interesting research out there trying to predict hand dominance early in life. Some people have done studies where the data suggests the direction a newborns head prefers to flop indicates their preferred hand during childhood suggesting that hand preference is something that is born into us. There are theories suggesting there is a single gene we have not identified with one of the more well known ones being the [Right Shift Theory](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00829-000). The short explanation of this theory is there is a dominant gene that shifts development towards a left-hemisphere dominant development of language that also shifts our handedness to prefer using our right hand. Most of these theories suggest that we have this gene that shifts us to right hand dominance, but if someone does not inherit the right shift gene then it becomes a 50/50 chance of developing right and left hand dominance which matches up with 10-15 percent of the population being left hand dominant. [Other researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3931166/) argue the genetics of handedness are not that simple though since we have not been able to identify a single gene that determines your handedness and instead most theories of handedness and genetics believe it is influenced by multiple genes. We also know that genetics are not the only explanation for handedness due to differences we see across countries, which you can see here on the [infographic of rates of left-handedness by people by country](https://leftyfretz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/left-handed-percentage-by-country.png). There is also variation within countries as seen by [this map of the US](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RNVNMBK3V47A3EJ64V2QLMFBYQ.png) created by the Washington Post. So there is likely some cultural influence on whether someone will be right-hand dominant on top of the genetic components. The why of right hand dominance is probably the hardest part of the question to answer since giving a definitive answer for why evolution resulted in certain aspects of humans is very difficult. It likely has to do with the specialization of our hemispheres or slight changes in the brain structure in some way, however, hand preference is not exclusive to humans. For example, [baboons show a strong right hand dominance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432806001707). Researchers have also found [paw-preferences in cats and dogs](https://doi.org/10.1080/1357650X.2019.1578228), although they are no necessarily biased towards the right side like primates. The animal research tends to point towards lateralization of the brain leading towards hand preference, but I can't say I know all of this particular section of research well enough to make a definitive conclusion about that.",2144

i29bhr,"For example Dolly, or that extinct Ibex goat that we tried bringing back. Why did they die so quickly?","Hmm, most clones don't make it until birth, and there are numerous explanations, largely depending on how the cloning was undertaken. Typically, as with your examples, a process called [somatic cell nuclear transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell_nuclear_transfer) is undertaken. In short, cells are taken from adult animal, the nucleus containing the DNA is carefully scooped out, is then inserted into egg cells, which are finally induced to develop. The trouble is, the DNA you're inserting has already aged, often considerably. Take DNA from a 12-year old sheep and insert it into a sheep egg and you can be said to have a '12-year old sheep egg'. The years only continue piling on after that. To get into the details, there are two major influencing factors (amongst others): **i) Epigenetics:** We're all reasonably familiar with the basics of DNA. A DNA sequence represents a string of 'letters', or nucleotides, which encodes information - information used by cellular machinery to make stuff. Simple enough. However, on top of this genetic code there lies a secondary layer of annotation, which helps inform the cell when/where/why etc. to use the genetic instructions. This is the epigenetic code. Think of it a bit like a Word document; the main body of text is your genetic code, and let's say this doesn't really change. [Epigenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics) is akin to someone reviewing your document, and writing comments, corrections, annotations on the side. And this higher level of annotation changes considerably throughout your lifespan; arguments going back and forth between different reviewers, suggestions written then hastily scribbled out, bits of text highlighted in different colours. A big ol' mess you now have to untangle. A developing embryo reading this annotation is going to struggle interpreting how it should proceed with understanding the main body of the text. It will do some things a bit early, it will do things a bit late, it might not do some things at all. Extremely few cloned individuals make it to birth for this reason, and those that do often continue to express problematic phenomena such as gene dysregulation, over- or under-expression etc. etc. ever after. This 'aint no recipe for a healthy animal. **ii) Telomeres:** DNA in cells is typically organised into structures called chromosomes. I mentioned above DNA sequences encode information? Well, that's not *quite* true. Only a small fraction of your DNA actually does - the rest can have a whole buncha' other 'non-coding' functions. At the end of your chromosomes, you have a section of some of this non-coding DNA called a [**telomere**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere). The purpose of this telomere is to act as a buffer during DNA replication, which happens every time your cell divides, in order to protect the rest of your DNA, including all the coding regions, from accidentally being chopped off. Every time your cell divides, a little bit of this telomere is removed instead, until eventually they no longer remain and your cell divisions could start cutting into important coding regions. This is bad. Embryonic stem cells are capable of preventing this telomere degradation. So, y'know, normal embryos start development with a lovely long pair of telomeres. In a cloned individual, they can often start development with a severely shortened set; and they'll only be getting shorter. As such, many young cloned animals are disproportionately more likely to suffer premature cell line quiescence or self-destruction. As with a dodgy epigenome, this 'aint exactly great for their health either. ____ More recent advances in cloning technology have meant we can better deal with the above considerations, and we've successfully and sequentially cloned, for example, several generations of mice without any telomere length loss. It tentatively looks like it kinda' depends on which tissue you got your original sample from. Likewise several epigenetic barriers that impede cloning processes are in the process of being overcome. Cloning is slowly but surely becoming increasingly viable. Maybe we can try again with the [Pyrenean ibex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenean_ibex), who knows? ____  ^**References:**  [^(Bugstaller, J.P. & Brem, G.

ia2q5r,Edit: I am clinically depressed and was curious,"Clinical psychologist with a lot of background in depression. Most people’s answers here are on the money, in that IQ holds true but more about symptoms. But let’s move past that part because IQ is a really hard concept to grasp without knowing the background. Don’t worry about IQ, as it’s a relatively a useless thing unless we talk about functioning capabilities. Basically, if you can follow instructions on a lego set and remember a phone number, you’re as “smart” as everybody else and that’s all you need to worry about.  Depression won’t make you less “smart” but how you feel will make it difficult to concentrate, to remember things, to do things efficiently, etc... Your second question is probably the more important one. Learning, in the shorthand clinical sense, is your ability to take in new information and apply it efficiently (like you if learned to cut an onion today, you know that skill now). The interesting thing is that learning is what helps you overcome depression, like you learn new coping skills, new thought processes, new emotional regulation skills.  There’s even some radical thought out there from 80s psychologists who will argue that depression is evolutionarily a necessary process; our bodies and minds need to take time to regroup, find comfort, and focus on our health needs. You might sleep a lot not because you’re tired, but your brain might want process something to learn that you have a hard time dealing with when you’re awake. It’s important to get “good sleep” versus “a lot of sleep” or to eat foods that satisfy your needs and make you feel good, versus eating unhealthy and it makes you feel worse.  Ok I’ve digressed. What I’m trying to say in a roundabout way is that if you are clinically depressed, of course you’re going to have problems writing reports or doing math, or whatever. However, one part of overcoming depression is “learning” in itself. Dr. Mark Reinecke, a psychologist famous for his work on adolescent depression, once quoted depression as being “when one’s expectations don’t meet the reality.” We have to “learn” how to accept our reality: of who we are, of how difficult things are, but also how amazing you are and what you are capable of, and what you’ve done. It’s just that with depression, it hurts and it’s difficult to do things, which makes it so much harder to do other things for ourselves.  I hope you are finding treatment for this; if not, I highly recommend it and therapy is probably the only medicine with no negative side effects. I promise you that if you can take one step at a time, the next step get easier, and it gets better. EDIT: I seem to be getting a lot of heat for my oversimplification of IQ testing and psychedelic medication. So I’ll just pin this here. 1) I think a lot of others have responded with awesome responses about IQ, so I was hoping to put things in layman’s terms. We test IQ to understand more about someone’s cognitive functioning, and that informs us of their capabilities and and areas where one might need more help. A lot of tests have tasks related to motor function, executive (decision making) functioning, impulse control, perception, memory, learning, and I was hoping to equate that to something more similar to real life, like being able to follow directions, ability to recall things etc...  The point I wanted to get across is that IQ results don’t make a person. Everyone functions different, as we excel and struggle in different ways. Depression can exacerbate those struggles and inhibit our strengths. 2) I took some time to look at psychedelic research, and found that there is a lot of interest and positive outlook towards that medication in the last few year. Which is great, I’m all for finding out more about how we can help people. However in most my reading, there are two important distinctions in the latest reviews: that we need to do efficacy studies, and that these are targeted towards those who are “resistant” to the current standard of care.  I also was hasty in my readings of some comments. Most of the time, when people talk anecdotal stories of self-medications making them better, it’s usually not described as prescribed medication or participating in a medical trial. I apologize to people who are more educated on the subject, and I hope the people who read those comments below follow up on the research as well. However, I will stand firm on disregarding those who say “I took some LSD/shrooms, went to the into the woods and it cured my depression.” If it truly helped you, great. But it might not work for everyone, and when it comes to mental health, there’s a lot more than just anecdotal evidence at face value. In the same vein, don’t take what I say at face value, as I was obviously behind in my knowledge of current medication research. Talk to your provider about what you need to address in treatment. Ask for the research behind it.  I also stated “don’t use something external for something internal.” That was a bad generalization on my part. I think a better way to phrase what I meant was “use the treatments related to your disorder.” Something that address what’s going on for you. So yes, medications are beneficial and show efficacy, and if prescribed to you, you should follow your doctors suggestions. What you should not do is maladaptive coping behaviors, such as using avoidance. For example, “retail therapy” might make you feel better in the moment, but are you really addressing what’s going on? I hope this all makes sense. Best to you all.  Back to normal redditing for me. Edit 2: Wow, I haven’t been gilded before! I appreciate the generosity, but If there are any other kind people out there thinking of awarding something, please consider donating instead to a mental health charity. This helps with further research into how we can best help treat people, and the field moves so quickly thanks to the support of the public.",540

I find it interesting that they can survive the venom and develop the ""anti-venom"" to it, but they still suffer from this effect.  What is the scientifical reason for this to happen and can people suffer from the same effect from spider bites, albeit in a minor form due to probably much less venom being injected?","There is no evidence to support the claim that the horses' lifespans are so drastically reduced. All of the answers here are just speculation to explain that unsupported statement in the article.  The WHO makes no mention of reduced lifespan of horses during antivenom production in their guidelines; neither [here: ""Selection and veterinary health care of animals used for production of antivenoms""](https://www.who.int/bloodproducts/snake_antivenoms/snakeantivenomguideline.pdf) nor [here: ""The Ethical Use of Animals""](https://www.who.int/bloodproducts/AntivenomGLrevWHO_TRS_1004_web_Annex_5.pdf).

And again [here: ""Report of a WHO workshop""](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12676433/) they have a nice discussion about how important the health of the horse or other anti-venom producing subject is, but never address a drastic reduction in life expectancy.  [This NewScientist article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23524-synthetic-spider-venom-makes-a-kinder-safer-antidote/) from the same year makes no mention of this adverse effect on the anti-venom producing horses.",2432
il4hr3,"In the Apollo 11 documentary it is mentioned at some point that astronauts wore space suits which had 100% oxygen pumped in them, but the space shuttle was pressurized with a mixture of 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen. Since our atmosphere is also a mixture of these two gases, why are astronauts required to have 100-percent oxygen?",It's actually not a biology reason but an engineering one. Humans can breath pretty much ok as long as the oxygen pressure is around what we are used to. For example at 1 atmosphere of pressure we have about 20% oxygen in air. The trick you can do it lower the pressure and increase the oxygen content and people will still be fine. With pure oxygen you can comfortably live with only 30% of sea level pressure. This is useful in spacecraft because lower pressures mean lighter weight systems.  For Apollo (and Gemini and Mercury before them) the idea was to start on the ground with 100% oxygen at slightly higher pressure than 1 atmosphere to make sure seals were properly sealing. Then as the capsule rose into lower pressure air the internal pressure would be decreased until it reached 0.3 atmosphere once in space. However pure oxygen at high pressure will make a lot of things very flammable which was underestimated by NASA. During a ground test a fire broke out and the 3 astronauts of Apollo 1 died burned alive in the capsule. At lower pressures this fire risk is less of an issue but now pure oxygen atmospheres have been abandoned in most area of spaceflight. The only use case is into spacesuits made for outside activities. Those are very hard to move into because they basically act like giant pressurized balloons. To help with that they are using low pressure pure oxygen.

ioue15,"Have any/many failed and been dropped already? If so, was that due to side effects of lack of efficacy? How many are looking promising still? And what are the best estimates as to global public roll out?","They're all progressing steadily - no major failures have been reported yet, but this will take time. Best estimates are initial/topline data by year end, with a potential approval shortly after. Global roll out to public is unlikely till around June or so next year (due to a combination of manufacturing times, approvals etc.)The problem is that to prove a vaccine works is fundamentally different from a therapeutic. With a therapeutic, you can give the therapsutic/drug  to x people, placebo to x people, and in a relatively short time ( weeks to months) you can find out who's getting better, and prove efficacy.With vaccines, you need time most importantly. You can give the vaccine to x people, and placebo to x people - and then you need to wait certain time - long enough to compare infection rates between placebo and vaccine group. For e.g. there's 3 possible outcomes 1. Infection rates are comparable between placebo and vaccine --> vaccine isn't efficacious 2. Infection rates are significantly higher in placebo group than vaccine --> great, vaccine works.... 3. Infection rate is low in BOTH placebo and vaccine groups, and comparable -- This is the most irritating scenario. Because this could be due to 2 reasons - vaccine worked, but general infectivity dropped in both groups - due to social distancing, precautions, whatever. OR. vaccine didn't work, becasue the vaccine group was affected at teh same rate as the placebo group --- Meaning this is inconclusive. This is very common in vaccine studies and why a large number of vaccines fail in Phase 3. To reduce the likelihood of option 3, the approach is to test in large numbers of patients, over a significant amount of time ( 6 mo or so) , so that they can have data on the placebo side to compare. That's why this will take time. Also the reason why anyone saying they'll have ""great results"" for a phase 3 trial that started in June/July by Oct/Nov is either unaware of the level of data needed, or is bowing to non-scientific pressure. That said, you could have preliminary data (from a part of the tested population etc.) sooner than year end, but usually that's not enough to approve drugs unless in extreme circumstances. Additionally, a longer follow up is required for safety, which we may not have by then. So we could see promising candidates start to show up soon, but not ready for global prime time till mid next year Source: Ph.D. in Vaccine Immunology. Edit: Fixed typo. Edit: Thanks for the gold!!!! Edit 3: Wow. Thanks for all the awards. Now I have to figure out what they actually do! I'm reading the replies and am trying to answer them as best as I can. Edit 4: To clarify my timeline estimate further, I was referring to June as the expectation for the general public, i.e. all of us. The vaccines will most likely be rolled out in stages, with front line workers or high risk populations first.  Depending on if EUA is granted, we could see a conditional or emergency approval by early next year meaning those groups could get this by March or so. And then it'll be available to the rest by June. **Edit 5:** My best post ever, and the day I post AZ halts their trial - smh. This halt is not a failure. It's proof that the system is working as it was designed to, with the clinicians observing an AE they didn't expect, and so the trial is paused till they understand it better.  **Edit 6:** The most frequent qn below is why not test the vaccine by infecting them with the virus. I've answered below, but briefly its ethics. Informed Consent is a key part of trials, and even more important in these cases to communicate the risks involved. We still don't know all the potential long term consequences, so how do you convince someone to risk their life by purposely giving them a potentially fatal virus? Offering money etc, would also be unethical. It's a complex topic - not unlikely but very complex.",12997
irxncu,"I mean, if a human starts from two cells (sperm & egg) and all subsequent cells have the same DNA, then how does each cell know where it should go, i.e. arm, liver, bone, etc. What’s to stop them all trying to become the same thing?","Hello! I'm a developmental biologist. Specifically, I study how the cells that become the brain and nervous system know exactly what to become. TL;DR: cells use a variety of methods to figure out 'when' in development they are, and where they are. Most commonly, they count how many different choices have been made to identify 'when'. To identify 'where', certain cells act as landmarks, and give off chemical signals. The stronger the signal, the closer a cell is to the landmark. DNA contains specific instructions on how to interpret this combination of 'when' and 'where'.  In detail: Let's start with DNA. We often here DNA compared to a recipe book, with genes being recipes. I prefer to think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure. A zygote (which is what we call the cell made when an egg and sperm fuse) doesn't actually have access to the whole of its DNA. Most of it is packed tightly away. It does have access to 'chapter one', which mostly begins 'if no other chapters are open, start here'. This cell will divide many times, and eventually change shape. In order for a cell to know what chapter to read, it needs to know two things: where in the zygote/embryo it is, and 'when' in development it is. Embryonic cells are extremely accurate at identifying this information. We don't know all the ways they do this yet. However, we know of some mechanisms. First, there's the DNA-CYOA book itself. Every time a cell 'opens' a new chapter, with a new set of instructions, it packs away some of the old, no-longer-relevant chapters. It labels them extensively in the process, in case they're needed again. And when I say it packs the DNA away, I mean that literally. [This is a diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin_Verstrepen/publication/51196608/figure/fig1/AS:276923784679429@1443035183356/Chromatin-structure-DNA-is-wrapped-around-a-histone-octamer-to-form-nucleosomes.png) of DNA in various packed and unpacked forms. At the top is the famous double helix. In reality, DNA only exists in this fully unpacked form while it's being read. Next, is 'tidied' up DNA. This is accessible, but not actively being read. Then as you go further down, it gets more and more packed away and inaccessible. That's what it looks like when a DNA sequence is 'turned off' - it's literally filed and packed away. You may have heard of epigenetics. This is the collective term for the molecular tags that label DNA, and the molecular duct tape that keeps DNA packed up safely. When a cell divides, it copies its epigenetic pattern out - and so the daughter cells have the same bits of the book packed away and labelled. Going back to the CYOA book, this is like a bookmark. This is one of the ways that a cell can tell 'when' it is in development. If it's at chapter 13, it knows that chapters 1-12 have already been read.  As for 'where', let me introduce you to my favourite protein: Sonic Hedgehog, aka SHH (That's genuinely the name of the protein). SHH is what's known as a 'morphogen'. It's a signal that tells cells what to become. In SHH's case, it tells cells how far they are from a certain landmark. It's used in a number of different contexts, but neural development is what I know best, so I'll use that as an example. Before your brain became a brain, it was a tube - called the neural tube. This runs along the whole back of the embryo, and eventually becomes the brain and spinal chord. In early development, it's the factory where the entire nervous system is made. The cells on the very bottom of the neural tube make a ton of SHH. Other cells sense how much SHH there is around them by eating up the SHH that bumps into them at the right spots. This means that really near the bottom, there's a ton of SHH, while near the middle, there's very little. At the top, there's none at all. This is called a concentration gradient. Cells in the neural tube count how much SHH they eat, and then refer back to their DNA books. The instructions tell them to open certain chapters if they eat enough SHH, and close others. Cells also check with their neighbours, also through chemical signals, to see if they agree on decisions. The result is a very specific link between SHH concentration (and thus distance from the SHH producing cells) and cell identity.  ~~[This image](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Dorsal-ventral-patterning-of-the-neural-tube%3A-a-of-Dr%C3%A9au-Mart%C3%AD/a73582b5b612510a71adeaa0045fa9527570bbaa/figure/0) shows that in practice~~. *edit: link is broken. Found the same image [here](https://www.slideshare.net/HarshaKumar2/dorsoventral-patterning-of-the-brain) and [this](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dneu.22015) is the original citation*. Cells with different identities produce different proteins. In this picture, those proteins have been dyed different colours, showing the pattern of cell identities in a cross section of the neural tube. The graph on the left shows different genetic chapters, basically. Each of those horizontal stripes represents a different type of cell - a motor neuron, or a type of sensory neuron, or maybe an ~~dendrite~~ astrocyte. You'll see that they're turned 'on' at a specific distance from the bottom, and turned off further away. The combination of genetic chapters that are 'open' determines cell identity. Finally, we have chemotaxis. When a cell is 'finished' with its time in the neural tube - ie. The factory, it will migrate out and go to where it is needed. It does this in a very similar manner to SHH signalling. Landmark cells emit a signal. Each landmark emits a different kind of signal. Cells with different identities have machinery that allows them to sense only very specific signals. They then follow the concentration gradient towards the source.",6312

itt9b7,"An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial ""aerial"" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin. Signs of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.

We have remdesivir as an antiviral for treatment which has shown an increase in favorable outcomes, albeit this medication can also come with other dangers and certainly isn't a cure all. Convalescent plasma is also available which has shown some benefit as well, but really isn't truly studied well enough to say how much.  I'm just nurse, so if any physicians or other providers have any corrections or anything I missed,  please feel free to chime in. Edit: forgot to mention hypercoagulopthy.

ixaqe9,"I wonder if a non-sterile probe may have left Earth, have all but the most extremophile / adaptable microbes survive the journey, or microbes capable of desiccating in the vacuum of space and rehydrating once in the Venusian atmosphere, and so already adapted to the life cycles proposed by [Seager et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06474)?","There is the notion of panspermia where life spreads from one to world to another through natural process. Bacterial spores floating high in Earth's atmosphere have been detected in space immediately surrounding the Earth, blown out there by solar winds. Large surface explosions such as volcanos or meteor impacts can also knock tons of material into space at escape velocities (meaning it will not fall back to the ground). Significantly, bacterial and fungal spores left openly exposed to space for years have been recovered and revived. Hypothetically such spores could spread to other planets and moons within the solar system and beyond.  Potentially this means that bodies within the Solar system could have been swapping life for billions of years. Taken this idea to extremes could mean that life-bearing worlds through the galaxy are leaving a biological slick in their wake as their systems orbit the galactic axis. Interstellar space could be filled with in-tact biological material.",6042

It's also pretty hard to authenticate votes and ""prove"" they were recorded correctly without identifying who people voted for, and with electronic voting you can't go back and recount with surety like you can with paper (ie if the computer records it wrong, then there's no way to work that out) Paper ballots are still the best option, even for remote voting and early voting",3461
jocnxr,Like the position each joint and limb returns to at complete rest or if like there were no external forces on it? Not sure if this makes question makes complete sense but I think you get the gist but I’m kind of wondering at whether some lounging positions are more harmful or “unnatural” than others despite feeling relaxing at the time.,"There is a law of kinesiology known as Davis' Law of Soft Tissue Adaption which states that muscles change according to the stress (or lack thereof) placed upon them. Depending on how you use your body, your muscles will have a different length and tonicity than other people, meaning that if you were to knock someone unconscious and put them somewhere with zero gravity, people would end up in different positions. The closest thing you might be able to think of as a ""default"" position might be fetal position, since everyone more or less starts out in that identical position. While it doesn't exactly match what you're talking about, there are also two ""anatomical positions"" that medical technicians use as a point of reference. Western medicine's anatomical position is that of someone standing straight up, feet about shoulder width apart, with the palms facing forward (as a result of the shoulder turning the palms this way - NOT supination from the elbow.) Eastern anatomical position is the same, except that the arms are raised, as if to make a circle shape around the head (although the hands do not touch.) In this position, the palms also face forward.",6482

juqulz,"I have seen many mentions, that being overweight is one of the risk factors to have more sever case of COVID-19. I wonder, why exactly does this happen. Is it related to the fact that overweight people are often less active (don't exercise much, have sedentary lifestyle, etc - so, for example, their respiratory system is more susceptible to the impact of the virus) or does it have something to do with being overweight in general (hormones, metabolism or something else) ?  &#x200B; Why do I ask: I'm overweight, I started to exercise regularly since spring and dropped about 9 kg/19 pounds so far. Such tasks like going upstairs or running are much easier now, but my weight is still above the norm for my age/height. So I wonder if I've lowered the risk of getting the severe form of covid-19.

And huge respect to AskScience moderators for clearing all these ""because fat is bad"" useless and/or insulting answers, that I see in mobile notifications.  And yes, I understand that being overweight or obese is unhealthy in general, no need to remind me about this. My question was about that particular case with covid-19. More detailed understanding of how it works, helps me to stay motivated. (The covid threat wasn't the main reason for my desire to lose weight, I have many other inner and outer reasons for that. It just happened that staying at home on lockdown helped me to start eating healthier and working out more regularly).","Studies have shown it is likely several reasons: breathing (abdominal fat pushing on the diaphragm), weakened immune system (fat cells in the spleen, bone marrow and thymus leads to impaired function), clotting (obesity increases clotting, and covid triggers clots), inflammation, and delayed care-seeking (people with obesity tend to delay seeking care).

Microwave ovens use 1100 watts (where I live anyway), and the construction of the microwave keeps all those waves contained in a tiny box. So the difference is the concentration of that energy.

kaj3h5," I heard the Spanish Flu affected people who were healthy harder that those with weaker immune systems because it triggered an higher autoimmune response. If we had the ventilators we do today, would the deaths have been comparable? Or is it impossible to say?","Spanish Flu was signficantly more deadly than any other known influenza. Where a ""normal"" flu rarely has a mortality >0.1% , that of Spanish Flu is estimated to have been > 2.5% - so significantly higher than Covid-19. It also had a strange mortality curve. Nearly all influenza show a ""U curve"" when plotted against age. So high deaths among under 5s lowering as age increases - flattening out, then rising sharply with after 65.  Spanish flu showed a ""W"" curve - similar to a U curve , but with a ""hump"" peaking at 35. (one of the panics about early reports of 2009 Swine Flu was the number of younger people it killed) With modern treatment, undoubtedly the Spansh Flu deaths would have been lower - one of the main causes of death was probably secondary bacterial infection as there were no antibiotics. That said, subsequent mutations were significantly less deadly, so something in the virus itself must have been responsible. An educated guess would be that a modern Spanish flu would still be deadlier than Covid, and would likely still kill millions despite improved medical care.",6037

This makes it a much more difficult task to come up with an effective vaccine for HIV. As for the others, its more of an economic reason than a biological one.

kkkh6k,"This is within context of the KSTAR project, but I'm curious how a material can contain that much heat.  100,000,000°c seems like an ABSURD amount of heat to contain. Is it strictly a feat of material science, or is there more at play? (chemical shielding, etc)  https://phys.org/news/2020-12-korean-artificial-sun-world-sec-long.html","I’m a designer for the plasma-facing armor system in the upcoming SPARC tokamak. This is actually one of the most common questions I get from people when I tell them what I work on.  The key to containing such hot plasma is taking advantage of the fact plasma is composed of charged particles, so it can be shaped by a series of extremely powerful magnets to prevent it from contacting the inner walls of the machine. Needless to say, some plasma will still touch the walls, so an array of carefully engineered tiles made of special materials (typically tungsten alloys or certain composites) that can survive very short exposures to high heat fluxes are used to protect the other parts of the machine.  One of the most interesting parts of the armor design is a region called the ‘divertor,’ which essentially acts as an exhaust system for the plasma. In this region we intentionally smash the plasma into the armor. As you can imagine, this presents another layer of complexity to design and engineering. Check out one of the papers my colleagues published on our divertor system if you’re curious about the more technical aspects.

So I’m reposting it with less “hypothetical” language.  It’s my understanding that the first dose (of the Pfizer vaccine) is 52% effective at preventing COVID and the second is 95% effective. So what happens if you are exposed to COVID and contract it in the 21/28 days between doses? In the trials, did those participants get the second dose? Did they get it while infectious or after recovering? Or were they removed from the study?  Asking because I just received the Moderna vaccine a few days ago and I want to know what would happen if I were to get it from one of my patients during the limbo period between doses. Thanks!","This is actually happening quite a bit out there, though many had the exposure prior to their first dose but were not aware until afterwards. In practice, we will be giving the 2nd dose once they have completed isolation and cleared the acute infection. However, in general, we are trying to wait 90 days from a positive to start the vaccine. Both because you generally don't vaccinate people who are acutely ill and because people are immune for at least 90 days anyway. Here's what CDC said 4 days ago about the timing of 2nd doses:  ""Second doses administered within a grace period of ≤4 days from the recommended date for the second dose are considered valid; however, doses administered earlier do not need to be repeated. The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second dose for either vaccine.""",2719
kwgqxc,As in igniting f.ex. paper.,"The answer is YES! But not without special treatment. The trick is to HEAT THE STEAM ITSELF! Imagine a pot of water on the cook top.  Instead of the lid making a seal, make the lid have a single copper hose (maybe .5cm internal diameter) coming out into a tightly looped coil.  As the water in the pot boils, the vapors above the water (the steam) will expand and flow through the copper coil.  If you place a torch under the copper coil itself, you are now adding thermal energy to the steam!

Once at the core, there is no gravity, so the speed of the object doesn't change at the core. So the object will shoot straight through towards the other side.

At that point, it would finally come to a stop, before being pulled back down. The object would continue to oscillate between the two ends of the tunnel.

n0l3qn,"I really tried to google this, but I didn't see clear explanations on the difference. If I google RBG then I find posts which call these the primary additive colors, with green and red making yellow. I thought maybe my primary schooling was just old and color theory had changed a bit, but if I google primary colors for art purposes like painting, then it seems that blue, red and yellow are still the primaries for, say, mixing paints.","Our eyes contain receptors sensitive to red, green, and blue light. There is some overlap between them at the edges of their sensitivity spectra. We see yellow when our red and green receptors are both stimulated. This can be caused by light wavelengths in between red and green stimulating both receptors, but a mix of red and green light will also stimulate both receptors. Hence RGB for light-emitting screens. Paint and pigment is based on reflecting *and* absorbing light, rather than directly mixing light. This leads to different effects from mixing pigments vs mixing light. You're not only combining the reflected light bands, but also cancelling them out via absorbed light bands. Edit: why yellow and blue make green. Yellow paint reflects red and green light while absorbing blue. Blue paint reflects blue light while absorbing more red light than green light. Red-absorption from blue paint cancels out red-reflection from yellow paint, and blue-absorption from yellow paint cancels out blue-reflection from blue paint. Green-absorption from blue paint doesn't quite cancel out green-reflection from yellow paint, so the resulting paint mix is green. Replacing blue paint with cyan paint will result in a brighter green, since cyan paint mainly absorbs red while reflecting blue and green.",6899
