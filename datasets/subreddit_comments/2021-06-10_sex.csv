1t1vic,"I've recently read a few posts on here related to unequal sex drives within a relationship and dead bedrooms, especially when they're long term.  Since I've been in the same relationship for fifteen years (we met in middle school) and I've experienced this imbalance several times throughout our partnership, I've had to come up with a solution for getting us back on track when this happens.    I usually see people saying the same thing in each post: ""I've tried everything, and he/she just isn't interested.  They say they want to change it, but nothing works.""    I then see the same answers:  ""It's probably her birth control"" (which is definitely possible, but not likely if you've been using the same method for years) or ""just break up, don't waste your time"" (also completely valid if it's been an *ongoing* issue and one partner refuses to put forth effort).    What I don't see enough of is constructive advice on exactly how to seduce a partner that you've been with for years already.  It's sad that many times we think, ""hey, I've already put in the time and effort to nail you down, it should be easy from now on.""  In my experience, that has been wrong, wrong, wrong.  Especially since I'm female, I've always been told he should always be in the mood, just put on something sexy and grab his dick.  No ""real man"" would turn you down.  That lead to me feeling insecure about myself and our relationship.  Honestly, it took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that he needed more than just the quick ""hey guess what, I'm horny"" to grab his interest.    However, I did eventually find a few things that *did* seem to work for us, thank god!  First though, I think it's important to note that when other issues come up in a LTR, sex is usually the first thing to go.  This is all assuming that you don't have any other major problems to resolve first.  *  I noticed that when he's stressed, sex is usually off the table.  To counteract this, I'll try to plan something nice for when he gets home.  Either I'll make a nice dinner, or I'll clean the house, put on some nice music, and light a candle.  That way, when he walks in the door after fighting traffic for an hour after a long day at the job he hates, he's immediately disarmed and begins to relax.    *  I've also realized that walking into the room naked and expecting him to drop what he's doing to focus on me and my needs is a little unreasonable.  So now, I'll leave him be for a few hours to unwind and get out of ""work mode"".  Once he's chilled out, I've found that my odds of getting laid increase exponentially.    *  After I've gotten him all nice and relaxed is when I pounce!  However, I don't just go sit next to him while he's watching TV and start pawing at him.  I'll first make sure to get his attention in another way to put his focus directly on me.  I'll ask him about his day and we'll chat for a few minutes. I'll crack a few jokes and tease him, get him to laugh.  I'll try to get physical with just little touches here and there.  This often leads to kissing, which turns into making out, which leads to...well you know.  The point is to get him mentally prepared before even approaching him physically.    I guess the most important thing I've learned from all of our ups and downs, is that keeping this train moving takes some *real* effort.  At some of the worst times, I've considered leaving him for a new ""fun and exciting"" relationship, where there are sparks flying and everything is easy.  I'm glad I didn't.  I could very well have ended up in the same spot with a different person, and I would have lost all of the other wonderful parts of our relationship.  I just thought I'd write this out for anyone experiencing the same problem, mainly to let you know that it *can* get better, but there is no magic solution, only love and serious effort.  And if anyone else has some tips they'd like to add, I would love to hear them.    TL;DR  Don't take your relationship for granted.  Nothing is owed to you.  Putting in the work is what will get you the results.  <--- who would have thought, eh?  EDIT:  Thank you guys so much for all of your comments, I've read them all and I really appreciate hearing your stories.  Also a HUGE thank you to the person that gave me gold!!!  I'm feeling super confident and happy right now, which never hurts the efforts in the bedroom.  ;)  EDIT 2:  I've seen a few people commenting that they feel my approach is a little 1950's-esque.  I can understand where those thoughts would come in, but I'd hope that the take-away is that this can be applied to either gender.  I realize that my post isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, and I certainly didn't intend for it to be. I attempted to tell my story in a personal way, while staying gender neutral when possible. This isn't a problem isolated to only men or only women, and I'd hope that the message is to put forth whatever effort you can, no matter your ""role"" in the relationship.

2lgf19,"After some pain during (safe) sex last weekend and some itching, I went to the local women's clinic and requested an exam and STD tests (it's a new partner so that's the right thing to do, right?) When I saw the doctor come in I was apprehensive because this doctor ALWAYS tells me my problem is a yeast infection, gives me a pill and shoes me out. This time, same drill, asks me a few questions, then tells me she's gonna give me a pill for Yeast. This time I insisted I wanted and exam, she made a big sigh, ""really? OK then."" While I was up in stirrups she asked how many partners I'd had in 6 weeks, I said 2. Then  when asked when my last full round of tests was, I said 10 months ago and I'd had 4 partners since then. Then she said, in a really condescending way, ""maybe you should try having less partners, then you won't have to worry so much."" I was kind of floored and mortified, I mean, that's totally uncalled-for right? Especially for a health professional? I'm trying to do the right thing, even if I had a new partner every week, I'm expressing a concern for them and myself. Turns out I had BV, if I hadn't insisted I'd be no closer to getting my health back on track. Should I file a complaint? This was a clinic in California (not planned parenthood.) TL;DR responsible adult goes in for STD testing, gets shamed by doctor EDIT: thank you for the validating comments, when someone in that position says something like that, your first instinct can be, ""geez she's right, I'm terrible."" EDIT2: this was a free clinic (sure you get what you pay for) is there a specific office in California that oversee these (specifically LA.) EDIT3: wow this took off, well this gives me some perspective, YES although gruff her response is legit: Having fewer partners would decrease the odds, my main concern and reason for wanting to bring it to someone's attention is the apprehension I felt upon seeing her and KNOWING I'd have to plea to get an exam and KNOWING she'd try to insist on a medication without a physical exam. The last time I'd seen this doctor was 2012 when I was experiencing random bleeding, after having to find another OBGYN (they were closed and I was hysterically upset) it simply turned out to be over-active ovaries in hyperdrive ovulating more than normal. Her initial diagnosis? Yeast infection.","Wow, that was a stupid thing for her to say. I'd file a complaint. It just doesn't sit right with me that she'd be so condescending. It's one thing to suggest more frequent testing if you have a lot of partners or to recommend a wider array of tests for that reason. But her comment wasn't helpful at all.",1681
2rb9lx,"I don't know if anyone else has noticed the influx of ""my boyfriend and I had unprotected sex and my period is late, am I pregnant?"" posts lately, but I definitely have. They clog up the /r/sex subreddit and, more importantly, **describing a sexual situation and asking strangers if you or your partner could be pregnant based on that situation is not definitive proof of pregnancy**.  If you are concerned that you are pregnant, take a pregnancy test or visit your doctor. Pregnancy tests can be found at the dollar store and are much more accurate than strangers who only have the information you've provided. It's a lot cheaper to buy a pregnancy test now than it is to deal with an unexpected pregnancy two months later when you start experiencing symptoms.  Edit: For the sake of discussion, based on the comments received, do you guys think this should be a rule in the sidebar? Should mods remove posts asking whether or not someone is pregnant? I'm curious what other people think. ","Not to mention, the symptoms for pregnancy mimic the symptoms for other regular female bodily functions so literally no one can tell.",588
2wiqdw,"I am not sure what I am hoping to accomplish by writing this post. Normally, I just don't think about what happened, I gave up trying to explain it to people I actually know years ago. And even here on Reddit, there's no place that is actually right for this post, where-ever I put it I am either going to be dismissed as a troll, held up as some kind of symbol, or...I don't know. Maybe just typing it will be enough. I don't have to actually hit 'post'.  I've tried to talk to people about this, but it has gotten me nowhere. The only place I got any acceptance and support at all was a support group for victims of male on male rape, and even there, most of them laughed and/or told me to quit whining. I tried telling my ex-wife, once, shortly after we were married.... It didn't go well, I wound up telling her it was a joke, I made it up, boy I sure had her going.... She didn't think it was funny. It's not. I keep dancing around it, even anonymously I don't want to say it outright. I'm a man, and about 25 years ago, I was raped by a woman. Before that, when I was a young child I was the victim of physical child abuse with a sexual component. I don't think it could strictly be termed rape, she was spanking me with a hairbrush and decided that since I wouldn't cry and scream from that anymore, she was going to sodomize me with it. I don't even know which one is actually bothering me right now, they're all kind of mixed up together, you know? I don't think the bit with the hairbrush is really my problem, though. It was horrible, and I still have some medical problems from it, but I think it's easier for me to process. There's no ambiguity, no sense that somehow what happened to me wasn't really a bad thing, or that it was somehow my fault, or that I'm just not understanding it.... I understand it; She was a horrible person, she hated my father at that moment, and since she couldn't get at him she took it out on me. Maybe somebody did something like it to her when she was a child, that whole 'cycle of abuse' thing. Anyway, it's a bucket of suck, but it doesn't really gnaw at me. The other is harder. I was an adult. Not just an adult man, a pretty big and strong one. I was in probably the best shape of my life, actively training in martial arts, I could crush a beer can in my hands, without opening it first (great party trick, when you're in your 20's and somewhere you don't mind spraying beer all over the place). You could break a two by four over nearly any part of my body at that point, and I'd have shrugged it off. I was in the military, and like a lot of young guys in the military I did a lot of drinking. If I wasn't on duty for a Friday or Saturday night, I was going to be somewhere getting at least slightly sloshed, if not totally loaded. Things weren't as freewheeling back then as I guess they are these days, but there was still plenty of one night stands and I probably had more than my share. It was pretty much the height of the AIDS panic, the sexual revolution came to a crashing halt just before I got to join the fun. But I was decent looking, and even in an environment that was about 90% male, I managed to get 'action'. And then I got engaged, and although I kept partying, I quit hitting on girls and I probably didn't drink as much or as often. But one night there was sort of a spontaneous party in my dorm, there were girls there from the military, girls and women from the married housing, and some civilians too. Just one of those things that happen when the random shuffle of ""I heard there's a party over there"" brings a lot of people to the same place. So I open my door and invite people to raid my stash of booze (always amazed me that the military would talk about what a terrible alcohol abuse problem they had, then sell us booze for less than half what it cost off-base. We couldn't afford to drink at a bar more than once a week, but we could get hammered every night out of loose change, on the good imported stuff that cost a fortune in civilian markets). People shuffle in, people shuffle out, the booze on hand starts to run out and groups start saying ""I heard they're doing something near the west gate"" or whatever, and heading out (nobody had cell phones back then, this kind of whispers game was how it worked). I'm mildly sloshed and not wanting to drive, and not really wanting to be depending on getting a ride back from where-ever, so I just let them go off and head for bed (it's like 11pm or midnight, and I was on duty the next day, which didn't always stop me but I was trying to be more responsible). I wake up to my penis being stroked. My fiance had a key to my  room (we weren't supposed to make copies, but a lot of us did and we had made them for each other) and sometimes liked to surprise me. I'm still mostly asleep and I just sort of go with it. But at some point, it dawns on me. The hands I'm feeling are feminine, but they don't move like my fiance's. Her hair's wrong, straight instead of curly. She doesn't smell right. What the hell, my fiance is on temporary assignment on the other side of the country and not going to be back for weeks.  I freak the hell out and scramble out of bed (I wouldn't notice until later, but she grabbed onto me and left fingernail scratches on my penis and upper thigh, it actually bled quite a bit and I noticed the blood before I felt them). I turn on the lights, and some woman I vaguely recognize from earlier (she was checking me out and maybe flirting a bit) is sitting on my bed. Mid-30's, blond, pretty decent looking, what they call a 'MILF' now. And she's really not understanding that I'm not interested in cheating on my fiance. I don't remember the exact words of the conversation, but it was generally her saying ""come on, let's fuck"" and me saying ""no, get out of my room"". Finally, I've had enough, I grab her by a forearm, pull her off the bed, and push her out the door. She spends a couple of minutes pounding on my door and yelling things like ""Who the fuck do you think you are, you can't do this to me!"", then she leaves. I'm done sleeping for the night, I wind up getting dressed and going to work so I can use the computers at the office (my job was essentially just to be there if someone actually needed something, and back then PC's were really expensive and not something I could afford). To be honest, I was playing Minesweeper and Solitaire. I would have been in trouble if I got caught (and it wouldn't have been the first time) but it had been months since the commander had come in on a weekend, and I was the person who would be calling him, nobody else was going to be in there unless things went sideways in a way they thought needed to be reported up the chain right away (and they'd drop it in my lap, so I could decide if it was worth calling in the commander). Working the weekend earned me brownie points, and I kind of needed them (I mentioned I was trying to be more responsible, well that was because I hadn't always been). I'm stalling. I don't want to write this next part. I don't really see anybody all day, nobody comes into the office, couple of phone calls telling me to log that they are reporting that they have filled out their logs and will be sending them in to be filed, typical military Mickey Mouse pencil-whipping crap. I go off-base to grab some fast food, then head back to my room. I'm hoping my fiance will call, she generally did at least once every weekend (again, this is back in the days of by-the-minute long distance charges, and using the government phones for personal calls was Not Authorized, so we couldn't spend much time actually talking). Shit, I'm still stalling, trying to fill this space with minutiae so I don't have to get to the point. She shows up knocking at my door. She tells me that if I don't let her in, she's going to have the SP's come and drag me out. I open the door, ask her ""for what?"" She's going to report me for trying to rape her. She's told one of her friends that I had tried to keep her in my room so I could, and she's got little baggies with my skin from under her nails to prove it, and she can tell them I'm not circumcised, and that I have scratches on my groin from when she fought me off, and big finger-shaped bruises on her arm from where I restrained her. She's got physical evidence, she's got a believable story, and I have not always been the best example of military discipline and it won't be hard for her to convince her best friend's husband, the head of base security, that I need to get the full-on Leavenworth and Dishonorable Discharge treatment. Oh, and just to make it perfectly clear how screwed I am, her husband works for the JAG office, the office that would both prosecute and defend me in a court-martial. At some point in this I've gone sort of numb and dizzy, sat down, and she's walked in and closed the door.This was right after the military first started taking sexual assault seriously, they'd set up a special office on nearly every base to investigate and pursue it, and they were collecting scalps all over the place to show they were serious. Hadn't been any on ours yet, but we'd heard rumors and read news stories, guys were getting rushed into and through a General court martial within days of being reported (normally they took weeks just to convene). I was practically a perfect one, I looked kind of big and scary, I was an extremely junior officer with no political connections and a spotty record (not bad enough to screw my career prospects completely, but enough that nobody would consider me worth trying to save even if they believed me). Her husband was connected, several grades up from me and considered a good prospect for promotion, and she was wired into the informal shadow hierarchy officer's wives have, everybody who mattered on that base was married to one of her friends, she had other friends married into higher commands, the Pentagon. I was so completely at her mercy, I would be asking permission to speak within days at most (military prisoners have to ask permission to speak, to change their clothes, pretty much every damned thing probably including asking to be permitted to wipe after using the toilet) if she did what she was threatening. A few years of that hell in Leavenworth, then a Dishonorable Discharge and a lifetime of being even *lower* than the typical ex-convict (just for the Dishonorable, they didn't really have Sex Offender registries back then, I think). You can probably guess what came next, and I don't really want to talk about the details. She used me for her personal sex-toy for the rest of the time I was in the military.  She'd get bored of me, or her husband would be paying attention, or I'd be on temporary duty elsewhere (and I volunteered for every one of them I could get), and I'd get a few weeks respite. But she'd get drunk and strike out at the clubs, or her husband would piss her off, or she'd just randomly feel like it, and I'd have to do what she wanted. After a while, it wasn't even the fear of a rape charge, I just couldn't imagine trying to explain myself.  My fiance broke up with me, she thought I was having an affair and I couldn't bring myself to explain what was actually going on. It was almost a relief, at least I didn't have to lie to her anymore, didn't have to fear what she would think of me if she knew. I guess I'm lucky that she wasn't very imaginative, and that really hardcore 'femdom' porn was rare and hard to find back then. She thought tying me up or working me over with a riding crop was her power fantasy. And I was really lucky that this was the period of the ""Peace Dividend"", the military was paring down by hundreds of thousands, and a junior officer that didn't want any part of a military career anymore could get released early and still get an Honorable. I managed to keep her from knowing it was coming until after I was on 'terminal leave', or she probably would have tried to block it.  I probably would have been transferred soon anyway, or her husband would have, but I just couldn't take it anymore. I'd gotten lazy and sloppy (I was probably depressed, but officers weren't allowed to get mental illness or ask for counseling, and what the hell would I have said, anyway), pulled a bunch more minor writeups in my file, I would have had a hard time making Captain and no chance at all of getting higher, anyway. There was no real attraction to a military life for me.  I got out. I moved on. I tried counseling, I tried support groups (god, what a joke, I got called a liar and nearly thrown out of the first one I tried, only one that would even hear me out was the man-on-man victims, and half of those were gay and tried to hit on me). I tried to drink it away, I tried to fuck it away, I got married, I got divorced. I considered turning gay (turns out it's not a choice, guys don't get me to stand at attention). I considered suicide. No matter who I talked to, I get the same reactions. They don't believe me, or they can't understand how it's even possible for a man to be raped by a woman (news flash, in your 20's a breeze blowing across it can get you hard, even (or especially) if it's the last thing you want). They ask if I had orgasms, they hint or outright say that I must have liked it. Counselors want to talk about my self-emasculating masochistic sexual impulses, probably a result of my childhood abuse, a really high-brow way of saying I must have liked it and I'm lying to myself because I don't want to admit it. I didn't like it. I didn't want it. I'm not able to let myself be actually vulnerable with any woman, which destroyed my marriage and more relationships than I care to count. No matter how hard I try, I never can really trust them with my secrets, and the few times I've tried have made it really clear that is not an irrational fear. Exactly one woman sat through the whole story, then she never spoke to me again. Through mutual friends I found out that she 'just couldn't respect him', she wouldn't tell them why. I put on 50 pounds and quit working out even before I got out of the service, and even though I *know* why I am self-sabotaging that way, when I diet and start exercising, all it takes is seeing some blond MILF checking me out while pretending not to and I'm in a panic to get to Burger King and binge-eat Double Whoppers and milkshakes, back to safety. I'm a male victim of a female rapist. And that is the most pathetic, least respectable, completely unworthy thing to be. And the only advice I have ever gotten about it is boils down to either 'shaking it off', or admitting to myself that I must really like being used and abused, or I wouldn't have 'let it happen'. So, there's my story. I'll admit right now I fudged some of the details to make it nearly impossible to identify me, even if my ex-wife or someone else I've told parts of it to happens to see this, they won't be *sure*. I'm using proxies and a throw-away account, and various other measures that should keep it from being traced. And if ""she"" sees it...screw her, she's not going to control me with fear anymore, maybe she'll even feel shame. I actually do feel better for putting it out there. And I'm going to go ahead and post it, even if it gets deleted right away, that will be closure of a sort. I'll know once and for all, there really isn't anyone, anywhere, that wants to hear it.  edit; I want to thank the people who have said encouraging things. I don't want to get into responding to each one of you individually, not because you don't deserve it but because I don't want to make dozens of posts saying the same thing, like I'm desperate for validation. I just want you to know that I'm reading them, and they helped. I might have been too harsh on my counselors, if I look at it intellectually I know they were trying to help.  I just wasn't in an intellectual place when I was writing that. And I was definitely too harsh on that support group of male victims, they were the only support I got when I needed it most, and the gay couple that seemed like they tried to hit on me probably thought they were just trying to offer empathy and acceptance. Some of them were pretty callous, but the others shushed them and I shouldn't have made it seem otherwise. The support group I went to first was for victims of child sexual abuse, and it was really just one woman (unfortunately the facilitator or whatever they call it) that got actively hostile when I started talking about what happened later, the rest just kind of shut down and stared while she ripped into me (maybe a couple joined the chorus towards the end, after I was angry and yelling back). But I was in a really vulnerable place at the time, and it really hurt a lot that I was rejected and accused like that. Then she started screaming she was going to call the police, and I just kind of freaked and ran out of there. I guess what I hate about this is that it all makes me feel so helpless, and I'm amplifying any disbelief and contempt I get from others because of my own feelings about it. It was that Cracked article that brought it out for me, I felt like I needed to just put it out there, finally say it where nobody could interrupt me, where I couldn't see the looks on their faces before I even got finished. Anyway, thanks.  edit 2; I think some of you don't get what it's like to be in the military. There's not a lot of room in the military for anything that doesn't fall into predictable patterns, the uniform is more than just a set of clothes. It's a mindset, you are a cog in the machine, nothing about you is supposed to stop them from plucking you out of one part of the machine and putting you into another. The rules structure you're in is total and complete, even the ways you can rebel against it have to fit into the right patterns, or you're more trouble than you're worth. That I partied too much and sometimes came to work with no sleep afterwards was against the rules, but in a predictable way, a normal way. They had a method for guiding young officers from thinking of themselves as special snowflakes who didn't have to follow the rules into proper gentlemen, cogs in the machine. And it was working on me, I was straightening up and showing my commitment to the military lifestyle and mindset, getting married, all the things you were supposed to do. I already stood out for reasons I can't explain without giving clues to my identity, there's absolutely no way that I could have salvaged my career and my reputation from something like this. Could I have recorded her in a way to show that I hadn't tried to rape her? Maybe, but remember, this was a long time ago. Camcorders were big, bulky and expensive, even decent tape recorders were neither particularly small nor cheap. And she was married to a lawyer, she knew what she couldn't say out loud, after that first time she never made a direct threat. At best, I would be proving I didn't rape her, I 'just' had an affair with a superior officer's wife (adultery, a UCMJ violation and a court-martial offense in itself). And we'd all just had to go through mandatory sexual harassment training, they'd beat it into us that consensual sex before or after is not proof that rape didn't happen, it still would have been my word against hers, and she'd laid the groundwork to at least make sure that her husband and her friends (again, wives of important officers) would believe her. At best a Special court martial and Other Than Honorable rather than prison and Dishonorable. Still a lifetime of checking ""Yes"" on ""Have you been convicted of a felony"" questions for jobs. And frankly, I just didn't think of it at the time. I tried not to think about it at all, I spent so much time and effort pretending it wasn't happening, or that it was just some kind of casual fuck-buddies thing, that it wasn't happening because she liked having all that power over someone. When I heard about that the early out program had been extended to junior officers, I nearly started to cry. From relief that there might be a way to escape without ruining my life, from fear that it might not work. This was 25 years ago, and in the military, which is always 10-20 years behind the rest of the country. They got dragged kicking and screaming into DADT (which at the time was considered a gay rights victory, gays could finally serve as long as they didn't talk about it), they got dragged into admitting rape and sexual harassment was even something that happened inside the ranks (before that, it was just Fraternization, and both parties were treated as equally guilty). That a man could be 'raped' by a woman half his size? That wasn't even a joke, it would be a big ""DOES NOT COMPUTE"" for the military machine. They simply wouldn't have been able to process the *concept*, I really couldn't at the time. It was years before I could really think about what had happened to me as 'rape'. Like a couple of the commenters have said, it was just ""sex I didn't want or like"", but 'rapists' were always men, weren't they? ""Female rapist"" was like ""cinnamon cow"", a combination of words that has the form of sense, but is nonsense. At *best*, in a perfect world where they believed me completely and her not at all, they would have classed it as sexual harassment, and not a military matter since she was not in service. I quit trying to talk about it, or even think about it, probably 10 years ago. It made me feel so helpless and useless to bring it up, and even the people who believed me never looked at me the same way again. If nobody knew, it couldn't hurt me, right? It wasn't until I saw that Cracked article that I felt like I just had to say something. Even so, I have a career, professional status I need to protect. Maybe we're ready to discuss male victimhood without playing it for comedy, but I don't think most people are ready to actually interact with an actual, known victim without it reducing his stature in their eyes. Certainly not most of the ones that I work with. As for the handful that have posted nasty things, or doubted the truth of it: Fuck you. I've left stuff out, I inserted a couple of false elements to protect my identity (and maybe my ego), and at best I am an ""unreliable narrator"" because this is so hard for me to even think about that it causes the meaning of things, the way I see them, to take on elements of persecution that are probably as much products of my own fear as anything else. I hate looking back at that young man, seeing how hapless and pathetic he was, and having to own that he is me. But the core of it is the truth as best as I can remember it. You can't know what I'm saying is truth. I can't prove it, I won't even put my name on it, and if you want to doubt me, go ahead. But I'm not naming her, there's no need to apply rules of evidence to this because I'm not asking you to do anything. Except maybe consider for one minute that this can actually happen. That you might know someone with a story like mine to tell, that doesn't feel they can. And I never did figure out how she got into my room. Maybe I was drunk enough not to close it properly, maybe she had rigged it with tape or something not to latch, maybe the room next to mine wasn't locked and she came in through the shared bathroom. I never asked her, and she never said. edit 3; This will probably be my last edit before I vanish. I again want to thank the people offering support and encouragement, I've felt very alone with this for a long time and even if it's just words on a screen, it helps. I'm looking into some counseling options, and this time if I don't like how one is going, I'll just try again instead of letting myself get discouraged from even trying. There's a silly but somehow emblematic argument happening in the comments about 'definitions of rape'. I realize that the legal definition of it, and the distinction between various degrees, is important and it's going to be something to work out over the long term. But I think the functional, 'for the purposes of common discussion' definition is pretty easy: If someone coerces someone else into a sexual act through force or threats or drugs, it's rape for all practical purposes. There might be some gray area about the severity of the threats or their nature (suggesting that a grave bodily injury will be inflicted is not in the same category as threatening to commit self-harm or vandalism, for example). But if the performance of the threat will obviously have a grave and irreversible impact on the life of the person being threatened, in and of itself, then it's the same kind of coercion as physical force for any practical purpose. It doesn't matter if you're threatening to end my life, or just my life as I would recognize it.  And the fact that we are having this argument just goes to the point I'm trying to reach here; If I had been a woman, facing the same exact type of coercion, I don't think we'd be arguing over if it was 'really rape' in this setting. There's this assumption that men aren't victims, that are acted on and overwhelmed in the same way that women are, unless the actor is also in possession of a 'Y' chromosome.  I'm not interested in trying to make some kind of grand anti-feminist argument out of that. Nearly everyone in my life up until now, in this thread, has been completely useless in terms of helping me come to terms with this. That the apparatus of victim's assistance and the social awareness of victimization that has ignored me may or may not be dominated by Women's Studies majors really doesn't matter much.  There can be degrees of rape, legal categories of rape, and an argument over what is legally 'rape' and what is 'sexual assault' or 'sexual battery'. But being forced to perform sexual acts for the gratification of another out of fear is rape. Rape is the use of power to force sexual compliance, the form of the power or the precise details of the sex doesn't matter. Trying to hedge that with statements about ""systemic oppression and historical gender power imbalance"" is insulting to all victims of rape, all that matters is the balance of power between the rapist and the victim. In a theoretical matriarchal society women wouldn't stop being victims of the local and immediate power advantage of a male rapist. We've all failed, including me. I could have done more, I could at least have tried to challenge the idea that women can't commit rape, that men are only really 'victims' when the perpetrator of the sexualized assault and coercion was another man. I didn't, never really have, maybe out of fear that it would betray my secrets, maybe because I am just too steeped in the same assumptions nearly everyone has. I'm going to try and do better, and try to get better. Thank you, everyone. edit 4; I was intending to be gone and not come back, I had signed out and was about to turn off the IP masking. But I realized I've got a couple of things left to say; The people who have shared their own stories in the comments (both men and women), the author of that Cracked article, I owe you a lot. One of the hardest things about this is how isolated it has made me in my life. I had this formative experience that seemed so far outside the bounds of normality that it was like I wasn't even part of society anymore. I was pretending, nodding and talking and working and living, like it never happened. When really it was always there somewhere in the back of my mind, steering me and constraining me. Not being alone, knowing that I'm not outside of the human spectrum anymore, that I am still a *person*.... If I get nothing else out of this, that alone was worth it. The other is a final thought on the preconception of 'rapist' as being somehow tied up with being male. It suggests that there's something *more* male about the men who rape. If rape is about power, then men who rape must be more powerful, and if rape is defined by gender than they must be more manly. And the most powerful and manly of all must be the men who rape other men. Who is the 'Big Bad', the embodiment of both power and evil, in a prison movie?  It mythologizes rapists, makes them into these god-like figures, demons of lust, twisted paragons of masculinity. It almost makes them admirable. I can't imagine how anything could be more insulting to victims than to elevate the attackers like that. Or how anything could be more ""reinforcing of rape culture"". That it defines men like me, victims that happen to not fit into the mythology, out of existence? That just makes it worse. Our rapists are women who 'stole the power of men', Promethean perfection of gender role subversion. There's something distinctly sick and wrong about that.",I'm sorry you had to go through that.

39qezv,"I love all the things you’re worried about, because I just fucking dig your body, okay? I just dig the hell out of it. I dig it so much that it turns my blood into fire and I’ve stripped you naked and put you in my bed and put myself in you, because Jesus H Christ are you hot.  And I know you think that when you sit on my face I can see your stomach pouch and when I fuck you doggy it makes your thighs jiggle or your belly sag a bit, and those things are absolutely true. I do notice them. I notice the hell out of them, because they are so fucking sexy. Most of the time we’re fucking I’m watching you /intently/ because that’s like 90% of the fun. I mean yeah okay my dick feels pretty swish inside you and I like the feeling of your cum dripping down my balls - but mostly I love the way that your entire body moves when I push in and out of you; thighs, stomach and all. It happens along with your little hitched breath and the way you screw up your face - it’s ALL a part of the process. One big body language statement on each withdrawal and penetration: “I’m being FUCKED, I’m being FUCKED, I’m being FUCKED” - and that’s so goddamn hot. Because I **wanted** to fuck you, and now I **am** fucking you, and here’s the whole-body proof, every movement and shudder and jiggle and wobble and twitch and JESUS I came, sorry.  Even when it’s not all about the fucking, when you’re sitting on my face - hell yes I have an eye full of belly and hell yes I can grab it with both hands, and that’s ALSO SO FUCKING HOT, because I love your goddamn belly. It’s vital and womanly and round, and it feels fertile and that gets my blood hot when I can squeeze it in my hands as I’m tonguing your cunt. And the girl before you who had no belly, who was sort of toned and slim? I loved her belly too because she made me feel powerful strong when I grabbed her. And all the other girls? I loved each of their bellies being over my face for reasons particular to them all, because I found each of them so sexy as a person that I wanted to take off their clothes and have them straddle my head and grind their genitals into my mouth and lick up what came out. How can you think that I’d want to be in that position and not love every aspect of the view? So just chill out, okay? I know there’s all this pressure on you to have size zero earlobes and you know, the patriarchy is pretty hot on body shaming and that’s awful. But try and take a leaf out of our books. When we 69, do you think I’m unaware that most of the view you have is a little wrinkled ballbag dangling over your face, and possibly my (clean but unarguably unattractive) hairy arsehole every now and then? Do I worry about that? When you’ve told me you’re hot for me and you need me in your mouth and when you’re grunting with pleasure and I’m not even touching you - grunting *just because* you’ve managed to get my dick between your lips. Do you think I take time out to worry about an unappealing view? Do I fuck, love. I trust that you’re enjoying yourself with my body, just as I’m doing the same with yours.  Hope that helps. Kisses xx","I really love this. It's a refreshing perspective from the normal ""don't worry, he doesn't notice all that"" and ""you're beautiful no matter what position you're in"" bullshit.  Thank you. ",826
3ffbdz,"[Link to article](http://abcnews.go.com/US/19-year-spend-25-years-registered-sex-offender/story?id=32783206) This really makes my blood boil. To summarize the article: This 19 year old kid hooked up with this girl via a dating app who claimed to be 17. Turns out she was 14. So he's being charged as a sex offender. In addition to the 90 days he had to spend in jail and all of the zoning restrictions he'll face for the next 25 years: >For the next five years, he is forbidden from owning a smart phone or using the Internet. He is not allowed to talk to anyone under age 17, other than immediate family. He is banned from going to any establishment that serves alcohol and he has to be home before 8 p.m. every night. So basically he has to live in the woods for 5 years. He was going to go into a computer science field. The icing on the cake is that the girl and her mother both feel that this sentence is unreasonable. But: >the judge condemned what he called a culture of “meet, hook-up, have sex, sayonara, totally inappropriate behavior,” according to court documents. So just because this judge doesn't like casual encounters he's going to ruin this kid's life even though everyone else thinks that isn't right. And the Senator of Michigan (where this happened) seems to think that every guy needs to be checking IDs, birth records, and maybe checking in with the state department about their potential partners (exaggeration I know but this is just so ridiculous!): >Michigan state Sen. Rick Jones, who helped write the state’s sex offender registry law, says Zach should have been more careful. “As you grow up, I mean young men are told you know in high school, 15 is jailbait,” Jones said. “Now that’s a slang term, but that’s what young men are told … I would hope that somebody who was 19 years old would say ‘Well do you have a driver's license or something? You don’t appear to be the appropriate age.’” Apparently some states have laws giving guys a break if it can be proven that the girl lied about their age, but not Michigan. What do you think r/sex?

If anyone can provide info on how to let Senator Jones know how you feel, please comment. ",Why can't he go to places that serve alcohol? It's one of the only places that guarantees everyone is over 21. And a curfew? And using the internet!?  And yeah it sounds like the judge is letting his own opinions on when people should have sex affect this ruling and tried to make an example of people that have casual sex.  This guys life is basically ruined. This should never happen in civilized society.,1914
3r90ky,"I am a father of a boy(13) and a girl(15). I told them that it was alright for them to be sexually active as soon as they were ""ready"". I then went on the say what ""ready"" means: 1) mature enough to be open about it.. no sneaking around.. if they're not mature enough to talk to me or their Mom about it, they're not ready. 2) Mature enough to wait until they develop full trust in their partners... start slow and work your way from holding hands and talking to kissing, touching etc. That gives you time to really know your partner, develop trust and a measure of real affection not just infatuation and lust (don't get me wrong.. I'm not putting down lust... it's just not the best emotion for life decisions). 3) Mature enough to understand the need for and to use condoms. 4)  I also told them not to have sex in creepy places like school stairwells or behind the gym.  They have perfectly good bedrooms with doors that lock and their friends will be welcome to stay for breakfast. So am i being too liberal, unrealistically conservative or ""just right""? **[Feedback]** I'm pleased and impressed with how much positive feedback I've received, especially from other parents who have implemented similar approaches and from young people who were raised to be sex positive. I also saw a lot of responses from young people from sex prohibitionist households wishing that they weren't. Thanks all.   **I got gilded!  Thanks kind stranger** **[FAQ]** **1) Isn't 13 too young?**      I didn't say my kids were having sex... I laid out the ground rules for when sex would be acceptable. I didn't tie it to an arbitrary age. I tied it to a level of knowledge, emotional maturity and a commitment to manage the risk. But, that said, I believe that some 13 year olds could be ready for sex.      Children are people.  They have rights.  One of the most important is the right to be treated fairly as an individual.  I can't just draw a line and say “You're too young” .  Justice requires that important life decisions need to be made based on the individual's maturity and circumstances.  Also, to be fair I have to tell my kids what the guidelines are way before they actually need to act on them.  They need to be completely at ease with the framework so that when the day comes... It's a no-brainer.      Also:  There is more to sex than vaginal penetration.  Part of my “Take it slow” precept is that sexuality covers a whole spectrum of activities: Self masturbation, talking, kissing, touching, mutual masturbation, mutual oral stimulation, to anal & vaginal penetration. Somewhere along the spectrum is the suitable relationship for every age and every level of maturity.  I'm trying to give my kids the knowledge (and self-knowledge) to know where they should be on that spectrum.      **2) What about consent?**      I tell my kids that they own their bodies and their partners own theirs too.  Bullying, lies, pressure and making decisions while impaired are forbidden and everyone has the right to change their mind.  However another benefit of the “take it slow” approach is by the time they get to penetrative sex they should know their partners well enough to know if they are consenting.  Also, the “take it slow” approach allows the kids to have sexual pleasure and sexual relief with activities that are much lower risk than penetration:  like mutual masturbation and mutual oral sex.      As you might notice, this pretty much eliminates the “One Night Stand”.  I stand by that.  It takes a lot of social and sexual maturity to make a one night stand a good thing.  I'm not saying it never is, I'm just saying that it's pretty rare unless you travel with a very particular crowd.  And it would be virtually impossible for a teen to have that level of experience and maturity.      **3) What about my children's partner's parents.  Don't they get a say in this?**      They should but the problem here is that I can't let people who think the sex is shameful impose their beliefs on my kids.  Just like alcohol prohibition, it doesn't keep people from doing it.. it just makes them do it in nasty & unsafe ways.          As my kid's relationships develop I would hopefully get to meet their partner's parents before they get to the “sleep over” stage and try to discern their attitudes and wishes.  Also, given the chance, I would suggest to my kids that they should encourage their friends to discuss things with their parents..... but the likelihood of that happening is pretty low if the parents are sex prohibitionist. However, the ""take it slow"" precept can defuse the tension here too because the teens can still be sexual without a sleepover or penetrative sex.      I also expect my kids to be concerned for their partner's health and safety and realize that it would not be kind to put their friends in a situation that would damage their family relationships.  Learning to temper desire with kindness (and common sense) is part of growing up and one reason for being completely open with my kids about sex is so that I can talk about things like that.   **4) Why do parents need to know when their kids become sexually active?**      Kids have rights but they are immature by definition.  They make mistakes.  That's OK, but parents have the job of making sure that their mistakes don't incur permanent injury.  Sexual relationships have risks... some life-altering or actually deadly.  Parents need to know what's going on to help their kids be safe (emotionally and physically) .  My goal is to remove any stigma or embarrassment that would prevent my kids from talking openly to us about their sex lives so that I can keep them safe.      The fact that so many commenters weren't comfortable with that is a testament to the perverse Puritan attitudes prevalent in the US (and a few other places).      You need to internalize this: Safe and developmentally appropriate sexual pleasure is an unmitigated good. People at all ages and levels of maturity should be allowed and encouraged to experience developmentally appropriate sexual pleasure in safe and loving ways. Don't let anyone shame you for doing it or liking it.... not even your parents. CLARIFICATION: There's been a lot of back and forth chats on Parent's need-to-know vs teens right to privacy. Let me clarify my opinion: I am mostly concerned about my younger, inexperienced teens.  My Dad job is to make sure they are safe and happy while they figure stuff out.  As such, I want to know when they first decide to have sex and with who.  I have to help them judge what is appropriate, e.g. Dad would drop the hammer if 15 yr old girl said she was planning to hook up with 24 yr old dude.  I also want them to be physically safe.  That's why I offered the ""locked door"" policy.  I also want them to believe that sex is not shameful, but is just a thing that people do...  An advanced form of ""hanging out"" with your really close friend. As such I want them be totally at ease saying stuff like: ""Dad, [name] and I are talking about having sex, can [he/she] stay over this Saturday?""    However, after a while I don't need to know as much.  Once they are older/more experienced they will have earned the trust to manage themselves.  Ex.  After I've reminded them 20 times about condoms they come back with some teen sarcasm like: ""Dad, I'm not a noob... give it a rest!""  Then I'll know I can stop asking. I imagine when Daughter is 17, I'll come down to breakfast and they'll be a new person at the table. ""Uhh Hi.  I'm [name], I'm [daughter's] friend"" And I won't need to know more than that. ","Perfect. I believe I speak with some authority: My wife and I have been married for 35 years. We raised 2 kids by birth. We also are foster parents, and have raised 19 kids, all long term, all to adulthood. We have had NO unplanned pregnancies NO STDs What you just described is exactly our policy. ",4158
3y1sb2,"Hi /r/sex, I saw a post a little while ago made by a girl who had been approached by a porn agency. She mentioned the name of the agency (Matrix Models) in one of her comments and I sent her a long warning, but she never responded so I decided to post it here, publicly, so that anyone looking to get into porn might benefit from my experience.  To start off, I'm Dawn Brooks ([verification here](https://twitter.com/Dawn__Brooks/status/679889484389863424)), I'm a camgirl and I've done porn in the past. I was contacted by John S (the man who runs Matrix Models) on one of the sites I work on. He promised me tons of money, and since I live close to LA, I was able to give it a shot without risking everything. John does everything himself. He used to have other people work for him but not anymore. I did a few shoots with him, but he never brought up a contract with me. At first he was very professional, but he kept telling me ""I'll have shoots for you the week of ___"" and expect me to plan a week long trip, but when I'd get up there, he wouldn't have anything and it was $900 down the drain. A lot of the other models also warned that John liked to ""take you out to lunch"" or let you ""stay at his 'model house'"" (which was actually his apartment. The one he lived in. There was one other bedroom that had two beds in it. Here's a picture of the bedroom that I took: http://i.imgur.com/tx872gg.jpg) but then, at the end of the month, he'd hit you with a huge bill for the things he bought ""as gifts"" or gas for driving you around. I caught on fairly quickly and insisted on staying in my own hotel and driving myself, and I told him that I wouldn't leave for LA unless he could have a shoot confirmation for me at least 3 days in advance. After telling him that, I didn't hear from him again for months. Every call I made went to voicemail, never answered a text. I finally told him that I thought it was unprofessional for him to abandon me like that and left it at that. I got other jobs myself. A few months later, I noticed my picture was still up on his website. I sent him a text asking him to take it down, and he said **""not until you pay me $3000.""** That was the first he had ever mentioned wanting money from me, and I didn't have a contract with him, so I told him absolutely not. He then told me his lawyer would ""be in contact with me shortly."" Needless to say, as I never signed a contract, I never heard from ""his lawyer,"" and told him that if he didn't take my picture down, I would report his agency to the CA Labor Commissioner. My picture was then removed from his site. **Edit**: Here are the last few texts exchanged between John and myself. Notice the dates: http://imgur.com/a/dGjRQ My story is very common in the porn industry. A lot of people are looking to take advantage of young people looking to make easy money. They will pressure you into doing things you aren't comfortable with and screw you over if you hold your ground. I took a lot of precautions and didn't let anyone bully me, and at the end of the day I decided that porn isn't right for me anyway. Honestly, if you want to get into porn, you don't need an agency. They are a dying remnant of the pre-internet era. It is beyond easy to look up companies, contact them, and book shoots yourself (then you get to keep all of it too.) A few companies to look up if you still want to do this, to start with would be: * Reality Kings * Digital Desire (I did a shoot with them) * Girlfriends Films (I did a shoot with them, Dan is a nice man who has been doing porn production for a VERY long time) * PlayBoy (I did auditions and get contacted for work frequently by them. Amazing company, super professional. ) * Abby Winters  * Devil's Film (They only do B/G stuff, so I never shot with them, but they have a good reputation and their building is nice.) In addition, if you decide to get into sex work, you might be better off doing cam work than porn. Cam work is more flexible and you don't end up tied to some asshole who takes 15% of your earnings and gives you nothing in return.  I hope this story is useful to anyone who wants to go into porn. I'm open to answering questions too. Thanks for reading!",It's really great that you went out of your way and took the time to post all of this good information. I'm sure that it will help others in the future who are considering sex work. Thank you!,1412
4zqe3d,"I recently googled ""men want to be desired"" and I was amazed how little information there is. While women's need to be desired is widely discussed and tons of books and articles focus on that, there doesn't seem to be that much information on men. It could be just me, but I think many men can relate to what I'm going to write here. Women and men are not that different: * **Men want to be desired**. We want to see that, we want to feel your desire for us. We want to know that you want us, that you need us. * **We want to feel attractive and sexy**. A woman says she dresses up for herself, man's attention is a consequence of a short skirt and high heels. That is the image of a sexy woman for most men. What is an image of a sexy man for you? Does he ever get any attention from you because he's dressed nicely? * **We want to hear compliments**. Men are way more emotional and vulnerable than you think. Does he look hot in this suit? He'd be happy to hear that. Anyone would be happy to hear that, no matter what the gender is. * Do not be afraid to point out man's sexuality. Don't be afraid to be dirty. Please, please forget about slut shaming. **You cannot be a slut for finding your husband or your boyfriend hot.** You cannot be a slut for letting him know that you are wet when you think of him doing something. You cannot be a slut for grabbing his dick when he doesn't expect it, he's your SO, in fact, I'm pretty sure he dreams of you doing that. He would touch your ass on any occasion because he finds you hot, why wouldn't you do the same? **Touch him more often than what you think is ""often"".** * Please, please **forget about gender roles and social norms** when it comes to sex. A man not necessarily has to be on top. He not necessarily has to be dominant in bed. It's not his job to initiate sex, you can do it too. A man not necessarily has to be ready to please you anytime you decide it's more ""maybe"" than ""no"". * Those of you who have been cheated on and divorced after years of what you though was a perfect marriage. Did you ever go into detail of what happened? Apart from him being a selfish douchebag and leaving you and kids all alone? What was it that the other woman did? Did she appreciate him? Did she made him feel wanted? Did she compliment him? Did she send him dirty texts, assuring him that she finds him attractive? **Do not forget about your SO**. * Sexually unsatisfied man feels like an unsatisfied woman. Have you ever read at least one post by a sexually unsatisfied man where he expressed his feelings about a dead bedroom? He feels unattractive, unwanted. Have you ever felt this way? **We are not that different.** * **Men want to feel naughty and dirty**. Have you ever received a dick-picture? It's somewhat the same when you bend over in a short skirt for him. Please, react nicely to that. If you were to bend over, do you want a disgusted face or a stupid joke? Women from pornography are always interested in men. We all believe that porn is mostly for men, is this a coincidence? * Something interesting here. Do you know that cross-dressers are mostly heterosexual? If you go and read a little about them, you'd find out that so many of them dress up to feel sexy, attractive and desired. In this case, desired by themselves. They may look funny, but it works for them, that's the image of ""sexy"" they have. **The urge to feel desired is inside men and for some of us, there is absolutely no escaping from it.** * Even more interesting. Have you ever heard that sometimes men imagine themselves being a woman when watching porn? It seems to be more common than you may think. Sometimes it leads to a man questioning his sexuality and making horrible mistakes. Most of the topics on that matter say the same thing: woman is the main character. She gets pleased. **Men want to experience the amount of attention she gets**. Some might watch transsexual porn because of this, they can relate to the main character more, simply because she has a penis. And no, this doesn't necessarily mean he's gay, he's just curious. Please, treat your man like you want him to treat you. We have more emotions than a trashcan. We are not sex machines, we just want to be ""**that guy**"" that you can't stop thinking of.",So... treat others like you want to be treated?,806
5frc3b,"**Background:**   My wife and I are in our mid-20s. We've been together five years and married for about three of them, living together before we even started dating. We share this account, but I (Mr. Easyweeks) will be the author of this post. We will respond to comments/PMs together.      We have a very active and healthy sex life together. Like every relationship, there are surges when we have sex more times in a week than there are days. There are also lulls when we might go a week or more without expressing our lust for each other. In general, we have sex 3-4 times per week, but engage in other foreplay almost daily. We're fairly adventurous and have excellent communication both in and outside of the bedroom. I can't remember how we came up with this game (probably eating breakfast naked on a Saturday morning), but it's been around for about a year and a half now.      ---------------------------------------      **The Game:**   The game is built around these small notes we leave throughout our lives. Each of us writes our own notes on colored paper, and leaves them wherever we want to. If the other finds a note that's on your colored paper, they have to do whatever your note says. The notes are small and folded in a way that they can't be read from the outside, and they're sealed with double-sided tape. There's no way to read the content without damaging the note. The notes sometimes have things that have to be done immediately, and sometimes things that have a time or condition.      There are only a few rules:   1) If you find a note, you must open it on the spot.   2) We each started with 10 notes hidden. Once I find a note of hers, I'm allowed to put another one out into the world. At that point, she has 9 hidden and I have 11. This way, the notes self-balance. The more she finds of mine, the less of mine there are and the more of hers.   3) Be fair. Exceptions are always made to accommodate current circumstances, but we try hard to honor the intent of the notes we find.     **Examples:**   Before we started for the first time, each of us wrote about 15 or 20 notes. That way we would have some extra to put out as soon as we found some of the other's.   Some of the ones she wrote:   *""Sneak away somewhere and take 5 naughty pictures. Send them to my phone.""*   *""The next time we're at a movie, play with me in the dark.""*   *""Come find me and go down on me on the spot, without warning.""*   *""Transform our bedroom without me knowing. Candles, music, lighting, scents, all of it. Make love to me all night.""*      Some of the ones I wrote:   *""Starting right now, you're not allowed to wear underwear for a week.""*   *""Come find me and see how fast you can make me cum, anything is allowed.""*   *""Write a nasty fantasy and send it to me.""*   *""The next time we leave the house, we each have to cum before we can go home.""*   *""Play with yourself until you're dripping wet. Take your clothes off, come hunt me down, put me on the nearest flat surface, and ride my face.""*      **How it plays out:**   The great thing is that, even though we wrote our own notes, we never know when the other will find them. We can hide them in places that are obvious and short-term like in a wallet or under the toothpaste. We can also hide them in places that we know are going to take a while to find, like in the wrong month of a wall calendar or in the battery compartment of a remote control. A lot of times we've forgotten we even asked for what's happening until we're pleasantly (very) surprised!      It kinda goes like this (true story). I'm in the garage working on a project. It's been a couple weeks since I've really been out here working, but it's nice to be in the thick of a wood project again. I'm digging through my toolbox for something and I catch a flash of bright blue tucked in the back. I grin because I *know* that color (her color)... I pull it out of the drawer, tear it open, and read what it says. It's a simple one: ""Come find me and have sex with me somewhere in the house we never have before"". At first I thought to myself that there aren't any undefiled places in our house, but then really think about it. *Every* closet? *Every* hallway? *Every* bedroom? The garage itself? Anyways, I went inside and found her entirely oblivious. She knew I found a note as soon as I took her hand and led her upstairs, but she still didn't know *which* note I found. We fucked on the floor of a spare room that we use for crafts and made a really fun goofy time of it!      Anyways, It never really gets old! Over time the notes have gotten more creative, but we've also reused plenty of them! A couple times people have found one at our house, but they just ask ""what's this?"" and we say ""ah must be trash from something"". I feel like no one would just go opening a piece of scrap paper that was clearly taped shut... I think one time a friend of mine found a blue note. It was secretly amusing to me that someone else unsuspectingly delivered my fate to me...      -Mr Easyweeks      edit: formatting",This is awesome!!! Super creative and very fun.

5i0rju,"I just got asked for ID to buy condoms. I informed the employee that you don't need ID for condoms, she tried arguing with me, so I asked for a manager, who asked me which condoms I wanted. I NEVER give ID for condoms, even though I'm old enough to go into an adult store. I don't let employees of any store think it's okay to require ID. Anyone of any age is entitled to safe sex. Refusing to sell condoms to a minor is just going to encourage non-safe sex. What if I was 16 or 14 and didn't know I could buy condoms at any age?  Edit: I wasn't expecting this to blow up so much. To clarify, this was a convenience store, not an adult shop. At an adult shop, yes they have the right to ID you. Most of the time, they're required to. This was different though. This isn't a standard occurrence, I've bought condoms for years without incident.",This is especially stupid because virtually every place I have shopped that doesn't have the kind of POS where you manually type in every price has an age verification thing that pops up for age-controlled items (mostly to prevent cashiers from forgetting to card when it's required). Condoms never pop for age-controlled in POS systems unless someone codes it wrong.,1270
60pfyr,"First, let me say I love my husband. We've been married twenty years after dating for 3. He's always had a great open relationship with my daughters (18 and 16) until he walked in our younger one having sex. He gave them guy advice and was great with the oldest's Ex-boyfriend. His reaction caught us all off guard.  He was livid, nearly assaulted the boy she was with, and then told my daughter under no circumstances was anyone besides me was  ""getting fucked"" in his household. It's the only time he's cursed in front of any of our kids and we're all still in shock. My husband was supportive of our oldest daughter joining a sorority this fall, but now he told her he's not paying for college if she does. He claims Frat guys are no good.  Here's the thing: He was a frat guy. I met my husband our junior year and my friends told me to stay away from him. I have met multiple girls he's had sex with, and know his old friends joke about him ""breaking a chapter record"" the year he lived in the fraternity house.  He's been an active donor and advocate of Greek life for our kids, but now he's changed his tune. Why?  He's hasn't been any less loving to our daughters, but he's definitely more skeptical of guys being around and told our daughters he doesn't want guys in the house, and that what they do outside of the house is their business but not in his house.  Our daughters are obviously on egg shells around him because they've both had boyfriends, but I don't know why the idea of one of them having casual sex frustrates him. Our oldest is heartbroken because a couple of her older friends are at a specific sorority that she's visited. He's now saying no because he doesn't want our daughter hooking up with ""21 year old Frat assholes"".  He's now totally against it for both of them, but not my son and it's infuriating. Our son is 15 and got caught with the neighbor's daughter and my husband put his arm around him and laughed afterwards. My husband knows our son, who's younger has sex but claims it's different. I'm not saying I want my daughters to spread their legs for anyone, but they have urges too He claims boys at that age think they're unworthy if they're not having sex, and that my son's just proving himself. He justifies it by saying his first time was at 14, and as long as we teach our son consent and respect that he's fine.  It's infuriating because he doesn't want our daughters having sex when he was doing the same exact thing at a younger age and so is our son.  Any advice? We've talked but this has been such a stalemate. It's confusing as well because my husbands always been on the side of feminine issues. He took my daughters to CVS around puberty to buy them feminine products, talked to them about their emotions , but left the sex stuff to me. Why does he care?  VERY HAPPY UPDATE: Hey guys, so he was working from home today and I showed him your reactions. He grimaced, but admitted the people who said it was going to ruin his relationship with our daughters had an impact, as well as the commented who told me he could educate them.  He apologized and talked with me and then we had a talk with as a family. He apologized to me and my daughters for his reaction, the ""getting fucked"" comment. He said it was the heat of the moment and things happened so quickly he just lost it since that conversation was right after he walked in.  We went on to have a very healthy conversation about sex. I lead it at first, but was extremely happy when he told them they were supposed to enjoy sex,want to have it, and that it's their business so he can't be mad. He told them he just wants them to make good decisions. He gave them both advice on staying safe emotionally and sexually. He told my daughters college and their activities in it were there choice. I can tell this was hard for him to say. I think it's a part of him realizing he's going to have to let go very soon and a part of that is realizing our daughters aren't little girls anymore.  I was the happiest when he talked to our son afterwards and told him to not think of it as a game and there's no winning, and that he was honestly too young to be having sex, but that if he was to find someone he can connect with .  He described some of his own family problems our kids didn't know about and stated that it led him down a bad path that hurt a lot of people he was with . He openly admitted to them he was a jerk in college and that seeing his younger daughter having sex was like ""walking in on himself during his own college years"" and scared him. Not going to say he's the happiest right now. I can tell he's  upset because so much just hit him, but he knows he was wrong.  I think the comments about him being a full blown hypocrite were kind of a smack to the face, but I'm glad you guys were rough. I think he realized he had a choice to make and made the best one. My daughters approached me after and seem relieved and much happier about their dad ""not being mad at them"" anymore, so I'm happy. Thank you guys!","My dad freaked out at me about how all men are animals when I was a teenager.  Years later I found out its because he cheated on my mom in college (she already knew this), and THAT'S why he was so set on convincing me men are all assholes who want one thing.  He's got baggage about the stuff he did and he's only now fully understanding/empathizing with the implications of what he did when he was in college. He's probably super mad at himself and scared shitless for his daughters.  He needs to 1) forgive himself - there's nothing he can do now about who he used to be and 2) he needs to get over his anxiety about his daughters. Even if they don't stay in a sorority, MANY bad things can happen to them. That's life. Bad things happen. The key isn't to insulate them from the bad things, it's teaching them how to get back up.",1251

I am not a brand of fuck toy, I'm a human male. Nothing special about my anatomy at all. I do not come pre-fitted with a giant cock just because of my skin color.  Even guys (I'm bi) do this shit and you'd think they would know better! It's so fucking deflating to be vibing with someone, you think you're going to have a great sexual experience with them and then they go ahead and set an expectation you can't live up to.  Free LPT: if you wouldn't walk up to a jew and talk about how cheap they are, you wouldn't walk up to an Asian and ask them a math question, you wouldn't walk up to a gay guy and ask him where his purse is, then don't fucking assume every black male who's ever been born is packing a massive cock in their pants. It's not flattering. Hell, even if I had a massive cock I don't think I'd find it flattering. It's dehumanizing. You're effectively communicating to every black male that's smaller than average, average, or even, in many cases, bigger than average that he's less valuable because of the circumstances of his birth.

6wr7mj,"My girlfriend has a reddit page and a tumblr where she posts nsfw pictures. Most of the time it's just her, but she's posted stuff involving me too. I don't have a problem with her expressing her sexuality or anything like that, but it really can make a guy feel worthless.  My girlfriend has a great body. Nice cheat, flat tummy, nice butt. She also has a pretty face so she's constantly (in real life and online) being positively showered with praise. And the thing I hate about this is comments telling me or her that I'm lucky.  ""You're lucky to be with a girl like that"" ""Tell your boyfriend he's a lucky man"" It's like, well fuck. Isn't she lucky, too?  It especially messes with me when she posts something with me online because I have a pretty unremarkable body. It's just a very average body. No giant dick, no washboard abs, and I've got body hair. So a lot of the time people will outright shame my body in comments or messages to her and it's really difficult to shrug that stuff off.  I know I should just stop looking but it's hard not to. This post was triggered by me looking at her reddit and on her most recent post, which included me, there were a bunch of liked comments talking about how she should leave me for somebody with a ""real dick"" and how it's a miracle I'm with her. Shit makes me want to throw my phone at the wall. It's gotten to the point where I don't know if she's having sex with me because she wants to, or because she wants more content.  As a result of all this I feel like a worthless place holder in the relationship. I feel horrible. I'm going to talk to her about this; I have to. I'm invested in the relationship but I wonder if she is. I wonder if I'm just something safe to do to get her more content and show her a good time. I wonder if she's liked any of the comments disparaging my body. ",TALK TO HER ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL!,9426
6xdoer,"Hi everyone. I am autistic, and of course I know how it physically works, but how exactly is the part before you start making out and stuff? How do you let someone know you are sexually attracted? How do you know someone is sexually attracted to you? And how do you set up a situation where sex happens? I honestly don't have any more knowledge than playground logic, so what I always thought is that you're at the pub, and do some nonverbal stuff, and then you walk away to your place and then into the bedroom. Can anyone explain to me the social part of sex? Edit 18:58 GMT+2 summertime: because someone asked: I am male, 18, bisexual. Edit 18:38 GMT+2 summertime: Wtf this is so weird, I'm on the internet, but people are actually helping me instead of making fun of me. Thank everyone so much❤ Edit 22:03 GMT+2 summertime: ayy lmao this post is banging❤ shout out to everyone, spread love like you always do❤ **cyber group hug** ❤❤❤","Ok I have some time, I'll try.  In a social situation, at a pub with friends or with strangers who are being friendly, if one person (I'm going to narrate this as if you are a man who wants to have sex with a woman. If that's wronng just change the pronouns) ok so if a woman has taken an interest in a man and might possibly want to get physically romantic with him, she would smile at him a lot, more than at others in the group. She might find small reasons to touch him, or ask him for ""help"" with little things. ""oh, I left my card in my car, will you walk with me to go get it and come back?"" She might look for reasons to be alone with or be connected to the man. Like maybe she'd ask you to go with her to get a round of drinks for the group from the bar. She would want to be in closer physical proximity to a man she likes in a sexual way than others. She might sit on his knee when it's crowded and each person doesn't have their own chair.  Now, she doesn't have to initiate all this. If you find a girl you think you'd like to pursue in this way, all of this works in reverse as well (don't sit on her knee, though, most likely. And offering for her to sit on yours should be after you've seen other signs of interest like I mentioned above).  If you enjoy dancing, that's one way to see if she's into you. If she likes dancing with you, looks at you while dancing, smiles, touches you while dancing, those are all good signs.  Now, I'll say right here that NOTHING AT ALL that she does in the bar means you will have sex for sure. Even if she goes home with you, makes out with you, or takes her clothes off, you still need to be prepared for her to not want to have sex, or not want to do parts of sex that you might want to do. She might want to do it and then change her mind. That's how it goes sometimes. Don't get angry, don't beg. Take a deep breath and adjust your expectations.  While at the bar, or outside having a smoke, or whatever, you can see if she's open to more touching. While standing around, if you put your hand on the small of her back, does she move away? If so, that's perhaps a way of saying ""no thanks"".  But let's say you did that, and she moved closer or leaned into you. Depending on what pace you're comfortable and what's normal with your group or the venue, perhaps you kiss her. You can ask first, that's fine.  I'm pretending this went well and she kissed you back. You get her back to your place by asking. If she says no, and you still make sure she gets home safe, the attraction may continue to develop, and, other girls in the group will see you as a gentleman. This could help in the future.

6yicbp,"I (22 F) grew up in the US south in a ultraconservative religious household. Officially, sex outside marriage made Jesus weep. But also my aunt told me, ""realistically,"" that sex is something women do to make men happy. It's not really fun for girls, it's one way to serve your husband, etc. So I never tried because 1) Jesus would weep and 2) it wouldn't be that good anyway so what's the point?  Went to college, changed my mind, left the church, etc. and decided to have sex with my boyfriend this week. Oh. My. God. You fucking guys. I HAVE BEEN LIED TO MY ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE. Sex is supposed to be painful & difficult for ladies? BUT SEX IS GOOD!! Sex is so, so good.  I love it. I love rough sex. I love getting fucked hard-- it feels better than anything in the world. I love being on top, I love him being on top, I love doggy style, I love missionary, I love being fucked against the bed and the wall and the desk and the chair.  And I love giving head! It is not dirty or degrading at all. Gagging is minimal. Semen just tastes like slighly tangy mucus. Oral sex is about pleasure, and fun, and respect, and trust. He puts his most sensitive and fragile part into your mouth (full of teeth that could easily bite and hurt him), you show him you're grateful for the trust. And a dick in your mouth is the best way to start the day!  There's nothing ugly or degrading or shameful about sex. It's like the best parts of dancing and working out and laughing and making inside jokes, all combined. The physical sensations are beyond description, and you get to see the other person at their strongest and most beautiful. You get to share the innermost, most secret, most vulnerable part of yourself with another person-- and be celebrated. You can celebrate someone else's power without being hurt or diminished yourself. I will never, ever stop having sex, and I will never, ever feel ashamed about it.    Virgins, take warning: sex is GOOD. EDIT: Wow, this went up fast! To everyone who said ""You made my day"" (or variants thereof): awww, I'm glad! I was just real excited to share my discovery with something.  To everyone advising safe sex: Yes. Yes, absolutely. I'm on the pill and we're looking into an implant/IUD.

785bkv,"So I matched with a girl on tinder earlier today. One thing led to another and I ended up going to get her and bringing her to my apartment. At first we just chilled, smoked, and talked. She was saying how she liked me and was into me, but that she didn't want to hook up. I was a little annoyed but whatever because she was cool and I was liking her too. So maybe this would be a situation where you end up dating somebody off tinder. Who knows. So we talk and talk and end up getting closer and closer together.  So eventually we ended up making out but she was like ""I just want to kiss and cuddle I don't want to hook up.""  Again, that's fine.  So at this point were going between making out and watching movies. And we were in my living room on the couch. So I was like let's go to my bedroom. Again she was like she didn't want to hook up. And I told her I just wanted to go there because it's way more comfortable.  And it is. Like my couch is stiff af.  So she said we wouldn't do anything more than making out and cuddling. This is fine by me because I'm starting to like her and I think she feeling the same way about me. So we go in there and after a while she starts touching my crotch and stroking me through my pants. So at this point I'm remembering she said she didn't want to hook up and this level of teasing is too much. So I was like I thought you said you didn't want to hook up. She says I don't I just want to give you head. I'm never gone turn that down so then she went down on me. After a while I told her I'm about to cum and she stops.  So I'm just kinda sitting there like...what's wrong?  And she legit looks upset about something and then asks me to take her back to her apartment. I'm confused but whatever. I take her back to her apartment and before she gets out she kisses me.  So I'm getting all these mixed signals like wtf is going on with her?  Whatever. I'm just gonna go home jack off and call it a day. So as I'm driving away I get a text that literally just says ""I'm transgender"". So my dumbass just sends back ""Hi Transgender, I'm Ben."" But she thought that was hilarious and then went into saying how she didn't want to tell me in my apartment because of how some people would react.  So I just was texting her back and forth saying how I'd never done anything with a transgender person but I was liking her. I mean I was making out with you before and I liked it so I guess I dont care. So after I told her that she said in that case can you come get me again? So I went and got her and when we got back to my apartment we basically just started making out and getting naked like instantly.  So we're stripping down and making out and everything and she goes ""I understand if you don't want to do anything with my dick. It's cool.""  So in my head I'm like breathing a sigh of relief because I didn't know how I was going to handle that. But then shit went on. And I was like so into her and the sex was soooooo good that eventually she was going down on me and stroking herself and I just couldn't take my eyes off her dick.  She saw me and asked me what I was looking at and then I basically sucked her dick.  So the rest of what happened doesn't matter but basically she's sleeping next to me right now and I'm sitting here tripping because I just sucked a dick. I got turned on by a dick. And I know this is a girl and all hut still. I can't shake the thought that I had a dick in my mouth.  So I'm just confused right now and I would appreciate any of yall weighing in.

One thing gave me pause and it was that this guy is really, really physically attractive. Stereotypically so. Literally tall, dark, handsome. If I met him just out in the world and he told me he modeled, I'd have believed it.  So then some of the most emotionally gut wrenching sex happened. He just coudln't get out of his head. The best way I can describe it was like he was cramming for a test tomorrow and he already knee he was going to fail that class. He wanted to do well so badly. It wasn't so much awkward as it was heartbreaking. Eventually, after me trying to co fort him and coach him, he just got off of me, sat on the edge of the bed for a minute, and started to cry and tell me I could go. In that moment, i felt this overwhelming sense of sorrow. What he was feeling was so authentic and painful that I knew I had to be there for him. I scooted up next to him and held him. He asked me to please let him go and he said he felt worthless and like a loser. I sat there and told him that I would leave if he really wanted me to, but that I would really like if he spoke to me about what he was feeling. At this point I was crying so I think that made him feel more comfortable. He told me that he was raised religious, didnt say which, and that he was trying to wait until he was married for sex. He said he was recently in a year long relationship where it eventually came up and his religious gf broke up with him. It got back to him that she did it because of his lack of experience.  He said he felt sex was ruined for him. That it was tied to him feeling inadequate and like he wasn't a real man with any value. He said that everyone his age learned how to have sex 10 years ago and that he was waiting for a woman who wasn't waiting for him.   His plan was to pay for sex. He was going to keep going from sex worker to sex worker to build some experience but that he ended up just hating himself the entire time he was trying to have sex with me. Before I could respond to him, he hurried and put his clothes on and left. He gave me a very suicidal vibe and i must have called him more than 50 times. Sent like 10 texts. Idk why but i just felt so scared for him. Still haven't gotten a response. I dont even know this guy and i feel so scared and sad for him. Such a heartbreaking story.

But despite men having tried for lengthy amounts of time and all sorts of techniques I had never cum from ""just"" oral. I at least always had to be fingered or something at the same time.  I honestly thought it just wasn't possible and it kind of made me sad. Other women *love* oral, most of the men I've been with have been enthusiastic about eating me out, but I always just felt sort of like I could take it or leave it. *Holy shit* It was some goddamn black magic cunnilingus going on down there. I would think ""a little to right"" open my mouth to say that and BAM the man was already doing it. It was like he was telepathically communicating with my vagina. I didn't think I was going to cum, but it felt great, then all of the sudden I felt *it* building. My hips started to buck like normal, so he held me down and started going faster and harder and making yummy noises and I just came, SO HARD.  I swear to god I almost started fucking crying. Instead I started laughing like a crazy person and literally said ""what did you just fucking do to me?""  Suffice it to say a whole new world has been opened for me. Friends, women, men trying to make a partner cum, I tell this tale to let you know that IT IS POSSIBLE.  He made me cum with his mouth four more times this weekend... for science. I had to make sure it wasn't a fluke. It is decidedly not.   ","You marry him. Also, GREAT!  Now I want head and my partner is at work.  Just GREAT! /s",1030
7ir5wp,"Met this guy off tinder for drinks.  He ended up exceeding my expectations tenfold. He was so ridiculously cute and charming in person. Not in the sweet talking way though.  Super intelligent, interesting, kind of shy but witty too.  I suggested we head back to his place after and he seemed a bit reluctant about it - said he likes to take things slow. I figured he just wasn't vibing me the way I was him.  So we went to a different spot and had a few more drinks and he decided we could go to his place after all.  Things led to sex and it felt so natural and intimate even though we had just met each other. Slow, hand holding, lots of eye contact, super passionate.  Afterwords we snuggled and chatted until we fell asleep.  Woke up to him pulling me closer and playing with my hair and caressing me really softly.  He made me coffee and we snuggled some more and when I went to call a taxi he insisted he drive me home instead.    I'm just so conflicted about these emotions right now - it was the kind of sex you have with a long term partner.  I've had a fair amount of hookups in the past year of being single and never caught any feels, but here I am all day not being able to stop thinking about last night after only a few hours of knowing this person. Its a weird/scary feeling - I don't think I've connected this well right off the bat with anyone in my entire life. *Edit: I didn't expect things to blow up like this! I haven't heard back from the text I sent yet but that's okay, it was pretty late when I sent it and it's still kinda early here. He seems like the type of guy who will respond whether it's good news or bad news. I'll let y'all know!* *Edit: We hung out again. He didn't seem as into me, kinda distant. He texted and said sorry, it's because he's talking to his ex again and they're probably getting back together.  I'm pretty bummed but it's okay. Thanks for being so invested in my love life strangers!*",Same thing happened to me. I texted him after he left.

We have a 6 year old daughter. Now this may not be sexual, and some laugh and don't under stand but about 90 percent of the time my wife and I shower together and maybe 5% of that time together is it ever sexual. Its a small stand up shower with a bench built in to it. During our showers, one may shower and the other sit or ill sit on the floor and she will sit on the bench. Dur8ng this time in a hot relaxing shower we have our best conversation. I love washing her body, massaging her and just talking about her day.  This little time together means so much to her and brings us closer. Its nice to do something so intimate yet be something non sexual. I look forward to it every day!

7qj438,"tldr: A girl didn't tell me she was a virgin. She ended up making a fool of herself and made my penis hurt for several days. I see so many posts here from embarrassed virgins asking whether they should tell their partner they are a virgin. I hope this story will illustrate why you should tell your partner. I [22M] was having sex with a girl from Tinder last week. I didn't realise until halfway through that she was a virgin. She was very shy.  * She wanted the lights off (setting the dimmer to the lowest setting was still ""too bright"").  * She refused to let me go down on her during foreplay I thought 'meh, ok'. I know some girls are shy, and some genuinely don't like receiving oral. So then we start with PIV. I grab a condom and some lube, and she starts freaking out about lube and asking whether it's safe. I've had some girls react slightly odd about using lube for PIV (the extra-thin condom brand I like gets quite dry. It's *not* because the girl isn't wet enough), but this girl was worried because she'd never even *heard* of lube before. I tried explaining that it's *safer* to use lube, because condoms only ever break if you *don't* use lube. But she was still scared. Once we started getting into PIV, it was *horrible*. She wouldn't thrust up/down the penis (coaxially along the shift, in/out the vagina), she was thrusting in the direction from my head to my toes (radially relative to the shaft, from her belly button to her back), which was *bending* my penis. I know that when girls are on top (in cowgirl position), most like to thrust forward and back a *little*, but this was excessive, and it *hurt*.  I kept trying different positions, but she kept thrusting in the same way.  She also liked to keep penetration shallow, so I'd sometimes pop out, and then she'd come down hard on my shaft (missing the hole), like stubbing a toe. That *hurt*! And if you do that too hard, you can literally *break* a penis. (It makes a 'pop' noise) I don't want a broken penis, so I tried instructing her to thrust in/out. (It took all my self control to suggest it kindly, while I was screaming internally ""what the fuck do you think you're doing?"") It took many attempts at explaining.  Once she understood that, she started thrusting in the normal *axis*, but 100% out of time. So when I'd thrust into her, she'd move her body *away* from me. When I pulled out, she'd move her body towards me. So I wouldn't actually go in and out. (I asked, and it wasn't because I was going too deep or too hard) Without relative motion, there's no friction, so no pleasure. At this point my penis still hurts, and there's no way I can come without relative movement. So in my fed up state, I ask (as kindly as I can) > Me: haven't any of your other partners told you about this? > > Her: No > > Me: Have you had any other partners? Am I your first? > > Her: Yes I wish she told me earlier! It would have all made sense. I would have taken things even slower, and given her more guidance earlier on. She would have felt more comfortable, and I would have been able to get off. It could have been a memorable night for all the *right* reasons. Instead, she didn't get off, and I'll remember her as the girl who almost broke my penis because she didn't know what direction to thrust in. The lesson here is: tell you partner if it's your first time! It will be more embarrassing if you don't As a side note: The fact that I only realised she was a virgin because of her *behaviour*, not her *body* tells you that all that incel dogma about virgins being magically tighter is simply bullshit. Having lots of sex doesn't make a pussy looser. (Gasp! What a total surprise /s) Edit: 6 years on reddit, and when I finally get gilded, it's on a burner account. Ha.

7sqdqh,"So in response to the fantastic post about guys not going down on women, I feel like chiming in after 10 years of sex work where my mouth and nose has been many places.  Firstly, when I'm with a woman who is not my real lover, I am not used to her natural smell. It's not usually bad, but yea, if it's a professional hook up, I don't want to smell ANY SMELL and I really don't want to taste ANY taste.  So I make sexy time by both of us washing each others labias. Did you know that labias can often contain smegma? It's not like a mans smegma but you literally have to open your labia wide open and wash it off.  Even after a woman claims to have showered before, I will sometimes have to scrape it gently off with my finger. Again, with my lover, a different story.  I personally don't want to have any scent for my clients so my personal routine is I use Dove unscented soap and VERY carefully wash the inside of my outer labia. That is where I smell the natural scent of a woman and that is where mine comes from.  As we all know, the vagina doesn't smell. If it does, that's trouble. I am very sensitive to UTI's so I take 10 solid minutes to avoid my urethra area and clit and ONLY get the labia.  From older clients, I have had complaints that I no longer smell and they enjoyed my natural aroma. For me, that was a bit too personal for a hook up so I like it this way now.  For men, I do the same for uncircumcised penis. There is often hair, small amounts of smegma and mostly underwear fuzz that I do not want in my mouth.  So far, no one has been offended at my mutual cleaning. We should all be mature enough to open each others genitals and clean them together. I would not allow anyone to use soap on my labia and I don't do it to them but I will recommend my routine.  The same goes for a man's penis and soap. But thorough washing is essential. If you all have to lay in a bathtub to do it, then do it.  I am not saying that genitals are gross and bad. With my own lover, I revel in their natural scent and prefer them unwashed actually. I love the taste of THEIR skin oils and even their B.O.  Lastly, if you are not using a bidet, I can smell your ass. Clean ass after using toilet paper still smells like feces often. Male and female alike. Use water on your ass after a bowel movement if you don't want primal play. Curiously, with my own lover, I lean very primal and don't mind the scent at all.  That all said, yes, when I encounter a woman or man who is not my lover, I really don't want to smell your vulva or your cock/balls.  Please don't be shy and don't worry about breaking the mood. Laugh a little. C'mon, we can all be open and say hey, I want you but I need to wash up first.  Lovers who don't hook up, your natural smell is a huge turn on for each other. Don't stress about a shower after yoga...hell, I prefer you didn't!!  Sorry for the rant but I just had to. Enjoy this sexy day, all! ","“As we all know, the vagina doesn’t smell. If it does, that’s trouble.” Your article was very good but I think you meant to say this a little differently. Maybe something more like “The vagina doesn’t smell *bad*. If it does, that’s trouble.”",1195
7xqoof,"I spent the majority of my childhood being sexually abused by my father. And as I got older, I became susceptible to being taken advantage of. The first time I had sex as an adult, I was raped. And after that I was sexually assaulted several times more. At the end of it all I didn't have any self esteem. My ability to love was hindered. I thought love = sex.  When I met my fiance a little over a year ago, I learned how to love. But it wasn't without its obstacles. And because of my past, I'm hypersexual and insanely kinky. So is my partner, so we're a great match. But the one thing that was always a sore spot for me was that I had never made love before. I know it's cheesy. But I didn't get to decide my first time. It wasn't special, I wasn't safe with someone I loved. And that's just the way it was. Last night I took a bath, and when I got out, I walked into the bedroom and cried. There were rose petals everywhere, candles lit, my favorite music playing And we made love. Most special night of my life. Edit: thank you everyone for the kind words and the gold!! ive been having a tough time lately and all of your comments and messages really made my heart swell :') ",Awwwww this is so cute and adorable I'm glad you are happy and your fiance loves you good luck to you two <3,637
7z96e9,"The title pretty much sums it up, but here's the details: I have a long time friend, recently turned FWB. He's poly and one of his occasional sexual play partners is a professional dominatrix who's been teaching him the ""art"" of spanking. Last night we're fucking, having a great time and getting a little aggressive. He's spanking me here and there, but nothing super focused. We finish that round and we're lying there and he looks over at me and says ""have you ever been spanked?"" To which I responded ""yes, I believe you were there too."" He goes ""no, I mean just spanked, not fucked, just spanked for about 20 minutes or so with no other sexual stimulation?"" I had not and folks I definitely wanted to try it. Before this I'd just been lazy spanked. I have a fairly spankable ass if I say so myself and I've gotten swats here and there, once a bruise, but mostly it's been mid-coital ass slappage. UNTIL LAST NIGHT.  He flipped me over and just started lightly back and front handing my butt cheeks. In different areas of my ass. Then he would lightly drag his finger tips across the part he had slapped. As the spanks got harder and harder those finger-tip drags felt better and better. Hard slap, tiny buttcheek kiss, harder slap, light fingers over the same area. For about 15 minutes. He'd check in every few spanks to make sure I was doing okay. As the spanks increased so did the endorphins surging through my body, I got wetter and wetter until I was basically dripping. My ass was completely red, hot and sensitive and when I finally tapped out, he said he was barely spanking me, my ass was just now so fucking sensitive. The session ended with lots of sweet kisses. I felt oddly cared for. To have someone that focused on your body, your reactions and essentially your pleasure in a way that had nothing to do with genitalia was so fucking unusual and hot. Then he felt how wet I'd gotten and we fucked like it was going out of style....and every time he grabbed my overly sensitive ass a whole new wave of pleasure and endorphins were released.  Holy fuck my friends that was some bananas good fuckin. Note: there's a technique to building up to the harder spanks and different ways of spanking. He really worked up to it and it prevented lots of bruising (there were a few marks this morning, but nothing like I imagined there would be) and I am totally able to sit today pain-free.  Moral of the story, if you know someone who's into spanking, let them spank you...just spank you. Who knows, you may end up soaking wet (or rock hard) and begging for more. EDIT to say: I feel like there are other applications for this type of sexual stimulation. Anyone with experience in this have ideas about other ways to explore this? TL;DR: I done got myself spanked, just spanked for about 15 minutes and it was one of the hottest experiences of my life.

7zmkfr,"I've noticed several posts lately that concern men who are desensitized, cum too quickly during sex, or have trouble getting or maintaining erections. I believe that for those posters, their problems may stem from improper masturbation. As someone who used to have these problems, I thought I'd weigh in and write a guide that I can share instead of writing the same comment over and over. In this guide I will lay out some rules for masturbating, the details of how to follow those rules, and finally the theory behind why the rules matter. I imposed these rules on myself and I experienced the following benefits: * **Increased ability to get an erection with a partner** * **Increased staying power** * **Better orgasms** * **Better feeling during PIV** These benefits form a positive feedback loop. Once you start seeing benefits, your confidence will grow and you will only see increased benefit. A few things to clear up first: * This guide is aimed at penis-havers who want to improve their sexual performance   * A lot of this guide also applies to women, but since I think these problems tend to affect men more often, I have aimed the guide at them. * This guide discusses sexual dysfunction, but it is aimed at men who can achieve full erection and orgasm naturally (""all the pipes work"") * This guide is what worked for me, and is totally my opinion. I don't claim for it to be *correct* or *the only way to do it* * I'm not against pornography, but have reservations about its overuse * If you don't follow this guide and still have a great sex life, that's great! I'm happy to hear it  The Rules ====== 1. **Use lube always.** 2. **Never masturbate for less than 10 minutes at a time.** 3. **Only masturbate when you are already horny.** 4. **Treat porn as a luxury, not a necessity.** The Details ========== 1.  **Use lube always:**    You should never masturbate without lubrication. You can start dry but once you're erect it's time to get wet. I recommend coconut oil, or whatever other lubricant you would use when having sex. Be generous with it - really grease that pole. 2. **Never masturbate for less than 10 minutes at a time:**   Make it a marathon, not a sprint. If you can't make it to 10 minutes of full stimulation without cumming, then you need to **ease the fuck off** and edge yourself or stop completely until you are calm enough to continue without cumming. Change your grip, use a light touch, ease off the porn, do whatever you have to do to get to 10 minutes. After that you can cum whenever you like. 3. **Only masturbate when you are already horny:**   You should never masturbate just because you're bored. Watching porn to get horny first does not count. 4. **Treat porn as a luxury, not a necessity:**   just because you *have* porn doesn't mean you *need* it. Occasionally practice masturbating just with your imagination. If you find it impossible to become erect or achieve orgasm without pornography, you might want to check out ~~r/NoFap~~ (EDIT: r/PornFree). The Theory ======= The driving principle behind these rules is this: **treat masturbation like training for sex** 1.  **Use lube always:**    This one is simple. Good sex is wet. Dry sex is not good sex.    When you use lube, you are mimicking the kinds of sensations you can expect during sex. You will find that it feels better than going dry, and is all around more natural.   When you jerk off dry, you are training your brain to respond to dry stimulation. This causes desensitization because it is very rough compared to a vagina. **This makes sex less enjoyable** because you are used to harder stimulation.   Paradoxically, jerking off dry also makes you **cum sooner during sex**. Your body isn't used to the wetness, and this puts your mojo off balance, making you last shorter.  2. **Never masturbate for less than 10 minutes at a time:**   Many men masturbate like a firework - they shoot up and up and up and explode a minute later. Then, when they are having sex, they do the same thing! You might call it ""rubbing one out"", but I call it **premature ejaculation**. You can't expect to last long during sex if you are racing to the finish line every time you jerk off!   You need to train your body to treat all sexual activities like a marathon, not a sprint. Just like a marathon, this will be **difficult** for beginners. It is hard to maintain the stamina and self control needed to hit that 10 minute mark. Just like a marathon, you **do not need to go full force the whole time!** You can take breaks, go slowly, even remove stimulus entirely. All that matters here is that you are staying aroused for the full time. As you gain confidence and awareness of when you are about to cum, you can ratchet up the intensity until you eventually hit a full 10 minutes of stroking.   Another thing to mention is that **masturbating longer makes masturbating better!** You will cum harder and with more volume the longer you stay aroused.   Once your body is accustomed to being horny for longer periods of time, you will have more confidence during foreplay and intercourse, and more staying power. Your partner will also thank you for sticking around! 3. **Only masturbate when you are already horny:**   This rule is all about equating pleasure with horniness and nothing else. If you masturbate just because you are bored, you are hitting your brain's pleasure centers with nothing but the act itself to focus on. You are mindlessly pursuing pleasure. **This makes sex less special.**   You want sex to be special because you want to get the most out of it. Think about the object of your desire. Maybe it's that cute girl with heart-shaped ass who lives in your building. Maybe it's the nice perky tits on the last woman you had sex with it. You want the object of your desire to be something real and worth working for. If you cheapen it by hitting the orgasm button when you aren't even horny, then your body won't try especially hard when you do get the chance. 4. **Treat porn as a luxury, not a necessity:**   Porn is the worst best thing to happen to sex. If you're already horny from fantasizing, then actually seeing something in a picture or video can make you go wild. However, porn is a mood-altering drug, and it can become addictive. It can become a crutch. If you become reliant on porn, you are in for a **rude awakening** when you have sex.   Porn-Induced Erectile Dysfunction (PIED) is a real thing, and it *SUCKS*. Imagine one night you're jerking off and you're hard as a rock. Then, the next night, you finally bring home that girl with the ass from (3) and *you can't get hard with her*. WTF?! You know all the plumbing works, and her ass is so hot you can fry an egg on it! What's wrong?    Sex is more of a mental thing than many guys give it credit for. Your dick might be a 7 inch cum cannon but your brain is the one that has to load it. So, when we use porn every single time we masturbate, we are training our brains to become aroused with this **great big visual stimulus** right in front of us. It becomes a crutch.   That's not to say that you should swear off porn. Porn is not in and of itself unhealthy. It's how you use it. Think of it like alcohol. It's great and healthy to get drunk occasionally and have a great time! However, if you are doing it all the time, and find that you can't have fun without drinking, then you have a problem. It's all about moderation.   How do you know if it's a problem? Just try to masturbate with no porn. If you can get all the way erect and cum without any porn, just your imagination, then you are healthy! If not, you should consider why you can't do it and whether you think it's a problem.   If you do find yourself reliant on pornography, I highly recommend ~~r/NoFap~~ (EDIT: r/PornFree). They are a supportive community with lots of information on how to deal with this problem.  Conclusion ======= I just want everyone to have the best sex lives they possibly can. I think that starts with correct practice when you are alone. Masturbating is the best way to get fully in tune with your body and learn your limits, but if you do it incorrectly you can end up adversely affecting your sex life. Following the rules and theory I have laid out here should increase your confidence and stamina, which drives a positive feedback loop that leads to sexual performance! There it is, that's my guide! I hope you found this collection of my personal insights to be helpful with whatever problems you may or may not have. I welcome any comments and criticism, and of course, would love to see this shared. Just remember that this is all my opinion, and I don't claim that it is the right way or the only way. Thanks for reading and Happy Fucking! Edit === This post has attracted a lot of attention and several good points were brought up in the comments. I will address them here since there are too many to address every single comment. Assumptions ---- I originally didn't realize I was making several assumptions. Let me address them here: * **I assumed a circumcised penis:** I was circumcised as a child so I have very little context for how it feels to masturbate or have sex as an uncut man. From the comments, it seems that the foreskin provides natural lubrication, probably enough for our purposes here. Whether you use lube on the outside is up to you, though I do say it's worth a try.   For those you are uncut, please realize that some circumcised men do masturbate without lubrication, and it involves a lot of friction. I stand by my statement that circumcised men should definitely use lube.  * **I assumed visual pornography:** When I used the term ""porn"", I meant pictures and videos. I don't have a lot of experience with erotica or audio erotica, so I can't make an informed opinion about them. I think the visual aspect of pornography is probably the most effective and possibly reliance-inducing aspect. Concessions -- Here are some things that after reviewing the comments I realize might not make sense. * I said that rubbing dry can cause you to cum more quickly during sex. I think this is not a universal case, and its just my personal experience. Even my experience with it could be biased, so YMMV. * I gave a shoutout to r/NoFap. I personally used their ""rebooting program"" and I found it helpful, though I didn't really dive into comment threads. Upon inspection, it appears that r/PornFree is a more suitable community to go to for guidance about porn-specific problems. FAQ -- * **Do I need to use lube? What kind should I use? It's so messy!**   The aim is to be *sliding* and not *tugging*. If you are circumcised, you should use lube. Period. As for what kind, there are lots of possibilities:   * Coconut oil - the same kind you cook with. I buy it in a jar, and that jar will last me several months. Coconut oil is also great for massage and lubrication during sex. It's really just great all around   * Soap / body wash - if you do it in the shower, that's fine by me! Just don't use straight water!   * OTC / sex shop lubes - these do exactly what they say on the tin. My GF and I like WET Platinum Strawberry   * Vaseline and lotion - never used them myself but probably fine    * This list is by no means exhaustive * **What do you mean by 'horny?'**   I mean you have an urge to fuck! You have something in mind that turns you on. This rule is mostly designed to keep you from cheapening the experience by masturbating out of boredom, or from doing it at a set time (like right before you sleep every night). If you *are* horny right before sleep, by all means go for it. * **If I am trying to simulate sex, shouldn't I be using a condom?**   That's not a bad idea. If you do use a condom, lubricate both sides of it. You don't have to use one every time. * **Is there a version for women?**   I'm not a woman, and my GF doesn't flick her own bean very often, so I don't see such a guide coming from me  Redditor's Notes -- Wow this post blew up! RIP Inbox! Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!",You recommended r/NoFap but I think r/pornfree would be more applicable. They're less extreme and more focused on decreasing porn-use instead of demonizing masturbation.,1037
827dm7,"I'm in my 60s, which makes me older than nearly everyone here.  I've been reading posts here for a while (never too old to learn something), and want to offer a few things I've learned 40+ years of sexual engagement.  Apologies in advance if this is boring. 1.  Porn is not real life, unless porn is your career.  You aren't a porn star, and it's wrong to expect that your spouse/partner is.  If you're both into it, fine, but if one of you isn't then back away from the porn before it ruins your relationship. 2.  Work out your preferences, kinks, fantasies and other expectations BEFORE you become engaged or married.  Agree ahead of time what you're okay with, and more importantly, what you're not willing to do.  Wanting to bail on a marriage five years into it because you've just decided that your wife should do gangbangs but she doesn't want to is just a stupid thing. 3.  Monogamy is erotic, if you make it so.  It takes work and open communications, but it's possible and good.  4.  Very few people are wired for threesomes, group sex, swaps, etc.  Very. Few.  Those who are tend to be waaaay over-represented in forums.  Don't think that it's typical or simple behavior because you read about it all the time.  If you and a partner are going to try it, do it before you marry so you don't wind up wrecking a marriage in the aftermath.  And know before you begin exactly what the risks are. 5.  Get married if you want regular, dependable sex.  Work out in advance where your libidos are set, high medium, or low, and make sure you are are compatible.  6.  Then keep yourselves in shape and attractive.  Bathe, groom, and dress like adults.  Work out.  Eat just enough to maintain energy and not get fat.  Stay interesting.  Read books.  Talk about ideas. Make plans together.  Share in the work around your place.   7.  ""She's got great boobs, we're going to get married"" and ""Wow, he's got tats, abs and a nice dick"" may be the two worst reasons humans can think of to get married.  That stuff all changes over time.  Think hard about what a good marriage looks like 20 years down the road and aim at that. 8.  Note that I said married, I didn't say living together.  Marriage takes courage and commitment, something a person you love deserves.  It's erotic.  Living together means one of you is going to bail as soon as something better comes along.  You can't build on that. There's no equity, no romance.  EDIT:  Women view living together as a steppingstone to marriage, while men view it as a way to avoid marriage, so there's a baked in conflict.  Link to essay that cites several studies about living together vs. marriage.  http://wingnutwatch.typepad.com/marriage/2010/10/research-findings-that-show-cohabiting-couples-break-up-at-much-higher-rates-than-married-people.html 9.  Learn the art of excellent quickies.  Say you're working, you've got kids, etc., and the hours long bang-a-thons you had before kids are now few and far between.  Don't despair, quickies are terriffic.  In bed, in the shower, in the kitchen, at odd times when you're together briefly, and so forth.  They are a great way to remain sexually connected with each other. 10.  If one of you loses interest in sex, talk talk talk talk and then talk some more.  Don't accuse, don't demand, don't issue ultimatums.  There is a reason or there are reasons for losing interest, find them and treat them accordingly.  11.  Never yell (except in delight).  If you are going to yell, stop, walk away for a while and ask yourself why.  Start with your own expectations and move from there.  Yelling causes an argument, someone has to lose any argument, and you sure as hell don't want yourself or you partner to spend the next week or month feeling like a loser.  That kills relationships. 11.  You didn't invent sex.  Weird, right?  Humans have been having sex with each other since there were humans, some 250,000 years ago.  Oral isn't new,  anal isn't new, orgasms (or their lack) aren't new.  Multiple partners aren't new, one-nighters aren't new. Jealousy isn't new.  Being gay or bi isn't new.  In fact, until about the early 1900s sex was usually in conditions you'd not like.  People were usually covered in dirt, shit, sweat, fleas, flies, ticks, hair, grease, etc.  No tampons or pads. No soft beds, no soap, no waxing, no mood lighting, no tubs and showers, no Barry White music, no air conditioning, no condoms, no UTI prescriptions, no yeast infection prescriptions.  We're lucky that our ancestors were diligent, all because sex is good!","This is definitely NOT boring.

83sj20,"... Stop.  If you have a question that starts this way, the ultimate answer is always going to be that it depends on the person you're having sex with. Questions like this pop up on this sub aaaall the time and the answer is always the same. Some people like it, some people don't, you can either ask the person you're with if they enjoy it or just roll the dice and find out. Most of the time there's no right or wrong answers anyway :) Edit: I've been reading through all your comments over the last day or so and I've found that some of you agree with me, some of you disagree with me, and it's about 50/50 between the two. I feel like you've all adequately proven my point - good job reddit!  Also, a few people have hit me with the, ""if you don't like what someone is posting, just don't comment"" comments. Because they don't like what I'm posting. So they comment. Amazing stuff","I like that /r/sex is a community where young people feel comfortable asking these questions. Yeah it gets repetitive, but I honestly don't mind. A lot of people grow up in very sex-negative environments and need help feeling comfortable in their own skin.

84xdzj,"So my 14 year old son and I had a great conversation yesterday. I was worried because every time I would talk to him about sex, he would remain quiet and wouldn't engage.  My biggest fear wasn't him having sex, but him not being able to talk to me about it and learn.  So yesterday I took it a step further than usual and started talking more explicitly about sex. I put everything on the table, hoping that he would understand that there is nothing he could say to upset me or be embarrassed about.  I'm happy to report this worked better than I could have ever imagined. He was comfortable enough to ask me questions about things he didn't understand, mostly stuff his friends said.... which guess what, most where incorrect. He was comfortable enough to discuss porn and I was able to comfort him and let him know that porn is not ""real sex"" and hopefully head off any insecurities or assumptions about how his 1st time should/would be.  We literally talked for a little more than 1 hour about girls, sex, condoms, drugs, porn.... As a parent, I want my son to be comfortable in asking me difficult questions. I want him to know he isn't going to be judged for his thoughts, urges and misunderstandings. I'm hoping this will allow me educate him so he can make decisions based off of my experiences and the reality of it all and not just what he hears from teenagers or watches on the internet. Was it difficult to hear all the things he said, YES. I get why parents put up walls and just say ""Sex is bad, avoid at your age"". But dammit in this day and age with porn at every ones fingertips I can't just sit idly by and let him grow up with all these false assumptions! How do you handle this with your kids in the world we live today? Did I do the right thing? EDIT: I'm the father...",Sounds like you did everything right. As parents it's our job to give our kids the tools to make good healthy decisions because we won't always be there to guide them in the right direction. He now has a new tool in that he feels comfortable discussing these things with you.,1111

89rnhh,"This is just a quick post about how consent and actively appreciating (rather than just tolerating or following) other people's boundaries can be sexy! I know a lot of people, myself included, have a strange relationship with boundaries. They're viewed as a negative, maybe not a bad thing, but certainly not a fun thing or a super positive thing, almost like rules and no one loves rules. I've been trying to be more vocal the last year about my sexual boundaries, making sure all sexual encounters are at least an 7 or 8 out of 10, rather than passively doing sexual stuff that I'm not totally into, but don't necessarily mind because I don't want to hurt someone's feelings or make shit awkward.  I recently realized what a disservice that is to myself and the other person(s). I've been really trying to change my relationship with boundaries in general.  Last night I had a great first date with someone, I was feeling it, but for whatever reason I just didn't want to actually have sex with him yet. We're making out (naked) in his hottub and from kiss one he's practicing micro-consent, which is rad. He asked me before kissing me, before touching my boobs, then my pussy, then before actually putting his fingers inside me... things are getting *hot* but I realized I still wasn't totally sure I wanted to have sex with him. So instead of just saying yes because we were already naked and into it, when he asked if I wanted to fuck I said with a smile ""not tonight :)"" and here's the best part.....  He looked at me, smiled this huge genuine smile and said ""cool, thank you"" and proceeded to continue making out with me. What. I was totally prepared for him to just be like ""huh okay"" or even something like ""ugggh I get it, but god I want to fuck you."" His simple, total and complete acceptance and appreciation for my honesty was incredible. We had some more fun, but he wasn't trying to fuck me. Totally respected my boundary while still getting me off with his hands. Then I remembered something one of our mutual friends said about boundaries: ""People should be thankful when someone tells them one of their boundaries, it's an exciting good thing and a sexy thing because it lets you know how to make them feel amazing.""  This guy totally did that. I didn't feel awkward or uncomfortable, I felt respected, sexy and honestly turned on (also it made me want to make him feel good too, so I ended up giving him a BJ which we both enjoyed immensely).  So beautiful people of r/sex, next time someone tells you a sexual boundary, thank them....they're doing both of you a service and boundaries are a good thing :) ","this is gonna sound like a wicked dumb question, but what is micro-consent? edit: why did my idiotic question get so many upvotes lol",1969
8b83qu,"Me - In my early 40s. Why? Because I've come out of a 20 year monogamous marriage, have never done anything like this before, have the cash and I’m not ready to date yet. I also figured it was safer from disease than Tinder. Plus, well… I’m in my 40s, balding and out of shape…  **Where?** Australia, in a city where there are legal, licenced brothels.  **How many?** 5 different Brothels, 10 different sex workers including one private escort (holy shit that actually seems like a lot now that I've written it down).  **Why write this?** Because it might provide useful info. Any Sex workers on here please feel free to comment, good or bad. These are my opinions, observations, and assumptions - I could be wrong.   Terminology – I’m going to use “Sex worker” or “Escort” instead of “Prostitute” because where I’m from it’s a more respectful term.   **BEFORE YOU GO** Many brothels have websites where you can read short bios of the girls. Most of them have fake pictures (the fine print says the image is a ""likeness only"", and the likenesses are usually not all that accurate). The website usually has a roster, so you can see who is working and when. That way once you get to know the girls you know whether the ones you like are working, and can even make a booking in advance for a girl you particularly like.   **ON ARRIVAL** All had off the street parking, behind a 6+ foot fence for privacy. Some of them even had sheets to place over your car for further privacy. None of them had large signs out the front. In general they’re the kind of place you could easily drive past without knowing what it is.   All of them had a front door you can’t open without being buzzed in. They must use the video cameras to judge whether you’re ok to enter.  When you’re buzzed in the manager meets you at the door &amp; asks whether you’ve been there before. If you haven’t then they explain how everything works. They’re usually very friendly and try to put you at ease. They then take you to a small room with 2 chairs, or a small couch. If it’s busy they take you to a normal style waiting room where you have the joy of waiting with other men. This only happened once to me. I never made eye contact with anyone. Once a small room is ready you’re taken in and the door is usually shut.  **THE SMALL ROOM** The small room is the room where you’re introduced to the girls. It usually has 2 chairs or a small couch, a side table with pornos and sexual health pamphlets, a TV with porn playing with the sound down, and a CCTV camera up in the corner looking at you. There are often signs on the wall with stuff like the standard rates and advice safe sex (with condoms) is mandatory by law, so don’t ask for unprotected sex.  **THE RATES** Ok, so I’ve put this before the intros, because it’ll make more sense. There are two rates – one for the brothel and one for the sex worker. The brothel’s rate is purely time based. 20 mins, 30 mins, 45 mins, 1 hour – whatever. It might be about $150 for 30mins. It usually includes the basics of a “massage”, hand job, penis in vagina sex and oral on you, and you get to cum once. That’s all. The sex worker’s rate covers “extras”. What is defined as an extra, and how much the extras are, are entirely up to the individual sex worker. Typical extras include things like kissing the sex worker’s breasts, her kissing your body, you giving oral to the sex worker, kissing each other on the lips, fingering, deep throat blow job vs normal blow job. Basically anything over a hand job and penis in vagina sex.    To make the whole extras thing easier, some girls offer package deals, often called GFE or PSE  GFE = Girlfriend Experience and often includes things like you giving oral on the sex worker, you kissing the sex worker’s breasts, multiple cums.   PSE = Porn Star Experience and includes GFE plus extras like French kissing, deep throat blow job, toys, squirting etc.   **THE INTROS** One by one the girls will come in and introduce themselves. They’re wearing something sexy. They ask you whether you have any questions. Ok, I’ll break from the facts at this point to give an opinion… You may think you’re a big shot having women paraded in one at a time for your choice, but I reckon they’re judging you as much as you’re judging them. “Does this guy have money for extras?” / “Do I really want to fuck this guy with no teeth who smells like he hasn’t showered in a week?”  / “I’ve just done two bookings in a row, I need a break” / “The rent’s due this week and I need the cash” / “I’ve already cleared $600 today, I don’t really need this” etc.  Back to the facts… The girls will ask whether you have any questions. This is the time to ask what’s included in the standard booking fee vs what’s extra. What are extras for some girls will be inclusions for others and vice versa. In general (but not always) the hotter the girl the less is included in standard, and potentially the more extras will cost. I mean if you were the sex worker and you could charge more than the next girl because you’re smoking hot, wouldn’t you?  Some girls will swing in, show little interest and then leave. Others will sit down to have a chat. I guess it comes down to a lot of different factors (see above for a few examples). Once the girls have all come through the manager reappears and asks which girl you’d like. You pay the manager the standard rate.   **THE BEDROOM** The girl you chose comes back &amp; takes you to a bedroom. Depending on the brothel this might be a room with just a shower and bed, or it might be a room with shower, spa bath, massage table, theme room (African etc.). The walk to the bedroom is a good time to engage in a little small talk.   **THE EXTRAS, THE INSPECTION &amp; THE SHOWER** Once you reach the room you confirm what extras you want, and pay the girl in cash on the spot.   Rubber glove time. Time to inspect your junk for infection. If you show signs of infection then it’s a no go. Yes, there are rubber gloves and a light. In fact, if this doesn’t happen then I suggest you GTFO because if they didn’t inspect you then they didn’t inspect the other 100 guys with Herpes, Gonorrhoea etc.   After the inspection they tell you to have a shower to freshen up. Fair enough, but keep an eye on the time. From what I can tell, the clock starts ticking the moment the door shuts. I have a feeling some sex workers use this time to wind down the clock “have a quick shower, I’ll be back in 10 mins” WTF? I booked 30 mins, and 10 mins will be spent in the shower by myself?  The better places will have toothpaste, mouthwash and deodorant available for you to use after your shower.   **THE START** Sometimes the sex worker will offer a massage at the start. I’m guessing this has 2 purposes: Firstly to break the ice between you and her and secondly, to further wind down the clock. Getting started with the sex can be weird. I mean really, both of you are about to have sex with someone you just met. Anyway – the better sex workers will find a way to make this less awkward.   **THE SEX** How is the sex? Well there’s good and there’s bad. *The good:* * You get to have sex with women hotter &amp;/or just plain different than you realistically would ever have been able to outside of this arrangement. Hot young surf chick? Hard rocking chick with tatts? MILF? Slender? Thick? Whatever – you have the opportunity to partake, depending on availability. * You are paying for a service, so there is usually a degree customer service.  * The sex worker is usually experienced and knows how to help.  * You might be able to try a bunch of stuff you’ve never done before.  *The bad:* * It never matches the high of making love to someone with whom you have a true connection. * It never matches the passion of a one night stand, where you’ve both played the game all night and are now down for some hard core fucking.  * You’re having sex with someone who may have already had it several times today / dozens of times this week and despite their efforts, might not seem to be into it.   **AFTERWARDS** After you finish they’ll ask whether you want a shower to clean up. If there’s time left they may give you (a generally shithouse – they’re sex workers, not masseurs after all) massage until time’s up.  There’s usually a timer of some sort – either their phone alarm, or a single phone ring to let you know time’s up.  The girl will often take you out an exit separate from the entrance, for your privacy.   **GENERAL OBSERVATIONS** * Hotter women will often but not always charge more for the same extras and vice versa.  * Some girls will put on music. It’s not just to set the mood – they know how long the playlist goes for and will use it to keep track of the time.  * Some girls will start faking orgasm when it gets close to time, in order to help make you cum. In fact I would say that the best sex workers are the ones who can fake it the best. Personally it’s unfulfilling to have sex with someone who doesn’t give feedback, even if it’s fake.  * Some girls will try to make you cum as fast as possible (they know how to). Remember – many places only allow one shot per session. If you were the sex worker would you prefer having sex for 30 mins or would you make the guy cum in 15 mins then take the next 15 having a shower and giving a massage? Not all girls do this. Like most things that happen in a brothel, a lot is dependent on the sex worker.  * The one time I was put in the waiting room I saw 3 foreign guys (two of whom were mates) and one local. The local must have booked a GFE in advance and brought flowers for the girl. It was really sweet. The girl came to the waiting room in a nice dress to pick him up and took the flowers with a big smile. I thought she did a really good job for the guy.  * Some of the more popular girls get booked out in advance. I’m not at that level of knowing who’s who and when they’re working. But if you like someone then you should probably book them so you don’t miss out.   **ETTIQUETTE AND TIPS** * Remember, the girls are human. Yes, they are providing a service, but that doesn’t mean you can be an arsehole. * Try to build rapport in the small room. Chose a girl you have some chemistry with. Yes, there might have been a hotter girl but would you rather have sex with someone who breezed in for 15 seconds and didn’t give a fuck because she’s so hot she knows she’ll walk out and get booked straight away, or someone who’s only slightly less hot but took the time to sit down and chat with you for 2 minutes?  * You’re paying for a service, but remember point one – the girls are human. I reckon most girls would give better service to a guy who’s average looking but nice, clean, respectful and tries to build rapport vs a guy who’s hot but a complete fuckwit.  * Hygiene! Clean yourself before going. Have a shower, wash your hair, clean your junk (including your arse!), clean your teeth, use mouthwash and put on clean clothes BEFORE heading to the brothel. Yeh, you’ll have to have a shower again before you get there, but do you really think you’ll get the best service if you turn up stinking and flop out your dick for inspection only for it to stink of a hard day’s work, and covered in cheese from not being cleaned properly for days? Or if you’ve cleaned your dick immaculately but forgot to scrub your arse, which is only a couple of inches away. Or do you expect a girl to give a fantastic blow job when you’ve got a thick Amazon forest of pubes around your cock? Besides, if you have a proper shower before going then you don’t have to spend as long getting clean in the room, and get more time on the bed.   * Shave before you go. Run your hand over your face and neck. Feel the stubble? Now imagine that being rubbed on the most sensitive parts of your body several times a day. It would be irritating. If you want the best service then shave. If you have a beard then shampoo it. If it's clean and smells nice then you're more likely to get better service.  * Don’t try to haggle with the girls. Many of the places have signs on the walls asking you not to do this. I reckon it’d be pretty demeaning “So you want $50 extra to suck your tits? Best I can do is $30” Fuck that.  * Keep an eye on the time. Note what time you entered the room. As previously mentioned, some girls will try to wind down the clock by using shower time or massage time. Be aware of this. EDIT: Tidied a couple of things up. One additional point... After re-reading the above it does seem quite clinical and soulless. That's not always the case. Like anything, it all depends on the individual sex worker. Many have the interpersonal skills and put in the effort to make the whole experience fantastic. For me personally however, there will always be a little bit missing because there's no intimate connection between the two of us. EDIT 2: This post has been turned into an article [here](https://www.smutbuttons.com/guide-to-visiting-a-melbourne-brothel/).

8bwizj,"I did not know this was a thing until it happened to me the other night, but I was hooking up with a guy I had just met and he took the condom off during sex without telling me. The sex was definitely consensual, but taking off the condom was not. I didn't notice until we changed positions and I happened to touch his dick with my hand. It was very surprising, upsetting, and violating, and apparently it's not only fairly common, but has a name and is a more recent trend.  I probably should have been a little wary, this guy was older than me and claimed to not have had any sex whatsoever for a really long time (7 years) despite being pretty attractive. We had been drinking and he seemed to feel bad about it when I got upset with him, and when I asked him why he openly admitted that it was because it feels better without it and he didnt think he'd be able to come with a condom on. Regardless, obviously that doesn't make it okay and nothing like that had ever happened to me before. I will be getting STD tested despite the fact that he claims to not have been sexually active in so long and is ""clean"". I'm angry and upset that I even have to do that when I made an effort to be responsible and safe.  Just making a PSA for you all out there, be careful of this.  Edit: Wow, thank you all for the support and advice, I'm overwhelmed. I had no idea this situation was so common, but hope that posting this has helped spread some awareness both so people know to watch out for assholes that do this and so that others realize how violating and wrong it is to do this to someone. I am getting tested and exploring my legal options today, can't thank you all enough. ","This is considered rape here in Australia, there's been tons of discussions about it on one of our national radio stations aimed at young adults because it's so common. Pretty sure someone was prosecuted for it recently. And yeah, if someone has done it once, they'll do it again, even if they show remorse, it's just because they got caught.",3346
8galp8,"My boyfriend's groin area has a very distinct smell to it that I LOVE. He's extremely hygenic & his skin always smells incredibly fresh and almost sweet (I think that latter part is just because I'm so attracted to his scent).

If I'm not going anywhere the rest of the day, I try to avoid showering just so I can catch catch a whiff of it throughout the day. It's so comforting and so overwhelmingly *him*.  I thought about texting him to tell him how much I love when I can smell his cock on me after he fucks me, but I don't know if that's strange or not. Am I the only person who loves this?

8gp2hh,"I wish I was born somewhere else rather than that stupid Islamic country called Egypt. I mean almost everybody in my country is a stupid close minded.  We can rarely talk to girls. We can rarely even see them because of that stupid hijab that almost every women wears. They even separate us in schools. That's from the common reasons why many arabs turn gay. Also the top countries that browse porn are mostly arab and muslim countries. Also whenever we see any male just talking to a girl in school they call her a whore. Not just having sex is forbidden but even being in a relationship is forbidden. That's why sexual repression is serious issue in my country.

8ieg3i,"A year ago I bought a small rechargeable vibrator. Was great until lately I've had to shake it to get the motor to turn on. Well tonight, or rather this morning, it broke.

I'm just hoping the battery dies before my roommates get up. I'm laughing but also mortified Edit: 8 hour update. It's still lighting up and trying!

8mhu59,"If you asked me  a year ago if that was a thing I was willing to do, I would have scoffed in disgust. I was raised in a super religious, conservative household that shamed any sexual thought and pretty much any position outside of missionary. Cumming anywhere but inside a woman for the purpose of procreation was a sin. Once, when I was about 10 or 11, my dad and one of my brothers made some very disparaging comments about anal sex in regards to homosexuality and that's sort of stuck with me. I don't think they realized I was paying attention, but I was and it stuck. I broke out of religion a long time ago - partially because I moved away from home and made several friends who happened to be gay. All of a sudden, my perspective shifted drastically. I haven't bought into my family's line of thinking for a long time, but those unpleasant thoughts linger in ways I don't understand. Anyway. I have rewritten this post several times. I seem to consistently end up in tangents no one needs to know entirely because I just want to gush. But the reality is that my SO made it clear what he wanted. He's not a words guy, which has taken some adjusting for me. Previously, I suspected what he wanted, but I was worried I was misreading his cues. Tonight he very obviously positioned himself to make it easier for me, so I licked him gently to see what would happen. He responded super positively, bucking right into my face, and then I just fucking went for it. I licked, kissed, sucked that asshole while I reached under and started to stroke his cock. He was moaning loud, which only made me want to do it more. Eventually, I started just lapping at his asshole with determination and he lost it. I licked and sucked at him like it was my final meal. He was moaning in a way I'd never heard before. All I could do was bury my face in his ass and keep on keepin' on. The only thing I wanted in that moment was to make him keep cumming, which he did, longer and harder than he has in the year we've been together. I guess my point is that you think you know what you want, what is sexy, etc., until the person you are so deeply, desperately into, wants something different. And then you have to decide...can you give that to them or is it too much? I'm so fucking glad I decided I could give it to him. He will be back and he will surely reciprocate in ways I can't imagine, because that's just his way. All I know is I'm bursting with pride at being able to give him what he wanted and letting him just explode the way he did. I don't believe he's ever had that before. I'm the first woman he's dated since his marriage and when we had sex for the first time, he told me it had been 3 1/2 years (!!!) for him. What a damn waste.","My hubby is phobic about his bumhole, I have to stay away. I have a sneaking suspicion he would love it though. I have questions.  1) did it taste weird?  2) was it awkward at all?  3)does he have a hairy booty?  ",1112
8o2woj,"A bit of context- I always had an amazing relationship and we’re very passionate and compatible. Her sex drive has always been quite high, but over the months it decreased slightly. Our relationship never had troubles, but I just took some advice here and there from reddit. I learnt a ‘secret’ (probably not so secret) about women’s libido that really strengthen my relationship. Whenever I was horny , I used to send dick pictures or other ‘visuals’, I used to tell her I wanted to fuck her hard. If we were together I’d touch her, or kiss her breasts. All of this worked very well in the beginning, because we were still exploring each other. However over the long term, it didn’t have the same effect on her. She was very opened about it and told me that it’s not the way she would be turned on, though she did enjoy the pictures and kisses.  Now I realized that women (sorry if this is a generality and I’m certain it does not apply to all women) are more turned on by ROMANCE. I truly love her and so here are all the advice and little things I picked up that really worked for me over the last few months. What’s amazing is that it’s like passion never wore off between us. The sex has never been that incredible and she is the one constantly initiating now. I had a lot of relationship fail because I did not realize this / or realize this way too late- and sex is the first factor that goes wrong in a failing relationship.  So thank you reddit, for all these advices I picked up from the thousands of posts I read. 1)     Words (making her understand  that she is unique , that she is the one and only) : this can be by texts , verbally , or letters. What worked the best for us is when these words were very sincere - actual qualities she has or actual experiences I had With her that made me feel amazing with her. This needs to be done regularly and not just before sex.  2)     Give her some space regularly and send thoughts constantly 3)     When you are apart : instead of starting with a visual picture : start with how much you want to be with her and actually make love to her, be close to her. Then be as naughty as you want together.  4)     Make- out sessions- instead of directly touching her- I kissed her intensely and with love and let her come to me. It’s important to take the time for that.  5)     Emotional connections- these moments and build-ups made her (and myself) crazy aroused. Not easy to have after a few months/ years so here is the best advice I picked: choose a time / place (restaurant, at home, bar...) with no tv, no distractions. Drink a bit together to be tipsy and closer. And listen to each other. Ask questions that build connection/ deep questions. Here are some: - What’s a time where you were happy ? - What is your real and deepest insecurity ? - How have you changed over the year? - What do you think of marriage? - What do you think is the secret of a good relationship? - Tell me about a couple you know that you admire? - What do you think is the biggest mistake in a relationship? - What advice would you give to a friend for his proposal? - Tell me the details of your hardest experience ? - Tell me the details of X experience? - What do you think of this trait of character? ",This exactly . THANK YOU for this post . You are expressing exactly what I can’t explain to my boyfriend. I have a high sex drive too and we have a good relationship- but it’s difficult to explain him that my libido works differently than his. ,1677
8rz5e3,"If you need something from them, or want more sex, you want to try something new, just tell them. For the last couple years my wife and i only had sex maybe once a week if that. It was really effecting me negatively, especially the last few weeks. Last Thursday we were talking about work and money and all the things you have to discuss in a marriage. At the end of the talk she asked me what's been wrong with me lately and i just kind of blew it off and said things like ""it's nothing"" and ""I'm just tired from work"".  She pressed a little more and i kind of blurted out ""We could have sex a little more often!""  She said ""really?""  ""Yeah. Just a little more than once every other Sunday morning."" She said ""ok.""  Long story short we've had sex 6 times since last Thursday. Apparently she just assumed i was too tired from work since i put in about 70 hours per week and wanted to let me sleep. She thought she was doing me a favor and i wasn't willing to communicate and it was causing a lot of tension in our marriage. Bottom line is just be honest about what you need with the most important person in your life.

8uemx8,"Hello. I’m currently at home and recovering from a suicide attempt from last year. I shot myself in the chest. I’m posting here because I was a regular here before my attempt. I never posted or commented or even had an account but I read every single day. I had so many insecurities. The thing is, whenever I read a thread about them, people here would say that it was a mental issue and they needed medical help. I could never accept this. And it nearly killed me. So let me explain a little about who I am so that maybe someone reading can make better choices than I have.  I’m currently 31 years old, black male. I started getting on Reddit back around my 24th birthday. I had a ton of insecurities but the main ones, at that time, were my weight, penis size, race, my looks, and my inexperience.  I fixated on these things in a kind of rotation. As soon as I stopped obsessing about my weight, I was fixated on my penis size.  Eventually I started taking steps to make the best of what I had so I did the healthier diet, I worked out, started skincare, forces myself into social interactions to refine social skills, bought better clothes...the list goes on but suffice it to say I worked hard for about 2.5 years to drastically improve my looks and my social skills. Then my fixation transferred to some loose skin from weight loss and my lack of sexual experience. Eventually, though, I was able to ignore my skin and I found a great woman who was accepting of me and my lack of experience.  I was no longer a virgin, but now I was insecure about only having one partner. I cheated on her and there are no excuses for that. She was never anything but loving and compassionate towards me but I cheated on her multiple times and broke her heart because I didn’t see her as a person who loved me, I saw her as a checked box on a list.  After she broke up with me, I focused on my penis size. That **must** have been the real reason. Not the cheating, the lies, the indifference to her pain. It was my penis size, which she never mentioned. Then it was because I was black because the next guy I saw her with was white. So I just started seeking casual sex constantly. Not just with tinder but I sought out sex workers, I lied to female friends who I could tell had developed some romantic feelings for me. I treated people like garbage in pursuit of this feeling of validation.  And the feeling never came.  Every single one of my insecurities ended up being improved on or I eventually learned I didn’t have a reason to be insecure about them. I couldn’t please everybody and their preferences and it’s crazy but when I finally accepted that, that’s the night I tried killing myself. And beyond relationships and sex, I also had my dream job, and a great apartment, my dream car, my dog. By any standard of measurement I had everything I ever wanted and still felt completely hopeless and empty. I hated myself. Now after a long and ongoing recovery I’m laying in my bed and the same woman who first loved me and who I cheated on is taking care of me. And I’m fully aware I don’t deserve her care. I’ve had many hours to lay and think about what lead me to suicide and the only possible explanation is mental illness.  My point in posting this is to say: yes, go and improve yourself. Get in shape, get better dressed, get a career, get social skills, do all of that. But if any of that makes you want to die, get mental help. You literally need a doctor to help you save yourself from your own thoughts.  Even now, my fixation is shifting to how ashamed I am of my suicide attempt. But I’m going to fight against my mind now. ","my dude. its so goddamn brave to admit all these things, not only that but the fact you are able to come to terms with them shows how much you've grown as a person.  best of luck with your future, my man, I hope you are getting the help you need",1057
8v9j5t,"Okay, so this is something that happened to me quite a few years ago. And when this occurred, it felt as though I’d just unlocked a door to my favorite new pleasure center. I hope more couples will try this technique out, if you haven’t already. I used to have some difficulty climaxing via PIV sex, I wouldn’t say it was impossible for me to climax via PIV sex, but it was certainly a rare case. I had broken up with my ex (of 1 year) and had started seeing this new man. He was by far the best lover I had experienced, not just physically, but emotionally. He would talk to me in a way that would make me drop all my silly insecurities that I had given life to in my head. I would just feel very “secure” when I was with him, it was honestly a bit of an emotional break through. Our first couple of times having sex were pretty normal though, I didn’t orgasm, but it was satisfying. Then one time when he was on top of me, he angled his dick upwards (while it was inside my vagina) so it was hitting my G-Spot. Which felt great, but nothing of which I hadn’t experienced before... Until he decided to simultaneously place his fingers just above my pubic bone (the soft area just above the pubic bone, but below the belly) as he fucked me. Here, he would press down with his fingers rather firmly until he could feel the tip of his penis that was thrusting my g-spot from inside my vagina. OH. MY. GOD. And then he would use the flat part of his fingers to massage little circles around this pubic area, generating enough force that he would feel his cock head inside me. I had never felt anything like it, it’s hard to explain the feeling, but basically he was sandwiching my G-Spot with his dickhead and fingers. This was the first night that I ever experienced multiple orgasms via penetration. However, I haven’t come across anyone else that’s tried this technique. It seems like I need to teach every future partner of mine this technique (not that I mind doing that), but has anyone else had experience with this technique before? If not, you're missing out if you don't try it.TL;DR - Had trouble climaxing via penetration, an old lover tried a technique of sandwiching my G-Spot with his fingers and dickhead. It worked, I now orgasm multiple times from it. P.S. Literally just created this reddit account.",Sort of discovered it accidentally. I was laying on my back she was reverse cowgirl and at one point laid all the way back down on my chest. I reached around and played with her clit but in doing so the base of my palm was pressing down on that area. She came so hard her legs were shaking for quite a while. ,1484

I feel her hand on my back and it softly runs down my lower back and onto my ass, light squeeze and she goes to sleep.  This sort of thing rarely happens. So ladies, show your guy that he is a turn on from time to time. Feel him up. Grab his ass in public. Tell him he looks good in his underwear. Guys want to be lusted after too. Guys aren't socialized to accept compliments or give them to each other, so chances are we will brush you off but do it anyway.

8w95zc,"My bf (27/m) and I (26/f) were talking about fantasies.  We had been together for six months. I have had a pegging kink for the longest time but I have never been brave enough to bring it up to a guy because I was scared of the exact thing that happened!  For some reason, I was feeling quite confident/sexual that day, so I was honest and told him about my pegging kink. He gave me a look like 'wow. umm. okay.' He obviously wasn't expecting that.  He looked turned off, so I immediately said 'it's just a fantasy. obviously I would never expect you to do anything that you aren't comfortable with"". I apologized as well. The next day he said 'I don't think we are sexually compatible... I think we should see other people'. I was devastated, because I really liked him. I also felt kinda humiliated. I feel unfeminine/disgusting... because this is what I like.  My friends keep asking me why we broke up, and I can't even tell them the real reason.  I was just starting to open up sexually, and explore my kinky side, and then this happened. It has really affected my self-esteem too, I told him this deepest darkest fantasy that I had, made myself vulnerable and he rejected me for it. I could never tell another guy. Edit - I just wanted to say thank you for all the support!  I read each and every reply and I'm really feeling so much more normal about this now.  You guys are amazing! Thank you, thank you, thank you.","My partner and I discovered we are pretty far from sharing the same kinks. She's almost completely vanilla, and I'm... well... kinda depraved. It was a little hard for her (even though she already knew I was kinky). Instead of us breaking up, we discussed matters, and came to the conclusion that we are both happy sexually, and in every other way, so it doesn't matter much. I guess my point is this: you attempted to communicate honestly, and he didn't. He bailed before you could talk about it. This says far more about him, than you. It would appear that you're the more mature one out of the two of you. Don't change because of him. Plus, there's plenty of guys who would be into that, or would at least consider it.",5548
8wslga,"My wife and I usually wipe drips with a towel or tissue and then she'll usually head to the bathroom to clean up some more. If there's a wet spot it's not a big deal, but she doesn't like to sleep in it. But, I've got to share a funny story involving her and her sister. My wife's younger sister is a couple years younger than her and has always been a bit on the wild side, into art and tattoos, and until recently dated a lot of dudes none of whom seemed terribly great. About a year ago she met this new guy who's an art teacher, plays music, and is really pretty cool. The first time we saw her with him (at Thanksgiving or something) it was obvious this was different: just the way she held his hands and clung to him and looked in his eyes. They eloped after about 6 months and not long after that came to stay with us for a long weekend. When they left they had to catch an early plane and I told them I'd take care of washing their sheets (I usually do the laundry around here). The sheets in our guest room are dark in color and as I went to gather them later that morning I immediately noticed several wet splotches and a larger number of dried whitish stains. No question what that was. I didn't think it was gross or hot or anything, just glad my sister and law felt they could enjoy themselves in our home, and threw them in the wash on cold with pleny of soap. Fast forward a few months and they came to stay with us again, but my wife washed the sheets and I guess she's a bit nosy. Her sister was still around and they had the following conversation, which my wife told me about later: My wife: ""A lot of splooge on those sheets. Glad you're having a good time."" sister: ""Yeah."" wife (teasing): ""Did you ever hear of a towel though? Aren't you supposed to like get up and pee so you don't get a UTI?"" sister: ""Yeah but I didn't think anyone actually did that. No condoms so its like, all organic and stuff."" wife: ""So you just spend the night in a puddle of cum?"" sister: ""Isn't that the whole point of getting married?"" Anyway, perhaps not surprisingly, sister is now pregnant and everyone is excited. ",Mazel tov! And we pee to avoid UTIs. ,1817

I don't like to think of her or her sexuality since she is my little girl but im also a clueless single dad and ask questions on here all the time.  Since I know she is doing that now would it be out of line to get her one or should I just let her be? ","I was a single mom to boys for awhile. I had a notebook. so if there was ever questions they could write them and ask without having to make eye contact. because eye contact can be embarrassing for developing peoples. we have conversations now but it's weird for them to ask their mom sometimes.  it doesn't always have to be this way but even as a mom to adult kids I will sometimes feel more comfortable speaking with a woman because she has the same body parts and experience. it's so important to be honest and open I think for her entire life of health. the kind of dad a girl has really shapes her life. telling her everyone does it, is so right. women are sometimes made to feel shame for having even those thoughts and it can be a mental burden.  I wouldn't rely on schools to properly educate about that but there are many resources online and I don't think it's a bad idea to offer any and all support you can for her. and safety is a huge issue. good luck.

8yaemw,"I [M28] used to be really skiddish of period sex. Never did it until recently, with my current girlfriend [F27]. We were in bed and I couldn't take my hands off of her. She seemed a little nervous, but as I was continuing to initiate she stopped me and asked, ""Babe, you know I'm on my period right?"" I did, of course, but I didn't care. I asked her if she wanted to stop but she said she wanted it as long as I was cool with it. I was. I love her, the thought of it wasn't weird, and I wanted her. So we had sex. It wasn't any different than normal, other than the fact that we just stayed in missionary the whole time to minimize a possible mess. She came ridiculously hard, because of all of the intergalactic goings-on down there, and the first thing she said was ""Holy shit you killed my cramps!"" We laughed and cuddled, and then the realization kicked in that we needed some cleanup. So we hopped in the shower, and laughed and made jokes that it looked like a massacre. But as we cleaned up and rinsed off we just kept touching and hugging. And just kissed for a long time in the shower. Period sex had never been something I was really into or willing to do with partners in the past, and she said the same thing. She'd done it once with her ex and he made sure to let her know he wasn't interested in ever doing that again, which gave her a lot of insecurities and nervousness that he thought her period was gross. A period's a period to me, not gross at all. Who cares? It's a part of her and I love her. And when I said those exact words to her we just connected in a really deep way. For the rest of the night until we went to bed we just couldn't keep our hands off each other or stop kissing each other somewhere randomly. It was such an emotional thing to breach that with her, and gaining an entirely newfound level of trust and love/acceptance with one another. She has a terrible time emotionally during PMS, and she dreads that week and her period every month. Being able to make that time for her a little bit better is awesome. It definitely brought us a lot closer.  I'm such a fan of period sex now.

8z1bp3,"So I was reading a post here by a guy, and in that post the OP briefly talks about how refusing another guy almost resulted in a fight. This made me realise something. It is so risky for a girl to go home with a random guy. I am a 21 YO straight male. I have a naturally strong build and have been training for various sports for the last five years. I have never even considered the possibility of a fight with a girl I've been with, but when I think about it now, I could easily overpower any of my sexual partners so far. If they had decided to not respect my limits or hurt me in anyway (sexual or physically) I could easily defend myself.  This is not the case for the vast majority of women. [This Study](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4vcxd0/almost_all_men_are_stronger_than_almost_all_women/) claims that almost all men are stronger than almost all women. Of course there are outliers but for your average girl, going home with a random guy might easily mean having a horrible traumatising experience if the guy doesn't care about her consent. I always thought the main reason men in general were more promiscuous than women were societal norms. But now that I think about it, it is genuinely more dangerous for a girl to hookup with a guy than vice-versa.  Just wanted to share this as I figure there might be other guys who haven't realised this yet. Edit: A lot of the comments are from women saying many men don't realise this to which I definitely agree. However I also keep on getting occasional ""LOL DUH YOU SO DUM OP HAHA"" comments. So if you want to comment that, consider  two things. * Turns out some stuff are not as obvious as you think they are. * You commenting ""DUH!"" as the previous 10+ people doesn't serve any purpose.","Just a reminder of the community rules: > - Absolutely no hate-speak, derogatory or disrespectful comments will be tolerated.",3120
8znql5,"I just read a recent thread about a man who was interested in having an MFF threesome with his girlfriend, but was hesitant about having a MMF in return, and he was feeling guilty about that, and some people even chimed in that it’s not “fair” if him and his partner had an MFF but not a MMF.   I’ve also seen threads where a man is guilted for wanting to try anal with his gf, but not being comfortable with having her peg him. Again, some people will guilt the OP by saying it’s not “fair” that he has anal sex with her but won’t agree to getting pegged.  Now let me say clearly - no one, man or woman, should *ever* be forced into an uncomfortable situation. We all have boundaries and those boundaries should be respected.   But if someone agrees to a sex act because *they* feel comfortable with it, their partner should not be guilted into a role reversal of the same sex act because it’s “fair.”   So in my first example with the threesome - if OP’s girlfriend is comfortable with having a MFF, and is willing to have one...OP shouldn’t then be guilted into having a MMF. It’s not his fault his girlfriend was interested in adding an extra woman to the bedroom. If he’s uncomfortable adding a *man* into the mix, he shouldn’t be expected to even the score, so to speak. Because in that equation, his girlfriend got to have two sexual experiences she was comfortable with, whereas he had one experience he was comfortable with and one he was *uncomfortable* with.   Same with the anal example. If a woman is open to trying anal, then those two partners can explore anal. That doesn’t mean the guy then has to agree to get his ass pegged if he knows without a doubt that’s not something he’d be interested in.  It bothers me that there’s adults that believe this. That sex is some quid pro quo transaction where anything you’re willing to do means you then have to be willing to have done to you or else you’re being unfair/hypocritical.   And again I want to make the distinction that - I’m talking specifically about partners being comfortable with certain sex acts. Obviously if a person is *pushing* their significant other to do something they’re uncomfortable with, then it’s hypocritical to not offer the same open mindedness in return.  But if I’m meeting a girl who’s openly down to try a MFF? I’m not going to give her a MMF in return because I have no interest in that.  I mean, am I wrong here? Do people out there actually believe that sex needs to be “even?”  Edit: Wow thank you stranger for the gold! ❤️ ","There are good ways and there are bad ways to use the concept of fairness and reciprocity.  As /u/G_o_o_d_n_a_s_t_y pointed out, there are times when people use the concept of fairness to get through to an OP who is pressuring their partner for something that their partner doesn't want.  In the specific example of anal, saying, ""why don't you try putting something in your own butt?"" is actually a really good argument against guys who don't know (or don't care) that anal can be really painful for the receiver if done wrong.   However, there are also many times when the concepts of fairness and reciprocity are overused.  As you rightly pointed out, sex is not a transaction or a trade.  Good sex happens when both partners are playing a role that they enjoy.  For example, a dom and a sub shouldn't feel that they have to switch roles just for fairness' sake if neither of them actually want that, nor should they feel guilty for sticking to the roles that they actually enjoy.  The whole point of consent is that people are allowed to have their own preferences and boundaries, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to fulfill a certain role but not the inverse of that role.  Finding a partner whose sexual preferences are the inverse of yours is what *compatibility* is all about. So I suppose it depends on the context and the way people are making the fairness/reciprocity argument.  If they're using it to get through to a pushy person who doesn't understand or respect their partner's boundaries, that is a valid use of the argument.  If they're using it to push a mathematically-equal, rigid-reciprocity view of sex, then that is an invalid use of the argument.",1535
90xjhm,"One thing I read about online constantly is how straight men often get frustrated, jealous, judgemental etc, of women because of how ""easy"" casual sex and getting sexual interest is for us. And its true, on the front end of sexual interest, getting phone numbers, compliments, requests etc, women do have an easier time. Men are expected to be pursuers, and there is always a critical mass of men interested in casual sex pretty much anywhere. However, men seem to not realize that the harder part for women is the next stage, actually getting GOOD sex.  First, women have to determine, amongst people who are interested, who seems scary, unsafe, too forceful in their perspective etc. (basically someone who sounds like they would ignore your requests to stop something or not do something) . Because remember, if you are a woman having sex, you have to be concerned about safety and not getting raped/murdered in a different way then men do, if at all. After that work to weed out scaries, we then often have to determine sexual compatibility to see if we will have a good time. I hear this phrase repeated, that bad sex is like bad pizza, even when it's bad it's still pretty good. This really isnt true for women most of the time. Bad sex for us is sometimes painful, doesn't result in any orgasm or sometimes any sexual satisfaction, and can even feel like someone is masturbating with your body rather then really experiencing something with you. It fucking sucks, and once you have had bad sex and amazing sex, you dont want to go back.  Often times, even with all of that work, making sure you have a safe, compatible partner, you will still miss the mark and have unsatisfactory sex. The last guy I slept with came immediately without warning after a 30 sec blow job, and then was completely disinterested in doing anything to help me orgasm, and was not able to get hard again for more sex later. He eventually used my vibrator on me, but hit my cervix with it because he was just ramming it into me and wasnt being attentive (edit* this was despite my coaching and asking him to do it a certain way several times). I just told him to stop, and used it when he left. I will not be calling him again, but in his mind, it was probably never about me, it was about getting his dick wet, and he could care less about my experience. He knew what to say and how to behave up until that point to fool me. however, and it's frustrating. I would say 75% of the time, I have great sex, so I have gotten good at compatibility, but it took years to know what I was looking for.  Overall, I am quite happy with my sex life, and I get bad sex just happens sometimes.  So, overall, it seems to me yhis type of stuff happens less to straight men. I think women are taught to be attentive to men's needs in sex, and often times, a sex act is not considered ""done"" until the man ejaculates/orgasms, so this and lots of factors result in more positive sexual experiences for men, as their needs are often centered (this is not to discount the many men who are very attentive or love seeing their partners get off, we love you guys. I'm talking more broad, cultural understandings about sex). So for women, yes, we have an easier time generating prospects, but a harder time leaving with a good experience.  This isnt to say one is better or worse, but it is to say we need to understand what dating and sex looks like from other perspectives, and not be quick to claim one gender has it the easiest. Safety and compatibility concerns are really burdensome and I would like more men to understand that about women.  Edit: Nothing in this post is meant to imply I think men are solely responsible for my pleasure, men cannot have bad sex via starfish women etc. Its about a narrative I hear men saying about women and sex, and me offering a perspective. I love  being an attentive sexual partner, and get joy out of mutually great sex like most people, which I work at and put effort towards. It sucks when one's partner doesn't, as I am sure many men would agree with as well.  Edit #2: Thank you so much for my first gold! I appreciate it! Also, one more piece of information to add about the safety comment. I did not go into alot of detail because the threshold is different for every woman. For myself, I usually like to have a public meeting, like coffee or something, with someone beforehand to get a feel for their affect, and that is after some text chatting to determine baseline agreements on things like condom use and sexual compatibility (as best you can). If a small issue, like changing a meeting date if that's needed, or saying you are not into a particular sex act, causes a huge blow up, then its an immediate severing of communication. i have been harassed before, I have had pictures stolen and used to post a fake personal ad on craigslist using my contact info without my consent in retaliation for not meeting, and other such scary encounters. Doing all of that for a hookup, can be exhausting, as you can imagine, and like my original post says, sometimes you do all of this and still wind up with a bad fit. Its no one's fault, and I am not blaming the guy persay or myself. It happens though, and we should talk about it. Edit #3: Probably my last edit, but no promises. I just wanted to offer a conclusion per say. First, thank you all so much for the great discussion. I did not plan on spending my Sunday chatting on Reddit but it has been fun and eye opening. Second, it is so interesting how people have taken this post. Most people I think understood my intent, which was really just to offer my perspective on a common sexual cliche or concept I often hear straight men speaking about in relation to women. I was coming from a place of openness and learning, and I hope that came across. Other people have taken this post to mean I was blaming men for not being good in bed, bragging about my sexual prospects, complaining I don't have good enough sex (missing the 75% line), complaining that my sex is too good (noticing the 75% line), being too broad, being too specific, that men don't have a right to good sex too, that men don't suffer from violence too, etc etc. All of that I expected (and is not what I was trying to say btw), but what saddens me the most are the comments that seem to insist there is nothing at all to learn about women and our perspective, that all of this is some evil game we play and that both genders are trying to paradoxically both fuck and destroy one another. I am not going to ask how we got here, but I am going to say I hope a day comes when we think of each other as fully realized people, partners, friends, and colleagues, and not as enemies. We are one of the first generations, in the U.S. at least but in many places, trying to figure out what life can look like without strict gender roles, where people get to be individuals if possible, and its hard. But we cannot get anywhere if we don't have conversations like these, which may imperfect and messy, and at least entertain the notion we are more similar than different and each have struggles to understand. If you are compelled to write this off as snowflake, hippy garbage, I have just saved you the trouble :).","This is something a good female friend described to me once, and it was really eye-opening. Shortly afterwards, I ended up having to post an ad online as a woman looking for casual sex. The one thing that really stood out to me was that all the men pretty much had the exact same thing to say. You could even file them into categories. I'm not sure how, but most of the time I could tell the guy was full of BS despite him promising to be the best lover ever. I learned that women really have to start looking beyond that BS. Subtle little hints that might show the guy is not just all talk. Can he use complete sentences and good grammar? Is he actually paying attention to what she's saying? How does he handle a little adversity? None of these things are foolproof, but they helped in weeding out the duds.  Sometimes, it's less what you say, and more how you say it. ",1562
915ueh,"I made a long post to this sub early yesterday about my (23F) boyfriend (22M) and his struggles with performance anxiety and his inability to stay hard. (https://redd.it/90y3qh) One piece of advice I got, more than once, was quite subtle and gave me an important insight into his mindset which I hadn’t considered before.  More than one person asked me, (promoted by something I mentioned in the post), what kind of stuff I say to him when we are trying to have sex.  Previously I’d been saying stuff which I thought would help, like ‘I want you so much’ or ‘I want you hard inside me’, ‘I want you to fuck me’, ‘I want your cock’... (yeah I know I don’t have much dirty talk imagination!!). I thought letting him know how much I wanted him would be sexy, and helpful... Two people (one man, one woman) suggested that I might actually be putting more pressure on him. Dirty talk is good, but I should be focusing on other stuff rather than how much I wanted him inside me. Sounds kinda obvious when I write it now, but I think my own desire for sex was kinda influencing what I said.  So this morning, when he woke up beside me and we started making out, I made a really subtle change. Instead of telling what I wanted, I let him know how good everything felt, how much I was enjoying the touching and making out in it’s own right. ‘That feels so good’, ‘I love your fingers on my clit’, ‘you make me so wet’, ‘kiss my tits’... that sort of thing. (Sounds corny I know. It sounded hotter in the moment!) I also didn’t spend much time stroking his cock. I would touch it, in passing, but I didn’t focus on it at all. I let him kiss and touch me, and held his body, telling him how good he felt.  And it worked!! It just felt so smooth and natural as he moved on top of me, and suddenly he was fucking me, rock hard, no problem.  I didn’t say anything stupid like ‘cum for me’. I was close after the fingering, so I told him that, just ‘I’m close’ then ‘I’m gonna cum’, and as I had an orgasm he came inside me. Fucking simultaneous orgasm, from our first ever full sex!!! :) :) So yeah it didn’t last that long, probably like 90 seconds of actual sex. But oh my god the relief of having done it, of finally having him fully hard inside me with no fear of losing it. And finishing inside me too. You should have seen the smile on his face!!! So, I wanted to share that advice, because although it seemed quite subtle and if I’m honest, I wasn’t sure it would work - boy did it work well. Just that slight change in the phrases I used, and their focus on my pleasure instead of my expectations.  It might not work for anyone else, or in evey case. But if your boyfriend has performance anxiety like mine did, maybe it will help you too!  Thanks so much to everyone who replied and for all your advice. And especially those who gave me those tips!  Isla **Edit - Update** - it’s 3am here, the morning after I posted this, and he just woke me for sex. Long, loving, sleepy, sexy, passionate, fantastic sex. Not much talking but, he stayed hard through two position changes, from spooning to missionary to cowgirl. I came first then finished him with a blowjob and he stayed hard for that too. Safe to say, I think he’s feeling a bit more confident now!! Totally amazing what taking the pressure off can achieve. ","This is awesome advice. When we went through a spell of ED, I found I needed my wife to walk a fine line between interest in sex, yet not paying attention to my penis. What didn't work well is what you described, followed by her noting that my penis was hard with ""See, he works just fine. It's all in your head"". Her intention was to help my confidence... But it would kill the mood lol.",1425
91np58,"I've met a lot of men recently who have expressed deep-seated insecurities about themselves and about how they perform in bed. They think that their dicks are too small. They think they don't last long enough in bed. They think that they can't fulfill their woman's fantasies of masculinity and virility. They think that they aren't enough, and I've been thinking about it a lot lately. As a woman, I've had my fare share of insecurities. I know what it's like to feel inadequate, unattractive, unsatisfactory. We women spend too much time poking and prodding at our bodies and trying to compensate for whatever shortcomings we may see in ourselves, and for that very reason, I think we sometimes forget to give much needed attention to the men out there struggling with the very same problem. I see so many posts here where women are mourning some significant flaw they perceive in themselves and men are quick to remind them that they don't want perfection, they want us to feel confident and to stop second-guessing ourselves. Unhappy because you have small breasts? Own them because your man just loves that they are attached to you. Gained weight recently? Your man is embracing your new curves and doesn't understand why you're upset. Think your labia are unattractive? He's too busy burying his face in them to notice. I've learned a lot from men on this subreddit about how to accept my body and my sexuality and to stop critiquing my appearance and my every move in the bedroom. But men rarely get the chance to express insecurity and so they don't always get the reassurance I think they deserve. Every man I've had a relationship with was extraordinary to me in his own way--despite any insecurities they may have had, they were sex gods to me and I didn't express that in the ways that I should have. But now I want to pay it forward. Ladies, it's time we take a chapter out of our men's books and remind them that we too have no interest in perfection. We want you exactly the way you are.  To all of you men out there who think that you aren't allowed to display insecurity because it might conflict with absurd societal expectations of what masculinity should look like, this post is to remind you that there's nothing wrong with you!! Insecurity isn't feminine--it's human. I promise that the lady in your life sees well beyond the little things you don't like about yourself and simply sees a man that makes her heart jump and her panties wet.  Women of /r/sex, don't forget to tell your boyfriends, husbands, fuckbuddies what you like about them. Tell him how often you fantasize about him. Tell him you love his smile, the way he touches you, his smell. Make him feel wanted, and remind him that he's enough. Build up his confidence! Men are beautiful, strong, enchanting, sexy creatures and you deserve to feel that way. Don't forget that! Edit: Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for the kind response this post has received. Scrolling through the comments, I'm tearing up just seeing that this post has had a positive effect on so many of you and that I've been able to start an open dialogue about something like this. This is why I love this subreddit <3 And thank you so much for the gold!! I'm honored.","I appreciate the fuck out of this post. Long story short my ex made it very hard for me to trust anyone. I’m honestly past the point of insecurity, into something much worse. I’ve been in a state where compliments towards me aren’t working. My mind quickly defaults to, “oh she’s just saying that because *insert reason*. I assume compliments are lies made up to lift my spirits. Meaning then that persistence and reassurance are necessary to truly get me to believe anything. Even through active self reassurance I haven’t been able to kick the habit.  Everyone needs compliments and reassurance. Men aren’t all stoic, confident, and comfortable. We too posses hearts, some just as vulnerable as many women. Thank you OP, at least for me this post meant a lot. ",650
91yuo7,"I noticed there are a lot of posts about how to give a good blow job and I thought I’d help boost some men’s confidence and teach them some tips on how to give a girl some delicious head.  The hottest thing you can do is go down on a girl with no expectations in return. First start by mouth to mouth kissing slowly working your way down her body: kiss her neck, chest, tummy, and in between her thighs. Tease her, make her beg - we love the build up. Focus on kissing her inner thighs and right below her belly button - those are her erogenous zones.  After you’ve built her up - eat the cake. Focus on licking her clit in circular motions. Some women like a pulsating sensation and you achieve this by pressing your flat tongue against her clit and elongating your tongue so that it’s pointed. We also love when you suck it and gently pull away at the same time.  When you’re ready to take this all further, give her some finger, think p in the v but you’re also still going to be eating her out at the same time because simultaneous clitoral and vaginal stimulation is fireeeee.  Other than that have fun! We have fun when you enjoy eating us out. Give us some “mmms” while you’re down there. Tell us how yummy our cakes taste. The more fun you have the more fun we have. Plus when you give head so passionately to us it makes us want to do the same back to you. Please comment on your thoughts and further tips for going down on your ladies! Cheers and eat that cake cake cake cake ","This. Dear god, this. Also, some girls love it when you grab them by the hips and pull them closer to you as you go down on them. Also, breath like you're swimming, that way you can stay down there. Little tip I picked up from my fiance, who gives the best head I've ever gotten. ",2017
949s5v,"I started dating this girl about two weeks ago. She's awesome, duh. No need to explain personal opinions about partners. What i wanted to tell about was the first time we slept together and how her cute reaction during sex made it one of my favorite nights ever. Because of experience with other partners, getting me to cum had become a bit of a challenge from over stimulation over the years. Fast forward to my first night with new girl. We've been going at it for a while. She knows her body and gotten her fill and is now trying to satisfy me. She starts going down on me and is doing amazing things, but I just can't cum. I pull her up because I know she's getting a sore jaw. She sits up and gives me the most adorable pout and says, ""I want your jizz"". Not in a sexy way but in the same playful voice she used to get some extra chocolate when we went to the movies.  Sometimes sex is hot; sometimes it's kinky; sometimes it's silly. That night, sex was cute.","My partner and I have some pretty rough sex with a heavy emphasis on him dominating me and being forceful with me. Last weekend we were having sex and he just stops, pulls back, and honks my nose like a horn. Smiled kind of playfully and went right back at it in the smoothest transition ever.  I'll probably tell that story at our wedding.",1571
94s0nc,"I was 15 years old and he was 10 years older than me. He was handsome, charming, sweet and caring towards me. He approached me at the mall one day and told me I was gorgeous and I was so flattered, I was popular with boys my own age but I always thought I was too mature for them. The fact that a handsome older guy approached me made me delighted, I was instantly smitten with him!  He talked to me for a little bit and he asked my age, when I told him I was 15 he acted all surprised he thought I was older. I believed him because I always got told I looked older than my age as I’m latina so curves haha. He told me he was so sorry and pretended like he felt guilty because I was so young, I told him it was fine and he said he felt a connection with me and he wanted to be friends. We started texting non-stop, he’d flirt with me and then apologise and say he just couldn’t help himself because of how attracted he was to me. I was falling for him the more I talked to him and I was convinced he was a good guy.  We would hang out at the mall alot and he would always buy me things, I felt guilty taking it at first but he told me I deserved nice things and that he wanted me to have things that reminded me of him. I was falling for him and after a month of us being ‘friends’ it was me who made a move on him, I thought he was so sweet and the fact he didn’t try to come onto me made me not doubt his intentions at all. I kissed him one night and he told me that he wanted me but that he didn’t want to take advantage of my age. I begged him to try with me, that age is just a number and that the connection we have is special. His manipulation was working on me already and we started dating. My mom and dad guessed that I was seeing somebody but I didn’t tell them anything about him, I knew they wouldn’t understand and they would freak out about the age difference. (obviously). He started telling me things like if they really wanted me to be happy they wouldn’t care and how I am too mature to be treated like a child by my parents. I started to believe him and my relationship with my parents who I was always close with became very strained, we started arguing all of the time and I just wanted to be with him every minute of everyday. I became obsessed with him.  He asked me to be his girlfriend a month later and we started to be sexual. I lost my virginity to him and I thought it was perfect, he was so caring and loving and I knew I was in love with him after that. I would have done anything for him, he was perfect in my eyes. We started sleeping together regularly and there was nothing out of the ordinary, he told me he loved me and I couldn’t be happier. My relationship became more and more strained with my parents and after I turned 16 I left home and went to live with him, I dropped out of high school because he told me he would take care of me.  He made me tell my parents I was staying with a friend because they ‘wouldn’t understand’ so I did. I cut all contact with my family and my life revolved around him, looking back and typing this out I can’t believe I was so stupid but he manipulated me so badly I would have done anything for him, and I did.  Everything was perfect until about 2 months into me living with him. He introduced me to one of his friends, he was older than him and I didn’t like him. I thought he was creepy and he stared at me like I was a peice of meat. My boyfriend told me that he really likes me and hes so jealous that my boyfriend gets to be with me. He then told me that he asked him could he sleep with me and I thought he would be like no way, but he told me it would make him happy if I did. I was confused and freaked out at him and he told me that maybe I’m just too immature for an adult relationship and he made a mistake. I got upset and told him I’d do anything and he said ‘thats my girl’ and arranged for me to sleep with him. It was horrendous, I hated every second of it but I was so blinded by love and I thought that this was what I had to do, I didn’t realise that he was prostituting me out to this man it never even crossed my mind. After that, more and more ‘friends’ would be introduced to me and would want to sleep with me. He told me that it was because I’m so stunning and sexy that all men wanted to sleep with me and that he wanted me to enjoy myself with his friends. I became miserable, I hated what I was doing but I did it for him and I wanted to do it even if I hated it because that’s what you do when you love someone. That’s what he told me. I still niavely had no jdea he was prostituting me out to his friends. One night he told me one of his friends where coming over and I told him I didn’t want to do it tonight and I hated doing stuff with them. He gave me coke, told me it would make it feel better and would make me enjoy it more.  I started taking coke almost everyday, to numb the horrible feelings I felt inside of me day in and day out. He started making me do gang bangs and threesomes and if I refused he would hit me. He would tell me that it was all my fault and he wouldn’t have to do it if I just listened to him.  This went on for a year and a half, until one day the cops raided his apartment and they took me for questioning. They told me I had been groomed and I didn’t believe them, I told them that he loved me and that they where wrong. The police told me he was in charge of a prostitution ring and when they asked me did he ever make me have sex with other men I broke down. Only then did I realise what I had been doing. The police called my parents and they where distraught, they where looking for me everywhere and they didn’t know if I was even still alive. He got tried and him and all of his friends are in jail for a long time. No matter how long he’s in jail for it doesn’t take away that he took my childhood from me, my innocence and everything. I’ve had therapy since it happened and I’m feeling alot better, I finally have a boyfriend and I’m in a happy relationship. I have a job and I am going to college soon. This was 4 years ago and I will make sure that I have a good future and my life isn’t over. I wanted to write this because I wanted to share my story anonymously and I want people to know how easy it is to be groomed. I hope that if any young girls read this they will see how easy it is to be groomed and please not make the mistake I did. I still have my bad days and days where I feel guilt and shame wash over me, but over the years they have been less frequent. If you read all of this thanks for reading my story.  EDIT: Wow. Thankyou everyone for all of your lovely replies. I didn’t expect this post to blow up so much and such a positive response. I’m moved to tears by all of the kind comments and people telling me I’m strong is such an amazing feeling. I’ve felt weak for so long it means alot to me.

He panics and sends her home and keeps telling her to stop crying because it looks like he's raped her or something. Men. Please.

976gzv,[deleted],"THIS.it does sound like common sense but I had a guy I was in a relationship with forget that. I think guys don't notice that, because when you have irl sex both parties usually arouse each other during foreplay/making out and it's more or less simultaneous (although obviously not always). With pic swapping people usually start thinking about it when they're already turned on, and it's easy to not notice that the process of getting aroused did not involve their partner, so they might not be on the same page.",1158
97eqwn,"I see it come up a lot when people talk about finding places to have sex in public., but I've worked changing rooms and here is why it's a dick move. I know what you're doing. It's about as subtle as a teenage boy at a swimming pool, and everyone thinks they are getting away with it when in reality it can be for multiple reasons (not paid enough, social anxiety, actually don't care). This is a very sex positive sub Reddit, so it can be hard to remember that sex can make some people very uncomfortable and causing that discomfort to a stranger in public/at their place of work is really really rude. It's not just me, there are kids and families and just other people too. All of the above applies to them, and the more people the more likely one of them is going to have a bad time with it. Also could be taking a room someone could need for it's intended purpose. But you go when it's slower it puts more pressure on the attendant. What I don't know is the specifics. I don't know if you are full on having sex and wiping it on the clothes I'll later have to pick up. I don't know if she is going to swallow and leave no mess. I don't know what you did on that bench, and now I either have to get all up in that room to clean it, or let the little girl that comes after you sit on it to put on her pants. Sure, you might not be the rudest or messiest about it, but it's not like I know that. You are making your kinks my problem without my consent or any of the others around you. Also, those rooms are filthy af. And no, not getting caught isn't all that matters. It's about not putting others in a position they don't want to be in and that makes them uncomfortable. Definition of a dick move. Sure, say the odds of you getting caught are slim (not that every time people are caught they know about it.) you are determining for others that your pleasure is more important than the risks for making their day worse. Again, literally the definition of a dick move. Edit: Libraries, cinemas, and airplanes. These things apply to more than just retail workers, and in general just try to live life without being too much of a dick (or cunt). Edit 2: You can often tell a couple that is going in to have sex vs a couple that is going in to help disability or just to sit down and give opinions. Know that it may be against company policy because others have abused the privilege so don't get butt hurt if they don't let you. It's really nice to see the concerned replies from people wanting to make sure that it's still okay, but it's very likely that you are fine. For those of you that ask about only x act, or what about here or whatever, sure it might be better, but you are still trying to work around doing something rude by saying that you will do something slightly less rude.  Edit 3: Last edit. I do want to clarify that there is  absolutely nothing wrong with exhibition kink or fetish. This post is in no way meant to shame anyone or even accuse those that have done this of malice. I simply thought that the couples I do see coming into my fitting room hadn't fully realized our side  of things, and would like to save a lot of headache all around. Thanks everyone for the upvotes to get this seen. Gilded twice and showing up when you sort by top of all time (less than 24hrs no less) is pretty awesome.

9gabny,"I was in a four year long relationship and my ex was my first as well as the only dick I had seen. I thought it was good, I came and he could make me squirt but I wouldn't want sex to last very long with him because I would almost get bored. He never wanted to go down on me (despite me going down on him) and he didn't want to have sex veey often. We broke up and I started dating someone I already knew well. When I admitted to my new bf that I was attracted to him we made out for three hours (it felt like 45 min tops). I had never experienced such chemistry before. When we had sex he was everything I never really knew I wanted in bed. His dick alone curved perfectly into my body. He went primal when having sex and was vocal about what felt good. We spent a weekend together and had sex five times in 48 hours- as much as physcially possible for me. After sex he wanted to cuddle (something my ex said men aren't programmed to do).

9iusjk,"This is a technique to be used on vaginas, just FYI.  The following will contain parts that will likely make you say “well duh” but I considered it a huge eye-opening revelation.  Background on technique: it was in a recent post in I think /r/relationships and it was by a lesbian, who had perfected the art of fingering a girl, as she put it.  So I “took notes.” All my life, my “technique” was basically to use two fingers to mimic a penis thrusting in and out.  Do you do this? Stop. Because she may look like she’s enjoying it, but she’s not. And yeah the logic sounds like “well it’s something hard and stiff going in and out...” NO.  Rub her clit? Sure, it feels...nice, especially when done right. But nothing compares to the simple technique I learned from an anonymous lesbian who has obviously become an expert on pleasuring women.  **Here is what will literally drive your girl to the point of gyrating and dripping in your palms: fingering her with your middle finger, palm up, and simply rubbing her G-spot firmly (in pressure) but gently in speed in a CIRCULAR motion**.  That’s all.  It will turn her into a slip n slide down there if done right. My gf is in her 30s and has a good amount of sexual experience but even she felt like she had “unlocked” a new life experience.  It got to the point where she was screaming into pillows and losing 95% of bodily control. She had no recall of what her body was doing in reaction because the feeling itself was “pure ecstasy” to her, and her limbs were extending and clenching every which way (kind of like we men do when a blow job goes on for “too long”).  **TLDR — It May sound like remedial school on sex, but there IS not only a “proper” way of fingering a girl, but a way to drive her nuts. Just firmly and smoothly rub her G-spot in a slow, firm circular motion, and let the good times (and her juices) flow**. ","I've found many of my partners prefer a ""stroking"" motion against the gspot, so like the ""come over here"" motion you might make, with your fingertip(s) against her gspot. Just my 2cents!",2632
9jy03o,"A little bit of backstory and then the juicy stuff I have a condition called uterus didelphys. This means my reproductive system is split down the middle by a septum, creating two sides to everything. Two vaginal canals, two cervixes, two uteri, which lead to their own fallopian tube and ovary. Having sex for the first time BEFORE surgery was very worrisome, I was worried the septum in my vagina would tear and to be quite honest, sex didn't feel good for me. I never came vaginally and looking back, I understand why I didn't. At the end of July I decided to have the septum retracted in my vagina to form one canal. The surgery was non-invasive but the recovery period was about a month and a half. During this time I completely evaded my vagina, I masturbated very infrequently, and going off to college and leaving my boyfriend reaffirmed that I wouldn't be having sex for a while. Flash forward through a breakup, some tears, and a lot of confusion and I found myself a really great guy. I told him about my situation and how I needed my ""first second time"" to go slow because I wasn't sure if there would be pain, how it would feel, if I could get hurt, etc.  SO, we had sex last night/this morning, and LEMME TELL YOU SOMETHIN. I FEEL LIKE A BRAND NEW WOMAN! I essentially lost half of my virginity because like damn I was missing out. Compared to before I had surgery, the feeling I had during sex was about 10-20% of the feeling now. And he was able to get to my G-Spot! AND I CAME VAGINALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING SEX!!! If you took all of the times I had sex before the surgery and added them up, they wouldn't add up to how last night felt. It got to the point where it felt so good that it hurt because I wasn't used to how much feeling I had down there.

I was on the bed, on my knees with my chest and face down on the bed (butt in the air) so I couldn't see him. Well, he got his gun out of the nightstand and put it inside of me. I asked what it was and he asked if I liked it. I pulled away and flipped around and it was in his hand and he was laughing! I told him that was fucked up and he said it wasn't loaded but I don't believe him. Did he go too far or was it my fault for saying he could use (almost) anything? I honestly never even thought about the gun otherwise I would have told him not to use it. I'm kind of angry at him over this. **Thank you for all of the replies, I appreciate the advice and supportive comments very much.

9nmx9b,"As a female I cannot express the frustration of hooking up with a guy and the guy just tries to slip the dick in without protection. And when you try and say “no, not without a condom” you are faced with opposition and an argument. If I say no, use a condom, that should be it. Use a condom.  TWICE I have had this encounter with guys where they didn’t want to use a condom but took it even further. Despite the conversation and my hard stance on having safe sex (especially since they were both Tinder guys) they BOTH (separate encounters) proceeded to do it anyways. I pulled them out of me and tried to hold my ground about no unprotected sex. They continue to beg and try and persuade me. One even waited a few seconds and then put it back in anyways! After I took it out!  I don’t care if you don’t like using condoms or if it doesn’t feel as good or you can’t finish as easily. If you are sleeping with a stranger and they ask you to use a condom just do it or go home. Don’t argue. Don’t beg. Don’t ask for “just a minute” and then you’ll put one on.

9o27xa,"I know that r/sex tends to dislike those who fake orgasms - ""you're lying to your partner"" ""they deserve to know"" etc. and though I believe these arguments are fair, I feel as though all the emphasis is placed on how our partner feels. No one seems to want to ask *why* people fake orgasms in the first place. I feel like this is important to understand, and would kindly like to ask you to please read this to get some understanding of our side too. I lost my virginity to my current boyfriend a little over a year ago.  I was a sexual person before that (masturbated every day or two, averaging two orgasms per session), so when I started having sex, I came every time. One day, I decided I'd switch to oral birth control (we tried various condoms, none of them were comfortable to him, and he couldn't come with them on. Our country doesn't exactly offer a wide variety of condoms either). My sex drive took a nose dive. We were long-distance for about 2 months when I started taking them, and by the time we started doing it again and the BC kicked in, I just enjoyed sex less, had less orgasms, and didn't want to do it as often. Boyfriend started initiating nearly 100% of the time, and I went from having an orgasm all the time to half of the time. Now, my BF is a wonderful, understanding, kind person. I love him to bits. I explained that this was because of my birth control, and he understood, but you can tell that it did hurt his ego, and subconsciously it still bothered him. I don't blame him. Pornography has conditioned us to believe that everyone comes every time - women come several times too! And if your partner doesn't react that way, then you suck at sex, because hey, here's a million videos that show you that sex is exactly like that! Though most people realize that porn is an unrealistic presentation of sex, after being exposed to it for several years (as many people are), it's hard for it to not influence ones perception of sex, at the very least subconsciously. ***You know when you can rationally explain something to yourself, but emotionally and subconsciously it still makes you feel bad?  It's that.*** Ask anyone who has a hard time coming (and that has had partners that care about their pleasure) how their partner(s) react to being told that they just can't come. I've read so many posts here along the lines of ""My SO/FWB can't come, and though they said they're just like that, it makes me feel bad!"". Often, our partners then either make it a mission to make us come, which just makes us frustrated, or the sex gets worse because they don't feel as confident in themselves anymore. So I sometimes fake it. I fake it because after half an hour/45mins of sex my legs and vagina hurt but he insists on going because he wants to make me come even though I said I can't. I fake it because he needs extra reassurance that I enjoyed it when he finishes before me because he feels bad. I fake it because he thinks that I'm no longer as attracted to him as I was before since I'm not initiating/enjoying sex as much as I was before. I fake it because sex becomes much less enjoyable when I feel like I'm under pressure to have an orgasm, because there are negative consequences if I don't - hurting my SO. He, through his expression of displeasure that i cannot cum, is unintentionally punishing me - but that is punishment nonetheless. It's great to care abut your partner's pleasure, but please, this is *not* how you do it, and far too many people take this approach. For the love of *God, if your partner says they cannot come,* ***believe them. Don't be offended. Don't pressure them. Don't take it as a personal offence, because you are making sex worse for both yourself and your partner.*** ***No one can truly enjoy sex when they feel like they're under pressure.*** &#x200B; Having pleasurable sex is something that requires the consent, patience, understanding, acceptance and communication/honesty of all parties. **You have the right to demand honesty from your partner as much as they have the right to demand understanding and acceptance from you. It's not good to be the SO that fakes orgasms, but it's just as bad to be the SO that can't accept that their partner cannot come, and try to force them/pressure them into doing so.** &#x200B; I'm very willing to hear peoples thoughts on this. Once more: I am not supporting faking orgasms, I am simply trying to explain to people why we sometimes do it. Thank you for reading, and I wish you a wonderful day :) Small edit: This is a post made for those who are in otherwise healthy relationships, and for those whose partner has communicated to them that they do not always come in bed. If your partner faked orgasms without trying to talk to you about this first, then that is another situation. One more thing I want to add since some people seem to be commenting on this (reposting a comment i made below):  I've started to fix this problem by placing emphasis on the fact that I enjoy the non-orgasmic part of sex, and to tell him that I think the sex was great after we have a session where I don't come (both of which are true, outside of this issue he is a really amazing partner, in and out of the bedroom). So far that's been going well. Things are getting better, and I we're on the way to making sex even more enjoyable for us both :) I will also try to respond to comments, since I think that this is an interesting and important discussion to have, but I might not be able to respond to them right away due to me not having access to internet, or me sleeping :P To add: *this post is intended to be gender neutral* , women are not the only ones who have been in this situation. &#x200B; Also wow! Thank you for the gold! This isn't my main account, so I'm not really in it for the karma - but I'm really happy at the amount of attention this post has been getting because I feel that this is something worth noting and discussing. It's great knowing I managed to help and give insight to so many people! Lots of love!","To add to your point, I had to explain to my boyfriend that just because I cum doesn't mean I am sexually satisfied and just because I don't doesn't mean I'm not. I can have sex and not cum and be twice as satisfied as the last time when I did. Not exactly sure why, but that's how it is for me. But sometimes when were done and cuddling after he'll mention it and seem upset...even if I was just talking about how good I feel. To me, cumming isnt the ultimate goal. With sex, it is more important for me to feel connected to the person, loved, and like they feel loved, and in the end satisfaction. If satisfaction is only obtained by my partner cumming, then that is fina and that becomes my end goal, but for me, thats not how it works. ",1646
9re167,"I (32 M) have been dating this amazing girl (31F) for 5 months. It’s embarrassing to admit but I have a micro penis, it’s just shy of 3” when hard.  My self esteem and confidence related to my penis have really impacted my dating life, my current gf is only the 2nd sexual partner I have had. After dating a couple weeks I told her I wanted to take it slow, she agreed. Last week I told her I had a small penis and that’s why I wanted to take it slow, she told me she didn’t care about the size of my penis, but we’ll go at what ever pace I’m comfortable at.  On the weekend we had Sex for the first time, I went down on her until she came, then she gave me a bit of a blow job and told me she wanted to ride me. So I laid down and she did, she alternated between riding me and just grinding on me, she really seemed to enjoy the grinding. I really liked it too and came. The next morning I was in the shower, when I came out she was on the phone with her Bff, I have met her. And they were talking about sex. My heart sank, I was just waiting for her to tell her friend all about how small I am.  That didn’t happen. She told her that we had *finally* had sex, she used the word ‘amazing’ to describe it. She told her I was amazing at oral and said “and you know how I feel about oral” (she also told me how she feels about oral and that it’s really important to her) she also told her friend it was the first time she had had an orgasm during a ‘first time’  not once did she mention my small size, she didn’t give away any real intimate details, she just told her how much she enjoyed it.  I was always scared that any girl I dated would share with her friends my lack of endowment, but I guess I didn’t have to.  Some girls do talk, but that’s okay.

9sxewg,"Um, this is kinda venting? But I'm genuinely looking for advice on how to deal with this.

We've been together for 3 years and we've always got along and I feel like we've been able to trust each other. The past few months he's just been pushy and snappier with me, and I didn't understand why he wouldnt tell me what was wrong. I finally got him to open up and he basically told me that he didnt like the way our sex life was going downhill, with which he meant that he doesn't like having sex with me because my injuries are a turn off. I thought I misunderstood him but he clarified my injuries make him feel like he's having sex with someone ""damaged"" and that apparently I ""make him uncomfortable."" I have to say, I feel nothing short of worthless right now, I've tried so hard to accept who I am and he just crushed me.

9u5g2x,"  I’ve been thinking about writing this for a while, and since this sub just had its bi-monthly “Would you have sex with a trans person?” thread I figured I’d strike while the iron was hot.   I’m a 24-year-old bisexual trans woman. I’ve been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for just over a year now. I have not had vaginoplasty and don’t plan on it. When I can afford to, I really want to get an orchiectomy, but that’s sadly not going to be for a while. I had a steady girlfriend for nearly 7 years pre-transition. Nowadays I have a boyfriend I’ve been seeing for 6 months.   HRT has radically changed everything about the way I experience sex. Arousal feels different, the physical sensation of arousal is something completely new to me. It used to be like, I’d see something hot and my brain would go “yeah that’s fuckin hot bro,” I’d get hard and go take care of it. The old urge to masturbate was just one of those things that’d pop up regularly. I could be sitting around doing nothing, and in the same way one would passively think “oh I’m hungry I’ll go eat,” when I was a dude I’d just randomly think “huh, I’m horny, I’ll go jerk off.” Now when I get turned on I feel it *everywhere.* I’ll lose my breath for a second, a jolt will run through me from the bottom up, and I’ll *physically* feel an intense need to be touched.   The old up-and-down motion of jerking off doesn’t work for me anymore. Erections are rare and sometimes hurt, and maintaining an erection for the whole duration of sex/masturbation is nearly impossible. I use a vibrator on the head/frenulum area to get off, or I’ll push my un-erect dick down against my scrotum and gently rub it in circles. It feels frickin’ amazing, trust me. My junk smells exactly like pussy. I have a dark purple stripe on the underside of my penis. I found out that estradiol (the hormone I take) darkens the labia of cis women who take it, and that’s the part of my junk that would have been my labia had I been born a girl. Neat-o, right? Male orgasms are so short my goodness. I guess the stimulation used to feel kind of good throughout, but it was mostly in an effort to achieve that brief skyrocket of intensity at orgasm. Nowadays I have a pretty difficult time actually orgasming, but it doesn’t matter because everything builds up more slowly and feels more intense throughout. I’m more sensitive to being touched anywhere now, not even in just a sexual context, but especially in a sexual context. My chest is so sensitive that I’ll moan and whimper just from my bf massaging my boobs, or rubbing my thighs, or breathing warmly against my neck. When I do orgasm, the high from it lasts much longer afterwards. One time I came so hard I laid on top of my boyfriend for nearly ten minutes after unable to catch my breath. I barely produce any cum anymore.   My taste in porn has changed entirely since starting my transition. I used to watch a lot of vanilla, live-action straight porn and I can’t enjoy it even slightly anymore. I used to use porn as like a masturbation aid, to keep me turned on while I took care of the random urges my brain would send out. I’m 100% only into reading hentai and porn doujinshi these days. Most of the time I don’t even masturbate while reading it, but the feeling of arousal feels good enough on its own that I enjoy it.   Back when I was living as a dude who had a girlfriend, I was rather low-libido and we’d only have sex a few times a month. Sometimes it’d feel romantic and amazing and I’d enjoy it a lot, but other times I’d feel uncomfortable and disappointed with myself in a way I couldn’t describe (which I now know was dysphoria). What I enjoyed most about it was her pleasure, because mine was pretty minimal. I’d masturbate somewhat regularly, but only because I felt like I had to, and definitely less than the male friends I’ve discussed these types of things with. Since a couple months into HRT though, I’m constantly horny and craving physical affection.   TL;DR: “feminine penis” is a real thing, believe the memes. Sorry if I grossed out or offended anyone with my choice of language.",As a straight woman this actually helps explain sex between my husband and myself (and previous male partners). I like a lot of foreplay and believe it can be an all day event (not just touching me but emotionally and lightly physically stimulating). Most men haven’t seemed to grasp this but your explanation hit it on the head. Thanks. ,1671
9uc5u8,"From the title of my post, I hope you can get an understanding of what I'm talking about.  I've noticed more and more people I have sex with, girls and guys (I'm bisexual), smell like ass when they get naked.  Let me explain. I've been with my now current girlfriend for almost a year.  She's awesome and we both are bisexual.  We are both in our late 30s and I guess you can call us swingers.  We both are also big on fitness and hygiene.  Friday night we hooked up with another fit couple who we had to say No because of bad hygiene.   From the outside with clothes on, they looked good.  They were funny and flirtatious.  But once the clothes came off and we all started to get close, you could smell the stench of butt around their body.  That's a big turn off.  Me and the lady had to make an excuse and we didn't fully commit that night. Let this be a PSA:  Please use moist wipes or take a shower before sex.  The last thing I want is to have sex with someone who smells like they just took a shit....smh",You don’t even need to do a complete shower. Just wash your asshole with a washcloth and soap.

I don’t know how grown adults live like this. ,3347
9urkj5,"I've seen this pretty frequently. Referring to sex as something to ""get"" or that you ""give"" someone, like a treat you would give a child that ate all their dinner. I personally think that this is a pretty damaging way to look at sex. Sex is a *bond* between two people, an intimate thing to *share* with someone. Not something that your boyfriend ""gets"" once a week, or what have you.  I see this from time to time and i just shutter and cringe when I read it or hear it. And it usually comes from women. I don't think I've ever heard a guy say he gives his gf sex. Maybe guys say it too, I've just never heard it.  It's an unhealthy way of looking at things.  Being able to have a healthy life is a really important part of being an adult. I *did not* say 'having a healthy sex' life is important, I said the ability to have a healthy sex life is. Otherwise you will most likely fight an uphill battle in your long term relationships. And thinking of sex in a healthy way is a great place to start.  Thinking it's an object to ""give"" and ""get"" is a poor place to start.   Just my 2 cents. Thank you for reading","If you **give** me sex, then you don't **want** sex with me.  If you don't **want** sex with me, then I don't want sex with you. And without sex, the relationship is over.

We were discussing stuff to do, and he asked to clarify that I had zero feeling in my legs. Be then asked if he could try cutting me and minor mutilation play(what he called it) I was not expecting that and changed the subject really fucking quick. So holy shit I didn't expect my bf to ask to literally mutilate me to get off. Being honest, I'm actually kinda scared now knowing that the thought of doing that to me arouses him.

a1g3zy,"So I slept with one of my best friends this weekend for the 2nd time. The first time we did was a month ago after we’d been out drinking, and it was very... tender?

He has such a genuine personality and the most warm smile... it felt really good being with him that night, and it hasn’t messed up our friendship at all.  We live in different cities, and haven’t had a chance to hang out since then. When we saw each  other this weekend, I was really hoping it would happen again but I wasn’t sure if he was feeling it. We went out with a group of friends, and when we were at the bar he started by gently brushing my arm and whispering in my ear - talking about what he would do to me when we get home, how he was going to make me dripping wet, how my body was driving him wild... it was so hot hearing him breathe these sentences in my ear and still having to act normal in front of everyone.  It escalated for a few hours, and by the time we started kissing I felt like I was going to explode! His hands were so warm, he knew exactly where to touch me. Just as we were about to start having sex, he grabbed my face and said “I’m going to be a bit rough, is that okay?” FUCK. I melted.  This second time was so different from the first. He completely took control and held me down on the bed, sometimes he’d choke me or cover my mouth. It was so fucking hot seeing this cute, polite boy transform into a dominant, powerful machine haha.

a2u8zq,"I’ve always seen orgasms as a plus when it came to sex, not the end game. It’s all about the journey for me.  Having the warmth of another person in bed with you. The intimacy. The exploration of their bodies. It can be playful and lighthearted or intense and passionate. Soft and gentle, hard and rough, etc. There’s a lot of variety and it’s always a fun experience.  I get that orgasms feel pretty awesome, and I certainly *try* to bring my partner to orgasm - but I don’t put pressure on myself or on her to do so. Especially since so few women actually cum during PIV. I do the best I can, I give enthusiastic oral since that’s my favorite act, and women have a better chance of cumming from oral - but, again...it’s not the be all end all.  And I don’t say that selfishly. I don’t cum every single time either. It’s actually closer to 50/50 because I’m not focused on reaching orgasm. I don’t guilt my partner or pressure them to get me to cum. If I cum, awesome, if not, whatever. If I get blue balls as a result, I’ll just masturbate to drain the pipes.  Which is the whole focus when I masturbate *anyway.* If it’s just me and my hand, *obviously* the goal is to cum. But I just don’t see that same objective in sex.  I’m wondering how many men/women genuinely enjoy the act of sex itself and all that comes with it, regardless of whether or not they orgasm, and how many can only truly enjoy sex if they orgasm.",Same.

It’s hard to explain but I feel like I’m always just seen as ‘asian’ not like anything else and it’s just so annoying.    This kind of thing has followed me into adulthood. I can kinda suss out the guys now that just want me cause I’m Asian, like I was on tinder for a little bit and guys would message me straight away and start talking about anime and just general asian stuff it’s so annoying. Like preference is fine, if you find Asian girls attractive there’s nothing wrong with that but please don’t think the only thing you can talk to me about is anime and video games. Oh and calling me Kawaii   But the worst like the actual worst is when guys I think are okay and then I hook up with them and I see they’ve just fetishised me because I’m a little Asian girl.

a4x1n6,"We generally get up early-ish, from 6am to 8. Kids (7yo twins) get up at about 7:30 to 8. Sometimes our work and household duties leave us completely devastated and even though maybe I have had the itch for sex since leaving home in the morning, some days I don't have the energy for sex, and the same happens to him. So we started having sex at around 6 to 7 on Saturdays. It wasn't planned, one day we both woke up feeling energetic and went at it and it felt great. That hour and a half window gives us enough time for a sexy session and a shower later before the kids even wake up. I don't know about you but wanting to have sex through the day and not doing it gets me grumpy. Starting the day with sex feels great and I generally feel sexually satisfied for about 24 hours or more if I enjoyed the sex. So, this might not be for you because you work the night shift or you like to get up late or you don't have kids so you can fuck whenever, but it helped us. We have been doing it regularly for about 3 months and it makes me feel... balanced, maybe? It's not exactly spontaneous (in fact, quite the opposite) but looking forward to sex on a Saturday morning feels pretty good and I love his puffy morning face and disheveled look, and the cold shower after doesn't hurt either. So yeah, take it or leave it. But for us it works pretty well, of course we fuck over the week, but the crazy duties drain your energy sometimes, and waking up fresh to fuck is pretty heavenly.",Wow. What's it like to have kids who sleep?,2370
a5mukg,"This is probably not the right sub to put this on, but I thought I should put it out there anyways because I'm so angry. One of my guy friends was telling me about this girl he hooked up with and how she was being dumb and annoying after. He chose to go without a condom with a random while she wasn't on any birth control, and although he didn't cum in her, she was worried about being pregnant for a week after (yes, precum can get you pregnant). He told me how annoying and irritating she was and texting him nonstop because of the fear. I was so frustrated because he played a equal role in not being safe and he blamed her for being clingy after. Please use protection and stay safe. Edit: For those of you of wondering why I called him out and not her, it’s because he’s told me before he refuses to have sex with a condom. His ex gf who he dated in hs too said that he would refuse to perform the deed with protection and then get angry at her and accused of her seeking attention when she feared she might be pregnant at times.  We’re also not very close, he just got too drunk the other day and told me everything.",I tell everyone this regularly: I was told I could not have children. I had unprotected sex once. 9 months and two days later I had a daughter.  Always use protection. ALWAYS. ,2167
a61q3l,"The other day I tweeted about how much I fancy a shag, after quite a few months now of being single. And it’s true, to put it bluntly, I am really fucking desperate for sex.  So I got to wondering why that is, what am I actually desperate for? I’m pretty fucking fiercely independent, a strong believer that I have every skill I need to achieve my goals in life. And as a feminist I dislike the idea of being dependent on a man for anything...  Don’t get my wrong. I love many men, and I love the idea of eventually being in a relationship where I am an equal partner in a loving team, but that’s not what I’m talking about here. I’m talking about the physical craving for affection and, specifically, for sex.  So what am I actually craving... why do I need a man? It’s not the physical pleasure of sexual stimulation and orgasm. I can achieve that easily from masturbation, but though that relieves the short term urge, it doesn’t fulfil my longer term craving for sex. So I figured I’d try to make a list: - Kissing. I miss the feeling and closeness of making out. You can’t simulate that, it’s something that needs another human mouth (and it’s something that too few people are really good at. A really underrated skill!).  - I miss the excitement of knowing I’m going to have sex. The feeling of desire, and the way that builds when I’m with someone. There is absolutely nothing like sitting in a restaurant with some guy I really fancy, looking at his face and knowing he’s going to be inside me later. I just can’t get that excited about going home to have a wank.  - Crudely, I crave the weight of a man on top of me. When I fantasise about sex, that’s another physical sensation I try to imagine in my head.  - I want the closeness, the shared pleasure, the bond that comes from making the journey to orgasm with another person. There’s nothing quite like it.  - I miss _giving_ pleasure. Obviously I enjoy the physical sensation of being touched and licked, but when I masturbate my fantasies are much more likely to involve giving oral sex than receiving it. I love watching a guy’s face as I bring him to orgasm, knowing I’m the one who got him there.  - I love the feeling of being strongly desired. When I’m with a guy, the way he looks at me, his reaction when he sees me naked, the feeling of a guy getting hard as we make out. It’s powerfully erotic. That moment when a guy is just like, ‘I need to fuck you now!’... wow - it’s a drug, that one.  - I want to wake up next to a guy and feel his body alongside mine, knowing that we’re about to have sex. There’s nothing quite like being turned on by the physical presence of another human body.  - I want the fun of seeing a guy naked for the first time! That lovely excitement of meeting someone, flirting and wondering what his body is going to look like... So yeah, there you go. That’s my list. I’m sure I’ve forgotten stuff but that’s what is running through my head right now. (And yes, it’s 5am and a quick wank will likely stop me thinking about a lot of it and mean I can go back to sleep!) I kinda hate the fact that I’m so dependent on a man for this, that it’s one thing I can’t do on my own. But there it is... for all that I’d love a boyfriend, I have to admit that at the moment, I’d settle for a good shag.  Those of you who are single, it would be interesting to know how your list compares to mine. Particularly guys... what is it you crave about sex? Cheers all!","The weight one is weirdly my favorite. Even while just cuddling, when he lays on top of me and it makes it a little harder to breathe so all I’m aware of is his body on top of mine, is literally heaven to me. Overall, good list and I agree with every single one. Made me crave sex while in bed alone ",1337
a6nx3t,"New account because sensitive info, bad formatting because mobile. Slutty in the title is not meant derogatory.  So up until the start of this year, I’ve been in long-term committed relationships. I’ve also had a lot of self-esteem issues and a history of depression and self-harm. It always felt like these issues made me harder to love, so I wasn’t exactly picky with my relationships.  I broke up with my last boyfriend because I felt things weren’t working out and I couldn’t see myself with him for the rest of my life. I wanted freedom.  Fast forward to October of this year. I have my first one-night-stand. The guy was hot and the sex was good. But I also freaked out a little on the inside. Would he see my scars on my hips? Would he call me a freak? We hooked up twice more after that. I had pretty deep conversations with him and he surprisingly gave me some welcome insights into my life. He never noticed my scars. And he said what I needed wasn’t a good boyfriend/girlfriend, but first I needed good friends. So I started focusing more on my friendships and they are growing into beautiful strong bonds.  Since then I’ve hooked up with multiple guys. The first guy after him had mental health issues himself, so again I brought up my scars. He never noticed them either. After that, I didn’t even talk about those issues. Not a single guy has noticed my scars.  These parts of my body I used to focus on so much aren’t what other people focus on. They grab my butt, they compliment my boobs. If I tell them I feel uncomfortable with something, they immediately listen.  I used to be a kinky person, but my first boyfriend didn’t respect my boundaries and I got scared of trying more kinky stuff after that. Now I am exploring that side again with this one guy and I can trust him to immediately stop when I tell him to.  I’m learning to see myself as a person that people like and desire. I don’t have to just accept anyone. And I’m also having a lot of great sex.  For anyone concerned: yes, I’m being safe. Whenever I meet up with someone, there’s always one friend who knows when and where. I’m going to get tested for STDs soon.  EDIT: oh man, I did not expect this to blow up as much as it did! First of all: thank you to everyone sending me messages and reacting with their stories. So much power and love to you all! Some important corrections: 1. I am not saying you should sleep around when you hate yourself. I broke up with my last boyfriend in February and went on a intense journey to self-love. My first one-night-stand happened only after I realized I quite liked myself most of the time. After I could get up in the morning with more than enough energy to eat breakfast, shower and be productive.  2. I used the word “slutty” for a few reasons. One, the title was already long enough imo and “slutty” is shorter than “sexually free/active”. Secondly, I use it as a sort of reclaimed word. I like it. It feels sexy. But yes, sexually free is way more accurate.  3. I’m not saying that I have to give up sex for a good partner. Or at least, I had a poor choice of words. I used to gladly give up sexual pleasure for the “right personality”. I’m not going to do that ever again. So asking myself “are you willing to give up great sex for that guy/girl?” helps. And of course the only answer I’ll accept is: “You won’t be giving up anything, because that person checks all the boxes” EDIT 2: I feel like there are some things I need to clarify even more: 1. To all the incels and slutshamers, I’m not just letting guys use me. I’m bisexual. It’s just way easier to hook up with guys because of societal reasons. Most guys on Tinder look for sex, most girls look for romantic dates.  My self-esteem was already up a lot when I got my first one-night-stand.  2. To all the people who are still deep in their depression: DON’T DO THIS. You are understandably angry. I didn’t want to detail my whole recovery, just the sex part. Before the sex part there was a whole lot more I did to recover from depression. I went abroad for a semester, I have made close friends, I went on a solo-trip for 4 days, I graduated from my bachelor’s degree and am now doing my master’s. With some other students I started a student society for creative writing. If I would tell 15-year old me where I am now (without the sex part) she just wouldn’t believe me.  This is terrible advice on its own for severely depressed people, because I’m not severely depressed anymore and it’s not the only thing I did to improve my mental health. I worked really hard. And sometimes my effort didn’t pay off and I was excluded time and time again from friend groups and ended up in less than ideal relationships. I have a friend who is deeper into her depression still and she also sometimes sleeps around and this often backfires for her. Because her first reaction when someone doesn’t text back is “Oh no, everyone leaves” and my first reaction has become: “Their loss” I’m sorry if I made it seem like I was still deep in my depression. The sex has just consolidated my recovery. It didn’t cause it. ","It's not being slutty that helped you. It's finding decent human beings. I've seen so many cases of people (and for this specific scenario it's usually woman) who get into fucked up relationships, abusive ones or cheating ones and then come out of it feeling like it's their fault or thinking that they don't deserve better. Even more destructive if you already have some self estime troubles. Op please, just keep loving yourself and know that there are a lot of other people out there who will love whole for what you are.

a706vb,"Hello all. I am a 30M living with my 31F partner; I was raped by another man of my own family when I was a little boy. I won't list all of my disorders, but I can't have sex without meds. I didn't have any kind of sexual relationships until I met my actual girlfriend two years ago (in a group therapy FYI) because I was way too shy and afraid; I barely had any friends back then, so you know, girlfriends was only a dream. I only started seeing a therapist when I was in college and that really improved my quality of life. My partner is also a rape/incest victim, and not really sex-driven so most of the time we just cuddle and it's okayish for me because I still have light haphephobia (fear of being touched). We had sex approximatively 8 times this year, which is by far my personal record. We also try without meds, because I have the great hope to achieve this one day, but so far I can only achieve severe panic attacks. Our sexual relations are ok, I guess, but I'm not really good at it; I need about one hour of non-sexual foreplay to feel confident and relaxed enough, and I think that's what she really enjoys too. Thanks for reading this, don't mind asking me anything Edit: Thanks all of you for your kind and useful replies, I really appreciate it","Thank you so much for sharing this. It takes more courage than I can imagine to face things head on in the manner you are. It is also wonderful that you have a partner that knows, understands, and is patient with you in that regard, and vice versa.  It’s refreshing and recalibrating to get reminders that sex is not all about the act itself or the exciting taboo involved, but the intimacy it takes between those involved to truly reinforce the connection they share on many levels. Once again, thank you, and continue fighting for your yourself!",1281
aaffj4,"So, this is what happened to me (23f) today. My lovely SO asked me do I masturbate infront of a mirror and have I ever tried it, which I haven't. He asked me have I ever seen how my body moves, and changes during arousal, which I haven't. He asked have I ever seen with a mirror how things that feel good to me look like, I haven't. He asked me when was the last time I saw my vagina, I said that I don't remember. Which made me think. How can I guide him to do to my body what I like when I am not even sure how areas that give me pleasure look like, or where touches that make me feel good really land.  So I took a mirror and looked at my pussy. I was in shock! It was not the pussy that I remember looking at, the last time that I have looked at it closely, maybe three or four years ago. It's not that it looked bad or anything, it looked like any other normal pussy that is slightly more on the meatier side. But obliviously vaginas do grow up, as the rest of our bodies do and change over time. As my face, hair or arms have changed in the last couple of years, so has my vagina - I've just haven't looked at it, and it missed me.  Don't let yourself get so much out of touch with your body, take the mirror and you might find a slightly different vagina then you remember having.",It's insane how much they change with arousal too!,1275
abi57w,"Every time I feel a guy orgasming, I feel so powerful. Then for some reason, no matter how long they actually lasted, out comes some kind of apology for how they ""usually arent like this"" or ""sorry"". An apology and guilt is literally the last thing I want to hear from a guy who just came from my actions! When im still hella riled up and fuzzy! Its an instant turn off and kills my enjoyment of the afterglow or still ongoing sexual moment. I know that for some reason society focuses the entire act of sex on just penis insertion into vaginas and shames men for not witholding their orgasm. This is wrong and bad.  The correct response is to immediately reach down and start rubbing the clit of who you are with if you really feel you came sooner than youd like and she didnt get off. If you came, im sure she would LOVE to hear how her pussy got you off so quick and how good she is as you do this. Not one woman is going to complain about this.  If you arent up to it in your instant post orgasmic bliss, give it 20 minutes and go again! The stereotype of women being annoyed at men who last 1 minute comes from the fact that usually men just roll over and go to sleep and stop touching her when he orgasms, ending the whole affair and leaving her hanging. In general, please dont enter the self-guilt trip for reaching orgasm between the thighs of your parter. Or down their throat. That IS the objective of sex, after all. Healthier attitudes will improve your sex more than berating yourself every time you cum in less than 20 minutes or some crazy number. edit:  To the other women here saying you are disappointed when he finishes too quick, please tell me what you want to happen. Yall are missing the point. Men are going to cum fast sometimes, fact of biology. One response is for them to immediately feel guilty, say some ashamed apology to you, and roll over. The other option is to make it sexy and try again later. Not sure why you would prefer option A in any scenario unless you enjoy humiliation. This post says ""you dont need to apologize or express shame immediately after cumming because of your own body"" not ""no woman needs PIV and men should all be minutemen"". And people who specifically make mean comments at you are people you dont want to waste time with anyway. Goes for both sexes.",Yo. From a guys perspective thanks for this. I often feel like I'm letting my partner down cause I don't last very long at times and it makes me feel guilty. ,2024
aclt89,Okay so I recently decided to live out a fantasy of mine with my girlfriend. I decided to buy a remote control vibrator. &#x200B; For the entire day she wore it in her panties and I had the controller. i could tease her with it and watch her face change. We went into town and walked around the whole time she is buzzing. Sometimes it looked like she was going to fall over. At one point we were eating and our waitress asked us how our food was while she had her face buried into my shoulder as she was climaxing and was trying not to make it too obvious. I had to explain that she just wasn't feeling very well (lol).    By the end of the day she told me she'd never been that wet for that amount of time and went down on me. Being in control secretly for the whole day ended up turning me on so much that when I came in her mouth it was so much that she almost choked and said it was also the biggest load from me she'd ever seen. &#x200B; Definitely a massive turn on for both of us. I'd recommend trying a remote control vibrator for anyone looking for a little fun.,What remote vibe did you use?,578
advl1k,"I thought I’d share this, in hopes that it will make someone out there feel better.  My boyfriend and I have a wonderful sex life. We get better and better as time goes on. We’ve been together for six years. (Met in HS, so we’ve had sex for about four years now. Makes it better since we’ve been together for so long) However, he’s really only made me orgasm once a bit. I never really let him know until fairly recently. I never lied about it exactly, but I felt that if he knew about it then he would be crushed, and I genuinely had a good time and didn’t mind. I felt very content, satisfied, and extremely happy. Whenever I told him, he was grateful for the truth, but was understandably feeling inadequate. I explained to him that I really did love our sex life and I don’t feel like I need to orgasm all the time. It’s why I haven’t said anything. He’s wonderful, my body is just very picky. Orgasm does not always equal great sex. In fact, **sometimes I don’t even want to orgasm. I just like the pleasure and connection.** Of course, I will have moments where I want to orgasm. This doesn’t make the sex any less enjoyable at all. I do have a toy, and I masturbate. He even helps me a lot of the time, and we’ve broken it down to a science. He helps me have bigger orgasms by playing around with me while I masturbate, and I absolutely love it. So, I’m not going to speak for every single girl of the world, but I know there are more than just me out there. In fact, **my boyfriend can’t even climax every time, and that’s okay!** Therefore, people of reddit, please keep in mind that it really is quite possible that your SO loves having sex with you and feels happy and satisfied even if he/she doesn’t orgasm often or at all. EDIT: I agree with some of you who say there are other ways to have sex other than PIV :) My goal was to let some guys out there know that just because some girls need some assistance from toys etc, and he’s not “doing it himself”, that doesn’t mean he didn’t help make her orgasm. **It still counts even if you feel like it doesn’t, if she says that she enjoyed herself.** EDIT 2: If you are the type of man or woman who *needs* orgasms in order to feel fulfilled and content, then **communicate**. I did not mean to imply that you had to get over it and just accept your loss. This post is for a lot of women whom I know exist who have communicated with their SO about enjoying sex, and their SO doesn’t buy it because they weren’t able to properly make them orgasm without assistance.  EDIT 3: Holy crap. Y’all. Yes, **care about your partners needs and at least ask them what they want and make a good effort**. In no way shape or form am I saying that guys should forget about making her orgasm. Not being sexist. I am clearly a woman who also wishes to have a fulfilling sex life. I’m saying if the guy, or girl, is trying really hard and feels like crap, after you have **communicated** about the issue and you say you don’t mind, then I would like to reassure some guys or girls that **for some people, it truly doesn’t matter, particularly if you have communicated it**. If you are in a relationship where he or she does not care about your pleasure and this post may “reinforce bad behavior”, then you are in an unhealthy relationship and it’s a completely different issue.","It’s extremely hard for me to orgasm. I go into sex knowing that 99% of the time, it’s just not going to happen and I’m okay with that. I still enjoy myself and I still loveee sex. All of my previous FWBs tried so so hard to get me to cum and felt bad when nothing worked and I have to keep reminding them that if I wasn’t enjoying myself, I wouldn’t keep coming back to have sex with them.

aed5hv,"I have a feeling this post might not be very popular and I understand - almost all users of this subreddit are well-intentioned and educated. Nevertheless I wanted to bring something up. Quite often there's an assumption that you must ""reassure"" OP they can ""still be straight"" if they post about feelings of same gender attraction. I get the impulse - because of course, it can be the case that rare feelings of same gender attraction are not a reason to reevaluate your entire sexuality! However, I think it's important to also send the message that even if your sexuality is different from what you expected, THAT'S OKAY TOO.  The fact of the matter is that your body, your mind, or even your soul can surprise you with what you want. Many LGBT+ people (myself included) spend YEARS in denial of their sexuality because they keep telling themselves ""I can still be straight if ... It doesn't mean anything if ..."" and it's not healthy to be in denial of yourself. Again, I'm making this post not as a ""callout"" or in anger. I just think that it's important to balance perspectives - maybe you are straight and it was just a one off! Or, maybe, it's a chance to explore a different side of yourself. Both are okay!","YES I wish I could upvote this a million times!! And having to explain that bisexuality is a spectrum, you could be bi even if you prefer a certain gender!!

agm4l5,"For 15 years I worked in the medical field as an EMT and an LPN. I won’t say I’ve seen it all but I saw a lot more than I would have liked to see. Years ago, ass play was very taboo. With men, it was mostly reserved for homosexuals. Most heterosexuals who were into it kept it a very private part of their life...for the most part anyway.  Recently, it’s been popularized by people openly discussing the pleasure that can come with it. Which is all fine and well....whatever gets your rocks off. But people, please, be careful what you’re sticking up your ass.   I’ve seen patients and X-rays of remote controllers, screwdrivers, kids toys and produce get stuck up there. A simple google search will show you the medical ramifications of shoving the wrong things up your ass. The muscles in the area contract to keep things IN.  Remember that before you consider shoving a bottle of shampoo thru the chocolate factory. And wrapping it in a lubed up ziplock bag isn’t going to help it come back out or salvage your dandruff protection.  It’s an embarrassing process to check into the ER with “I don’t know, suddenly I started to get these terrible pains in my stomach”. And you aren’t going to be given a laxative to help pass it out (maybe some smaller items). No, it’s not as easy as that. What’s going to happen is people are going to find a secure room away from you or other patients and have grand laugh at your anal escapades. New staff will look on in amazement at this unique learning opportunity. And sometimes your x-ray will wind up on the internet for the world to see. Scrubbed of all your information first, of course.  I’m starting to see in some countries where privacy is less of a concern. Video is recorded of the removal procedure and shared online. So don’t visit Thailand or Pakistan and hope the intimate encounter you had with your television remote will stay between you and the hotel.  Anyway...just wanted to throw some caution to all you anal investigators before you end up with a costly trip to the hospital. There’s nothing wrong with pleasuring yourself, but educate yourself on the right way to do it. Or risk being the butt of a few jokes at the hospital.

ahno6m,"(Thank you for the gold) Stepping back into the dating scene this year has taught me so much about the insecurities that guys have. We hear a lot about how girls struggle with body image - and that's absolutely an issue, society is the worst - but I never realized how much guys do this, too. So I just wanted to post a quick rant on dudes' bodies. Yes I am drunk.  We fucking love them. Broad shoulders, narrow shoulders? Both good for grabbing onto. Jawline? Love that shit. The hair on the back of your neck, your sideburns, oh my god your beARD? Fuck yeah. I love your back, your thighs, the little trail of hair down your stomach. And I love your stomach! You got abs? Nice. You got a little extra fluff? Fucking excellent. Your bodies are art tbh. Big dicks, small dicks? Don't give a fuck, they're all great. And you bet your ass that I appreciate your ass too. Your biceps and forearms, that's the fuckin shit. I love the way your hands look, the shape of your nose, and your eyes are damn pretty. It's so amazing to explore someone's body and you should know that we romanticize and love your bodies as much as you do ours. Every time I'm with a guy, I have to take a moment to just admire him because he's a masterpiece. **Y'all are beautiful.** Edit: Dad bods are indeed attractive and no one can change my mind.","Oh god, I’m obsessed with my boyfriend’s forearms and shoulders. He has so many freckles everywhere and it’s just so sexy. His thighs too! They’re thick but heavenly. I think I’m just obsessed with my boyfriend tbh.",2304
ai51u9,"Just need to get a rant out. Yes, my lovely partner \[M27\] and I \[29F\] are going to talk about this, but first, some anonymous internet catharsis. Hey T, I don't think you realize this, but when you turn me down for sex, it makes me feel like you don't want me. Not just in a physical sense, but also mentally and emotionally. Because you see, to have you close, to feel your skin, that's part of the way I say I love you. When I ask you to take me to bed, I'm asking you to share a deeply intimate moment. I'm opening myself up to you and asking if you want me, naked, with all my flaws. I'm asking to share my body with yours in the most vulnerable way I can imagine, because I trust you to have all of me. Having your weight on me makes me feel safe and secure. To have you inside me and your arms around me makes me feel loved and protected, because in that moment I belong to you in a way that I don't belong to anyone else; I exist solely for you. So when you turn me down, you're not just turning down the sex itself, you're turning down all the emotions that go with it, and sometimes rejection hurts more than you realize. I get it, sometimes you're tired, or you're sick, or you just don't want sex. But when you don't, I need to know that you still want me. I want your touch and your love more than any orgasm. So before you turn me down, pull me in tightly for a hug, kiss me, and whisper in my ear that you still want me but that you're just not up for sex right now. It's okay--we can have sex another time, and you can bet I'll try to jump your bones again, but until then, rejection is a lot easier when it comes with a reminder that you love me. \-S","Speaking as the one with high libido in a failed marriage, thanks for sharing these words, you captured how it felt. I never got over how I hurt when the expectation on me was to just roll over and try to fall asleep in the same bed.

anrxgo,"I posted this in another thread and was told it should have its own post because it's a helpful tip :) Sometimes, initiating sex in a long-term relationship is tricky.  So I devised this simple method to make communication about it easier:  a scale of 1-5. &#x200B; 1 - not at all in the mood 2 - prefer no (but could be turned) 3 - neutral 4 - prefer yes (but won't be super disappointed if it doesn't happen) 5 - strongly in the mood &#x200B; So sometimes I'll just say, I'm feeling about a 4 right now, how about you?  If he says he's at 2, for example, I can decide whether I want to put in the work of warming him up, and if not, we can just go to bed.  No discussion really required unless we want one.  It works in almost all situations!  It's lightweight and easy to implement.  Hope it might help a few of you :) &#x200B; Edit:  thanks for the gold! &#x200B; Edit:   I see a lot of people saying things like, use your words!  Just ask!  It should be a simple yes/no!  The whole reason this scale came about is, sometimes it’s NOT a simple yes or no. Sometimes it’s... \- “yes I’d be up for it but I’m tired so you’d have to be on top” \- “not really but if it means a lot to you tonight, I can change that” \- “I'd love it but I know you have an early morning so I won’t be upset if you don’t ” \- etc etc This scale can communicate all of these things so easily. It's not a substitute for real conversations.  It’s simply a shortcut!  Sometimes you don't want to have a drawn-out conversation, you just want to know where your partner stands.","A slight variation of this which is offered some times in sex therapy: Get two metal rulers and attach them to your bathroom mirror. Get two different colored magnets, one for each of you.  Use the rulers/magnets as a scale. Feeling super horny that morning? Slide the magnet to the top. Not feeling it at all, slide it down.  It’s a neat visual cue for both of you that doesn’t require a question and answer. It’s especially good if one of you likes to be pursued or to feel desired. Put your magnet high and just wait for the other person to initiate eventually. It can create a sense of anticipation and excitement.  ",5116
aorvjq,"I know that seems like a drastic title but it is what it is - I had Penile Cancer last year and I had it all removed 7 months ago. I still have my testicles, they were stitched up over where my Penis used to be and to urinate my Urethra was diverted to my Perineum area. It's caused us loads of issues in our relationship of nearly 10 years, but we had a really productive chat the other night and we've agreed to try and get our sexual life back on track. The problem is, how to.  Before this we had sex 6-7 times a week, and loads of foreplay such as masturbation and Oral. We played lots of sexy games etc so we did have a great sex life.  That's completely dried up, and we haven't tried anything in probably a good month plus. And all we have tried so far is me giving her oral and masturbation which she did orgasm from and I have tried wearing a strap on a couple of times which she did enjoy but I struggled to get anything out of it (in fact, it was really uncomfortable as the strap was tight on my testicles and wasn't the same angle as my penis was so it gave me backache).  Also, I don't think I've let her look at me completely naked in months. I either wear my boxers in bed or jogging bottoms. The times when we did get intimate, I had the lights off. I hate the thought of how my body looks to her.  Do we have any hope of regaining some form of sex life? Any advice on what we can try? We have ruled out anal play on me at this stage, the thought of having my bum played with gives me so much anxiety and the thought feels quite emasculating to me.  Thanks in advance!  Edit; a lot of people are trying to convince me that I'm missing out by not trying Anal play and I should give it a go despite my preconceptions.  Imagine a young woman saying that a boyfriend of hers  keeps wanting her to have Anal or give blow jobs yet she really felt uncomfortable with it and wasn't her forte. Would you suggest she should and if she didn't, she's missing out? That's how I feel. ","I don’t think I have enough information about the strap on you’ve tried, but what I can tell you as a bisexual woman that has used one is that I can imagine “how it feels” depends wildly in the model. Think about it as when you were a teenager and tried a condom for the first time: sizes are _slightly_ different depending on the brand, right?  I would highly recommend checking out opinions from the FtM trans community, because this might help, for example. Some of them will be able to relate to you easily -the anxiety with regards to showing your new body, the nuances on the angle and how some materials rub against your skin etc. Checking with the lesbian community could help too -and your interest in keep pleasuring your partner will be highly respected. Besides phallo-centric activities, there is so much more to sex than PIV! Talking from first hand experience, I get super turned on with certain points in my body (in the back, in my skull, ribs and hips) and I am pretty much convinced I could come by rubbing my nipples (tho haven’t managed yet) The amount of pleasure I get from other peripheral sensorial stimulation is insane. Last but not least -confidence is sexy. You need to regain your body confidence! You went through cancer, you are alive and still the person she fell in love with. She fell in love with you, not with your penis. I’m not saying is gonna be a smooth road, and I bet it’ll require effort from both sides but man! You’ve gone through the worse part!  Look for help, encourage her to work as well on a way to express what she feels. For sure she will have to mourn a bit “the sex life before this” and you two should find a safe space to do that together, but you have a WILD, VAST sex life ahead of you. Really. I am 100% convinced of this.  Best of luck!  Edit: thank you kind annon for the gold! I did not expect that :)  Edit 2: oh wow, 3 Gold! Hope this helps OP to believe there’s a good sex life waiting for him -just a different one!",3345
apinoy,"My wife of 10 years is convinced I am gay following our sexual encounter Saturday night. We went out to a friends birthday party. She drank more than usual.  We got home at midnight, baby sitter left. Go up to our room, get ready. I get in bed first, I bend over the bed to grab a few pillows that fell off on her side. She comes out of the bathroom and tells me to freeze. Usually this means something important so I do. She comes over to me. Starts kissing my butt cheeks. Starts fondling my balls and penis. Licks my balls from behind, sucks on my penis a little.  From here she does something she never has done and has never been on the table. She starts licking my taint, around my anus and near it. With about 5 minutes of teasing she sticks her tongue in my anus and licks up and down, around .....all over. First off, this felt incredible and turned all my buttons.  After a long tossing I flipped over, she then grabbed lube and put her finger in my anus and started massaging what must be my prostate while blowing me. I cum hard 3 mins later.     Next day and still today she has closed off and all she talks about is how I am a gay man and we should never have been married or had kids.  Doesn't know why I hid it all along, blah blah. Not sure what to do here. Shes wrong and I only find women sexy/attractive.  Anyone have a similar experience and can help?  &nbsp;  2.12.19 We are talking more about this and she seems to think this is a hidden secret I have always had. I'm suspicious this is, as some have said, a long walk to say we need a divorce.  I'll post more when it makes sense &nbsp;  5.9.19  It looks like she wanted to see other people and I'm....ok with it. We are doing cuck play now. We have picked up a few men at bars and they come over and I get handcuffed or tied up and get to watch them go at it. When they're done I finally get my release and needs satisfied, it's like a deeper form or edging. I never thought I would be that guy but I'm sure it's just a phase for her, we still love each other more every day and our communication had gotten so much deeper.  So we are still together but things have changed!",WTF? Why would she do it then? Was she intentionally setting you up? Obviously liking your asshole played with doesn't make you gay. Same nerve endings as women that make it feel good for them. Anatomy and physical pleasure don't really have a sexual orientation.  I hope she figures this shit out. This sounds horrible.,7968
aprdai,"I'm 20, female. I'm mute and I've never been able to speak and I can't really make any vocal noises. It's an issue, but I use sign language(not that anyone I know can understand it) and can usually communicate fairly well by just typing stuff on my phone for the majority of people, though some think I'm being rude or whatever. I'm used to feeling shitty or bad over stuff like that. My current bf has been fairly okay with it and doesn't seem bothered, and he even tried learning bsl for me but he doesnt get it.  The issue I had was that in sex lately, he has taken to being more dominant and talking about stuff like how I can't say no and I'm not able to call for help and it's weird and starting to get a bit scary.  I discussed it with him the other day and he got pissed and dismissed me, so I chose not to have sex because I feel uncomfortable when he says that stuff, to which he said I was being unfair for ""withholding sex"" and I feel shit rn. Am I in the wrong here? I don't feel like I'm being unfair by not doing something where I dont feel safe. Also, any advice on how I could discuss this in a way that will help him understand? Thxx UPDATE: Thanks for all the support and advice, I've decided to end the relationship so I can be comfortable and maybe learn some more of what I want to do.",Sounds pretty creepy to me tbh.

atyz45,"I’ve been on birth control since I was 14 (which stopped my ovulation) and just got off it for the first time very recently, and I woke up a day or two ago with my underwear literally soaked through. My first thoughts were honestly that I had wet the bed. On top of that, all I can think of is sex and am constantly aroused. My every second thought is sex-related and I can barely get anything done. Also, clitoral stimulation does absolutely nothing for me and the only way I feel actually satisfied is when there’s something inside of me I know ovulation is just your body trying to get you pregnant but *holy fuck*. There’s something about it that’s so primal  I thought there was something wrong with me til I googled it and found out that all women who ovulate go through the same thing every month (though maybe on different levels of intensity).   It’s weird how this seemingly isn’t ever discussed","Yeah ovulation is crazy! I like it, it makes me feel so alive... and horny lol. Am pregnant now and I really miss ovulating!",1377
av66kx,"I have spent a lot of time recently on r/smalldickproblems. What I have noticed, is that the general public could be more mindful of the way we talk about others. We often judge, and while sometimes that is good, in other ways it can be detrimental to ourselves and others.   So, I am appealing to the broader community. Please notice, when you pass judgment on a man's masculinity. They just are as they should be, and that is ok. You don't have to be a certain way, other than the way you want to be and same as them. Please notice when you may say something that could be belittling. Please notice, __especially us females__ that when you direct your disgust or anger on a person's body part (Their dick) instead of the behavior you are actually upset at, you increase the problem, you do not remove it. Edit: This also goes for men and women- circumcision is also not a point to make fun of someone for. Cut or uncut, fine if you have a preference, but men are fine just as they are. I have had people in the very average size range worry they are not big enough. I have had people in my preferred length (4 inches or so) express they are not big enough. I have had people who want to kill themselves because they have become so isolated because they can't find a place in society.   If we want to solve issues like sexism, push agendas like feminism (i am a feminist) and encourage tolerance, we need to treat men with the same tolerance. We need to include men of every shape and size. While your preference may not be a smaller dicked guy, and that is ok, do not belittle him. He likely already feels down enough within himself. Approach his poor behaviour with kindness, and have an awareness for your own needs. It is ok to be firm, but do not be cruel if you can avoid it.  And shout out to all the dudes with small gear living the dream, and facing their fears, and kicking ass at it. :)   For all the women and men on here (and everyone inbetween), doing the best they can, thank you for your time, and I hope this resonates a little bit with you. We all need love, and to get it, we must give it as well. <3  Edit: This belongs in r/sex because these issues are debilitating to sexual relationships. It actually freezes the notion of sexual relationships. We all need sex and love, and society shouldn't stop us. Edit: I'm not crying, you are crying!. Dang estrogen...  Edit: I am not going to police comments, But I would love for this to stay a safe space for everyone to talk. Thank you, in advance.  For those that may be hurting and have something only negative to say, my hope is that the people in this positive bubble will speak to you with kindness and understanding, and you may leave here feeling less upset.  To my positive peeps, I hope you may help me out, to listen with kindness.  Edit: Single ladies, if you are brave and would like to talk to some lovely dudes that are on the smaller side, and don't mind the occasional moment of frustration, please find the female lurker post i just made in the other sub. there are some dudes that would be happy to talk to real live female humans. lol.

az336j,"So, last night I slept with my 21/m friend. I am 31/f. We go to university together and are very good friends. I know he has only been with one other person, I assumed he might be a bit inexperienced....wow, was I wrong. He picked up incredibly quickly what I liked, and was so attentive and caring that it made me cry. No one has ever been that nice to me in bed before.

b41ufr,"I’ve come across a lot of guys that seem to have the misconception that if they just pound away, pull your hair, and shove their fingers in your mouth all girls are going to melt and fall in love. It’s super super common in sexting - “baby I’m gonna destroy your ass and tear your cervix and pull your hair out.” Full stop.  Wtf dudes.   If you’re a dude that’s getting this crazy idea that ALL girls are dying to be obliterated during sex, from porn and not from signals from your real partner, please make sure to listen and pay attention! Be safe!! I gave the okay for my partner to choke and slap me and then I had to tell him DONT choke me until my face is purple and DONT slap me like you’re trying to win a fight. Sex is a dance between two people, not a one-man show with the girl used as a prop for any fantasy. My first encounter with one guy, he was so rough but I was afraid to say anything and I was whimpering and moaning all right - but more in fear/pain, and he’s back there thinking I’m such a good slut just dying for the rough stuff. Now that that’s behind me, I’ve watched a lot of porn where I hear the exact same noises from the girls - everyone should know this but PORN IS FAKE and I wouldn’t be surprised if half the hardcore videos feature girls that are either not into it or down right hate being impaled and hit. Check in with your partner from time to time, ask if she’s still doing okay. Some of the hardcore videos I watch are downright terrifying to me and I’ve had men try to recreate them without discussion thinking that I’d absolutely love it because the girls in the video are pretending to love it. What’s also terrifying though is those sexters. If I’m having a conversation with a guy and he pulls out the “spank you red, yank your hair hard, bend you backwards and choke you on this dick until you’re crying xoxo” I’m not continuing that conversation because seriously y’all are buggin if you think every girl wants to be treated that rough. Always listen, always build up *after* you’ve gotten the right signals, otherwise you’re gonna come across looking like a damn psycho. Like the last comment I read on this subreddit (it was downvoted though) said to drag a girl by her hair and make her deepthroat you when you want to cum because 9 out of 10 bitches want it rough.   If you’re one of the guys that DOESN’T act like this, or that establishes boundaries first before getting rough, thank you so much! Safe sex is so important so remember - wrap it up and tone it down, and tune in for next week’s tedtalk. ;p Edit: thanks for the silver whoever you are! Hopefully you’re not trying to make up for eggbeater fingering your girl’s pussy last night :P just kidding, you guys are being great in the comments so far and I’m glad everyone is so on board with boundaries and consent.

Thanks, you-know-who-you-are!",You said it perfectly. I have a short version: Rough sex is only good sex when it's done with the greatest possible sensitivity to your partner. It's a paradox with multiple layers.,1639
b499pu,"**First things first: everyone has different preferences and what may arouse one person may make another cry** - that's why it's important to stick to safe areas with someone you've not discussed specifics with or to ask your partner (it's often easier via text) about each of these topics and areas before dumping them on them during sex. Moreover, what may make one person aroused may make another laugh. That's OK! Sex is not something to be ashamed of. Now with that out of the way. Are you like me? I used to think that dirty talk was intimidating and not do it much because: 1. I didn't think I could remember a whole big scene or improvise one on the spot. 2. I felt like I wasn't able to 'get into character' as this dashing rogue or this seductive harlot. 3. I felt like whatever sounded sexy coming from some pornstar just sounded cheesy coming from me. But the *biggest* impediment was that *I didn't know what to say*. Well, there's an easy solution to all of these problems, and it's as easy as *starting simple*. **Lesson One:** **Understand that you don't need to remember more than a few words to successfully give your partner amazing dirty talk.** The biggest myth about getting started with dirty talk is the idea that you need to jump right into creating an elaborate roleplay where you're a police officer or a cheerleader or that you need to pretend to be someone that you're not. Or that you need to memorize any kind of script. In fact - you can get started right now by acknowledging that dirty talk can be as simple as 'don't stop', 'just like that', 'you feel so good', 'you're so hot/sexy', or if even that seems too intimidating it could be just whispering 'fuck'. The truth is that using just a few words can be just as hot or hotter than having a 200 word speech memorized. If you're thinking, I don't buy it - there's no way just saying some generic 'that feels good' or 'you're hot' bullshit is what real good dirty talk looks like, I need to be able to give something less 'generic porn star', then my friend - proceed to step 2. **Lesson Two:** **Understand that everyone likes to hear different 'ideas' in bed - although there are a few safe areas you could start.** What do I mean by this? Well - there are a bunch of categories of ideas that many examples of dirty talk draw from. If you can classify these ideas/concepts, you might find that many of the most popular fall into neat groups. The benefit to this is that if you find out what makes your partner tick and deliver something a little more personalized, it can still be just a few words but it might suddenly be the hottest sex they've ever had. Here are just some examples. Some of these are worded to be specific to the active party or passive party, might reference certain body parts, etc. but you can easily switch them up. **One last warning** - everyone is different and what is a turn-on for one person may be a turn-off for another - that's why discussing these things outside of bed can be a good idea - if its too awkward then talk about it over text. These first few are safer and probably more common. **Encouragement:** 'Fuck me', 'you can cum for me', 'I want you to cum', 'I want you to fuck me', 'I want to make you cum', 'just like that!', 'nice and slow, just like that', 'harder! just like that!', 'that feels so good', 'oh yes', 'don't stop' **Sweet:** 'you are amazing', 'I need you', 'you mean so much to me', 'I love you' **Questioning:** ""Do you want to fuck me?"", ""Do you want my cock?"", ""Does that feel good?"", ""Do you like that?"" **Describing how they feel:** ""That feels so good doesn't it?"", ""you want to fuck me so bad"", ""you're going to cum right away, aren't you?"",  **Compliments:** ""You're so big"", ""it's so deep"", ""you're so tight"", ""you're so hard for me"", ""you're so wet"" Then you have some that are more niche and specific to the desires of the individual - you may want to ask the person about them outside of the bedroom (or via text if it's less intimidating to bring up) **Impregnation:** 'Cum in me', 'Fill me up', 'I'm gonna cum in you', 'get me pregnant', 'make a baby in me', 'let it go' **Ownership:** 'I own you', 'you belong to me', 'this is my pussy', 'this is my cock', 'your _____ belongs to me' **Praise:** 'Good _____ (girl, boy, pet, etc)' or 'bad _____ ' :O, 'be a good _____ for me', 'be a good _____ and _____ for me', 'that's a good boy/girl/pet', 'that's my good _____ ', etc. **Body parts** (if you know your partner loves a certain part of you - might be good to ask them ahead of time if there's a certain part of you that drives them wild if you don't want this to backfire): ""Look at my ass"", ""you can't keep your eyes off this cock"", ""You like looking at my _____ (tits, ass, cock, chest, legs, pussy, etc)?"", ""do you like my _____ ?"", ""you want to touch my _____so bad don't you?"", **Teasing** (delivery is more important here): ""You want me, don't you?"", """"You're not gonna last, are you?"", ""is this gonna make you cum?"", ""you like that, don't you?"" **Denial** (which goes along with teasing - it's about temporarily denying something so they have to wait): So if you said ""You want me to _____ (fuck you/touch your _____ /let you cum/take off my _____ ), don't you?"", then you could follow up with: 'that's too bad', 'not yet', 'you have to wait', 'you need to earn my _____ (pussy/cock)', 'if you're a good _____ (boy/girl/) / good for me, I'll let you'. This is slightly more advanced obviously but tease and denial go hand in hand - you make them earn something, wait for something, or beg for something. Which leads to... **Begging:** 'Please fuck me', 'Please let me cum', Please let me see your _____ ', 'I want your _____ so bad', etc. Just gonna say - this one is pretty much a nuclear stimulant for many people. Just add 'please' to the beginning or end of anything else and whimper out the word while looking them in the eyes. 'Please cum in me' with a pleading look over and over is a personal fav although it may make things end prematurely. Works for any gender, don't let expectations about sexuality or gender hold you back: girl riding on top of you? Repeatedly mutter 'please don't stop' or 'please let me cum' in a breathy voice and watch what happens. This works well with tease or denial as well. You could tease your partner 'do you want to fuck me/me to fuck you?', then if they say yes, say 'beg for it'. Of course they might just stare at you in confusion, in which case you could instruct them, ""Say 'please fuck me'/'please let me fuck you'"", insist and say 'I'm waiting', and then follow up with 'good _____ (boy/girl/pet)' when they comply. Now you can start to see how some of these concepts can even link together quite well. **Titles:** Some people like to be called certain names in bed, and you may find that even though saying these names doesn't turn you on or get you off that it's hot enough seeing your partner's eye's light up or seeing their reaction that you enjoy saying these words or calling them by these names. They are incredibly individual and what may make one person aroused might make another laugh, but that's OK. Examples might be 'sir, good boy, good girl, bad boy, bad girl, daddy, slut, princess, whore, doll, toy, master, slave, mistress' - as you can see this can easily get into some BDSM-ish areas but that's OK - if using a word like this gets you excited just go for it and forget about whether it's weird or has connotations you don't want to associate with. Titles are great for adding variety to other existing dirty talk. Instead of 'fuck me' it's 'fuck me daddy' or 'fuck me slut'. Instead of 'please let me cum' it's 'please let me cum, sir' or 'please let me cum, mistress' The following are straight up risky if you haven't broached the topic and asked the person about them before hand - but they are actually often the *hottest* if a person is into them so I highly encourage you to ask your partner in a respectful way if any of them would be a turn-on!: **Degradation** (degrading acts is often described as acts that made the person feel less than or demeaned, degrading words are often described as words that feel demeaning or make one feel small or disrespected: 'you're my slut', 'I'm your whore', 'you're a fuck toy/doll', 'you're my bitch' **Humiliation** (obviously this is only for certain types of masochists - but it's more common than you think - just ask your partner what they're into! this one is extremely individual and different people prefer to be humiliated for different things, in different ways, for different traits, or with specific words. be careful): 'You're worthless', 'you're not enough for me', 'you're just a whore/slut', 'is that all you've got?', 'this is all you're good for', some people like words like 'slut/whore/fucktoy' some like getting their dick size made fun of ('you're so small, I can barely feel you, etc') it's all very individual. There's a tremendous amount of variety in this kink and you have to find out what in particular your partner enjoys and research it. **Orders** (for some people this may seem very safe but you'd be surprised by how many people simply are not OK with this - and that's perfectly valid so if you want to be safe you can discuss this first): 'Suck my _____ ', 'Get on your knees', 'Kneel for me', 'Ass in the air', 'Spread your legs', 'Show me your _____ ', 'Get your _____ out', 'Stroke your cock', 'Look at my _____ and _____ (touch yourself/stroke your cock)', 'Look at me', 'Look me in the eyes', 'Take off your _____ ', 'Stand up and undress yourself for me', 'Undress yourself and kneel', 'Undress yourself and get on your hands and knees', 'Get that cock out', 'Fuck me harder!', 'Faster Harder!' **Deserving something**: ""Do you think you deserve my cock/pussy?"", 'do you think you deserve to see my body?', 'do you deserve to cum?', 'I don't think you deserve to fuck me', 'I don't think you deserve this cock', I don't think you deserve to cum yet' This might lead to - **Earning something**: 'If you want to _____ (cum/fuck me) you're going to have to _____ me/for me', 'if you want me to touch you then you need to beg', 'if you want to fuck me then you better make me cum', 'if you want me to fuck you then you better get on your knees', if you want to cum then you better beg for it' **Punishment** 'You've been a bad ___ (girl/boy)', 'time to get spanked', 'you've been bad, maybe I shouldn't suck your cock', 'you've been bad, maybe I shouldn't rub your clit', 'you've been a naughty boy/girl, I don't think you deserve pleasure yet' **Trigger warning: non-consent, jealousy, cheating**: Extremely risky (but often appreciated by some) **Non-consent** play is something that *must* be discussed ahead of time, period. But it's also something that [is somewhat common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19085605). You could use words like 'please stop', 'no', 'don't do that', 'don't cum in me', 'it hurts', etc. Or from the other side 'you can't stop me', 'you can't help but enjoy this', 'you deserve this', etc. I don't want to go to deep into this because it may be too much for some readers, but for those who have had this fantasy, be aware that very simple dirty talk (from either party involved) can be incredibly fulfilling. You may find that you discover an entire new side to sex. **Hotwife/hothusband**: For those who aren't aware - hotwife and hothusband fantasies (and cuckold fantasies) are [some of the most common fantasies around](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolution-the-self/201602/what-secret-male-sexual-fantasy-is-surprisingly-common) and for many dirty talk is the healthiest outlet for these things, and it *doesn't* mean that either party consents to enacting them in real life outside of a fantasy. Important fact: hotwife/hothusband kink is about being turned on by one's partner having sex with someone else. That's it - no humiliation, jealousy, or anything else needs to be added on for it to be hotwife/hothusband fantasy. Cuckold and cuckquean fantasies involve other elements that are very down to the individual but often involve jealousy or humiliation that is enjoyed on the side of the cuckold/cuckquean. It's not healthy for everyone to engage in these practices if they aren't emotionally healthy, but for many who take part in them, it's the same as enjoying be whipped or flogged and getting turned on by the physical pain. But I digress! For anyone who has pre-discussed this and wants to fulfill their partner's kink, you could say things like: 'Imagine/picture me getting fucked', 'you wanna watch me fuck someone?', 'I love fucking other guys/girls', 'I fucked _____ (someone else/a guy/a girl) last night', 'I got fucked by _____ this morning'. **Cuckold/cuckquean**: These are similar to hotwife but they may involve humiliation, jealousy, comparisons, or certain kinky acts. Very simple versions of dirty talk may be 'you could never fuck me like (him/her/my ex/my _____)', 'he is so much bigger', 'watch me fuck a real man', 'she was so hot'. If your partner is into this - seriously just google it and you'll find an endless amount of ideas, but also be aware that they may like certain aspects but absolutely be crushed by others. Treat each idea as a separate checkbox that they may like or dislike. **Teasing++ / stoking competitiveness** - this can be a mix of teasing, humiliation, jealousy-play. For some who aren't into hotwife/cuckold they may still like the competitive nature of this. For others it crosses over into worst nightmare, so be careful!: 'Can you fuck me harder?', 'are you going to cum already?', 'can you keep going or will it make you cum?', 'is this the best you can do?', 'fuck me like you mean it' **End Trigger Warning**: The categories I listed above are definitely biased by my own preferences and are just a few ideas, but you can probably think of many, many more. **Lesson Three:** Ask your partner which ideas or themes appeal to them. This is pretty obvious, but you can have an open dialogue about these topics, about these ideas, find out what did it for them, what they may like to try. If you have a new partner or haven't broached it with them, you may start off by sticking to the safe topics and then ask them about others later. **Lesson Four:** Start with basics, and then add synonyms, variations, change wording, and eventually improvise with your scaffolding. This is a huge one. If you learn that your partner really likes hearing about a particular theme, you may want to eventually start building a vocab around that topic. You have to be very careful and move slowly with many of these themes though. If 'you're a slut' turns them on, see about saying 'you're my slut', 'you're such a fucking slut', 'whose slut are you?', 'you're my slut', 'are you gonna be a good slut for me?'. If slut works, then see about similar words like whore. You could replace every 'slut' in the previous section with 'whore', or try 'fucktoy'. Part of this is about creating a sense of never knowing what's coming next and maintaining unpredictability. It's important to note that people have different triggers, associations, and feelings about words that may seem very similar to you, so you may want to ask them ahead of time about each word, if they say that a word doesn't work for them - just take their word for it even if it doesn't make sense to you. If they enjoy 'cum for me', you could start adding in 'do you want to cum for me?', 'are you going to cum for me?', 'I bet you want to cum for me'. You can cross into new areas or find new kinks by linking existing ones. So if you know they like 'cum for me', you can help them build a new kink or discover they have a different kink by crossing from 'cum for me' to 'be a good boy/girl/pet and cum for me' and they may end up eventually creating a new arousal trigger for those new words as well. Maybe you start saying 'I wonder if I can make you cum for me in 30 seconds'. If someone likes hearing how great their cock is, you want to try to build new phrases that mean the same thing in over time. You start off with 'you're so big', but slowly add 'your cock is so thick', 'your cock is so deep', 'it's stretching me', 'you're stretching me', 'you're so fucking big', 'I can barely take you', etc. Finally, if you have a scaffolding in place and some of this stuff starts to feel stale or like you could do it in your sleep, then you might start building stories, roleplays, etc. around them. If 'cum for me' is too easy, start going for 'You're going to get undressed when we get home, you're going to get your favorite toy out, I'm going to use it on you and you're going to cum for me'. **Lesson Five:** You may not truly believe that two words alone or three words alone can be all you need to unleash a flood of arousal within your partner. Going further, you may not believe it, but sometimes repeating the simplest thing over and over is the hottest thing ever. You might imagine saying 'I own you' or 'cum in me' or  'you don't deserve me' or  'that's right, suck my cock' over and over again sounds like it would just get stale or boring or weird. You might think you need to not repeat yourself. But if you find something that triggers arousal in your partner, repeating it over and over again to them during sex might actually be the hottest thing ever to them. In fact, here's a demonstration: Do you like girls? Listen to one of these and tell me that a few words isn't enough for the best dirty talk you've ever heard: ['I'm a good girl'](https://soundgasm.net/u/astra_night/Im-a-good-girl) ['Cum inside me'](https://soundgasm.net/u/4_my_eyes_only/F4M-3-Word-Challege-Cum-Inside-Me) Do you like guys? Listen to this and try to convince yourself a few words won't do the job. ['My good girl'](https://soundgasm.net/u/Endless_Roads/M4F-My-Good-Girl-Three-word-Challenge) ['Take it'](https://soundgasm.net/u/princeofroses/Take-It) Apologies for heteronormativity/gender binary-tivitywhateverthefuckyouwouldsay but just search GWA. Now, understand that you can do this too! If you enjoyed hearing someone else just use a few words over and over then it makes sense that someone might like to hear you say something they find sexy over and over. If you want more inspiration, I do recommend searching /r/gonewildaudio for 'word challenge' to see more examples. **Lesson Six:** If you have confidence in dirty talk but your partner does not, feels self-conscious about it, or feels flustered if you use dirty talk that requires a response from them or asks them a question, then you may want to stick to statements not questions. Instead of 'do you like it when I _____ ?' you might start with something that doesn't need a response like 'you feel so good'. **Lesson Seven:** Are you nervous to start? Don't know what to begin with? This is just me, but I think the easiest thing to do is to try something that's only 2 or 3 words, and say it during any sex act where you are both being pleasured at the same time - intercourse or 69 would be my personal recommendation. You might stumble over your words, forget what you wanted to say, or feel embarrassed about your delivery if you say something that's multi-part or complex, but a simple 'don't stop' or 'you're so tight/wet/hard/big' is short enough that you will feel less pressure and basic enough that very few people would throw you out of bed, think you're trying too hard, or think it's weird. The reason I would recommend starting off with it during intercourse or 69 is that for whatever reason it can feel like a lot of pressure on the speaker or feel self-conscious if you try to be vocally performative during manual or oral sex. Whereas if you are both feeling pleasure in the moment, any awkwardness will be more likely to not be noticed due to the feelings of pleasure and you're more likely to feel uninhibited. **What are some of the categories of dirty talk that you find super hot or super effective?** Edit: Didn't know how much this would get seen or not, but since it's getting seen a lot - I will add that some of this edges into kink and BDSM and so it may be a good idea to be familiar with the idea of aftercare - which essentially just means that it's possible emotions can run high during an encounter when you use charged language or intense acts so you should be prepared to give your partner special treatment afterwards if they need it.  This can be things like reassuring them they are important, are valuable, or that you care about them. It could be telling them that what you said during the encounter isn't true or is the opposite of how you feel. It could be just cuddling. As with all things it's individual and is something to be discussed with open communication and should be subject to change and evolution.","While we don't solicit or encourage long essay-type posts here in r/sex, I've made an exception for this one after some private discussions with u/kinkyghost.

b57bkz," this is totally my opinion    you can fuck anybody ... but when you guys are in love with each other in every way possible , it’s different . you guys are making love , deeply and lovingly looking into each other’s eyes as the strokes push deep and slow , moaning into each other’s mouths as you passionately tongue kiss , devouring each other eagerly .... your heart is racing not because of the act itself but because you get to share such a beautiful experience with your one true person . the smiles you guys exchange , your fingers interlocking , kissing every inch of each other’s faces .  and when you guys orgasm TOGETHER , you’re overwhelmed with utter love .  sorry i just miss my boyfriend . ","Last night my boyfriend of three years held me in his arms and we had the most amazing, loving sex I've ever had.  I could feel every inch of him as he slowly moved inside me.  He kept pausing to let my muscles clench because it was so intense that I couldn't help myself.   When I got close to orgasm he wrapped his whole body around me and started whispering in my ear how much he loved me and wanted to feel me let go.

b6dcn9,"I never say no to sex, or to giving head, not because I'm in an abusive relationship or anything, but because im just as horny, if not more, than my bf, so I'm more than happy to get it on. So earlier today, i was Not Feeling It. I woke up with a pounding headache and my nose clogged up. I was in a bad mood all day and all i wanted was to sleep when i got home. But my bf surprised me by picking me up from work and buying me lunch. We decided to stop by an adult store to buy some lube and see if anything else there tickled our fancy. We ended up buying a new vibe for me. We got to his place and sure enough he starts to get handsy. We make out for a while but i just can't get into it. So i push away slightly and tell him I'm not really in the mood and would rather take a nap. He smiles and kisses me lightly and tells me not to worry. He tucks me into bed and i fell asleep almost instantly. Its probably not a big deal to anyone else, but to me it meant so much. He didn't pout, didn't get upset, didnt even ask why (although it was probably pretty obvious with my stuffed up nose). Its those small things that really make me fall in love with him and make me want to choke on his dick. Edit: i've been reading nearly all the comments and the ones that stand out the most are thise that are saying how ssad it is to praise men for doing the bare minimum, and i understand why this is upsetting. Its behavior that should be expected, like being a big boy and understanding and not being a dick about a simple 'no'. To me, its a big deal because previous partners have not been so kind. Both male and female. I've had a female partner (fwb) who would leave if i declined sex and go fuck someone else. I've had male fwb who would spam with with texts annoying thr hell out of me. So let me make this clear, to me this is big, i have someone who is mature and i sure as hell will celebrate it. And, this is not a strictly heterosexual thing and to think so is really narrow minded. Also thanks for silver!  Edit 2: can yall cut it with the ""tHe BaR hAs BeEn SeT sO lOw On MeN"" comments?

I was with a partner the other day and we were trying some new toys and while we did have tons of fun in the beginning, towards the end (it was a long session, like 1h+), we were both really exhausted physically and mentally, plus starving because we hadn't eaten.  The exhaustion paired up with experimenting with a brand new toy I didn't know how to use yet meant that by the end, we kinda just gave up and neither one of us orgasmed.  It made me feel pretty shitty honestly until I convinced myself that just because we didn't get off didn't mean it was bad.

b8ww7y,"This is something that isn’t really addressed or acknowledged, but I don’t think it’s fair. Men are expected to hold an erection, cum at a certain time, have a big piece. I mean, yes, women do have pressures on them too but the pressures on men are rarely acknowledged. And these are things they can’t really control, I mean sometimes you cum a little earlier than usual, and sometimes you lose your erection, and some of you may not have an eggplant sized piece but these things don’t make you any less lovable.  You may have already met someone, and if not, you will meet someone who will fall in love with you, who will click with you and will find it sexy when you cum regardless of when, because they’ll love you and love seeing you in pleasure. If you lose your erection, well, you don’t need to be in your head, your SO will enjoy just kissing and cuddling you just as much, even if your friend doesn’t want to cooperate.  It’s not just about the sex, it’s also about the intimacy, if I’m undressing myself with you and being in a state I wouldn’t put myself in with anyone else, I’m enjoying all of it, all of you, no matter what. I have no unrealistic expectations and I’m fully aware you’re human and not a sex robot. My body has its moments where it’s not cooperating either, sometimes I’m in my head, sometimes I hide certain body parts that I’m insecure about and that can affect my performance, but I don’t think I’ve ever felt nearly as much pressure as I would if I were a man.  Men, stop being so hard on yourselves, it’s okay to be human and your body will not cooperate every time. Us women, we love you, and if some of us women are mean about it, then you should walk away and find a more rational person to have sex with.

b9h4b8,"**Disclaimer** I am going to start off by saying that this is not the only way to have a successful threesome. By no means are these rules universal, but this is the way we did it and it went really well! **Background** My fiancee (let's call her Jenny) and I are two white-collar workers in a major metropolitan city. We have been together for over 10 years and we are both of each other's first everything (kiss, sex, romantic partners etc.). We have always been monogamous to each other and have had a fantastic relationship over the years. Despite never having any other sexual partners, we have a pretty adventurous sex life (sub-dom, light bdsm, posting sexual content etc.). I identify as straight and Jenny identifies as straight, but a little bi-curious. Jenny likes watching lesbian and threesome porn and has made out with a few girls at the bar (she's actually kissed more girls than I have lol). **How did this begin?** I always knew that Jenny was somewhat interested in girls due to her porn habits and history of being barsexual. But I always assumed it was more of a fantasy than reality. One night while we were both drunk watching threesome porn, I asked ""Would you ever actually consider having a threesome?"" To my surprise she said yes! The next question was where do we start? **Why with an escort?** We came up with a list of ways in each we could have a threesome. Some of the options included with an open-minded friend, posting online for a third party, and a swingers club. We felt that the friend option had the potential to get emotionally messy. Posting online seemed like a long-shot as we discovered that finding a girl to join a couple is extremely rare (they're called unicorns in the swinger community for a reason). And a swingers club seemed too intimidating and not discrete enough for our liking. We then decided on having a threesome with an escort. The benefits of having it with an escort were many. They are a professional who would know how to do it right. There would be no emotional attachment as they would only be there temporarily. It would be discrete and privacy is their concern as well. And we could choose a girl in advance that we both liked. **Discussion** Most importantly, we discussed our options and the threesome itself at extreme lengths. Between the first time it was brought up and the date we actually did it was about 9 months. It was very important that we didn't rush it and had time to change our minds if we wanted to. I didn't pressure Jenny to do it and usually waited for Jenny to bring it up to me to discuss. I let Jenny discuss and decide things at her own pace. It was Jenny who came to me saying she wanted to pull the trigger about 2 weeks before we actually did it. And we discussed EVERYTHING. We talked about restrictions (was I ok to kiss the escort, would Jenny go down on her, where could I cum, etc.). There is no such thing as discussing it too much. We talked about how we wanted the night to go (where would it be, how long should we book, how long would we chat with the escort beforehand etc.). We talked about if things didn't go well (what if the escort was drugged up, what if I came too early, what is our codeword if we need to back out). One of the most important things that was said was that at any point either of us could back out even if we were in the middle of things and it would be no problem. Ultimately we decided to have pretty few restrictions other than standard restrictions we have in our own personal life. We were both free to kiss her, Jenny would go down on her, and I could cum where I wanted. We had codewords in case things weren't going well or if we changed our mind. Once we felt like we had discussed everything, we needed to find the escort. **Finding an escort** I had no idea where to start looking for an escort. Through some google research I found out about review boards for escorts. On the whole, I did not like these review boards very much. Many of the commenters are pretty gross and disrespectful. However, through these review boards I was able to determine a list of escort agencies that seemed reputable. I found one in particular that seemed a bit more upscale and started searching there. With regards to legality, prostitution is still illegal in my country, but is not frequently enforced. The agency I found seems to have been in business for many years so legal issues did not concern us significantly. Once we decided on an agency, we looked through all the girls. Funnily enough, both Jenny and I have similar taste in women. We found one girl that we both liked (close in age, similar body type to Jenny). Through reading reviews I found that this particular escort (let's call her Rosa), was said to be particularly good with couples and other women. This was very important to us as we both wanted someone who would be just as comfortable with women as men. We reached out to her and she was available for the time we requested. We decided on a 1.5 hour session. **Preparation** We decided that doing the threesome at home would be a little bizarre and we didn't feel comfortable yet going to the agency's in-call location, so we decided on booking a hotel. We found a hotel that was said to be good for seeing escorts. A bit upscale, large busy lobby, no key-cards needed to take the elevators. We requested a room as far from the elevators as possible. We made a whole event of the evening. We got dressed up, went for a fancy dinner and then returned to the hotel. We brought a few things with us: high quality lube, an unopened box of condoms, unopened bottles of wine, baby wipes, mouth wash, water bottles, and good tissues. Jenny wore fancy lingerie under her dress. Even in the hours leading up to the threesome we continued to discuss that we still wanted to go through with it and we were both still cool. We both took showers shortly before Rosa arrived. **She Arrives** Rosa arrived right on time and we were both pleasantly surprised how attractive she was (since we couldn't see her face in any of her pictures). I gave Rosa her fee ($500). We opened the bottle of wine in front of her and all had a drink. No matter how much planning and discussions you do, the single most important factor for success is the escort herself. No matter how well prepared you are, if she shows up wasted or has an unpleasant attitude, it will likely not be a good time. This is why it is important to read some reviews beforehand. But Rosa could not have been more perfect for this. She was polite, social, fun and just generally a very pleasant person to be around. Most importantly, Rosa put Jenny at ease. She focused most of her questions directly at Jenny. Rosa asked Jenny if she had restrictions, if she was ok with Rosa kissing me, if Jenny was ok with Rosa going down on her etc. She told her that we could stop anytime and would only go as fast as Jenny felt comfortable. We also asked what Rosa's restrictions were and my restrictions (only one, getting my balls sucked lol). After about 30 minutes of getting to know one another Rosa suggested we move to the bed (I suggest that you use a king-size bed). **Main Event** Despite all the research and planning we did, this was the only area where we didn't plan much. Since we had no idea how it would go down, our approach was to roll with it. Rosa suggested Jenny take off her dress which she did and Rosa joined her. Rosa asked if she could kiss Jenny and she said yes. They started making out and I just sat there while I permanently engraved this memory in my spank bank. I then started kissing Jenny. Rosa then asked if it was ok if she kissed me. Weirdly enough, this part was probably the most stressful as I didn't know how Jenny would react. But Jenny was cool with it! Jenny would say after that I looked like I was kissing for the first time because my lips were kinda tight. Rosa asked if she could take off Jenny's lingerie and she said yes. I also got naked in that time. Rosa asked if she could go down on Jenny and took her time to slowly kiss down. Meanwhile I started making out with Jenny and kissing her boobs. My focus was to make sure Jenny was the center of attention. After some time, Rosa asked us both if she could suck my dick. Jenny was cool with it and they both started giving me a blowjob which was incredible to say the least. After I was hard, I wanted to fuck Jenny so I asked Rosa if I could have sex with Jenny without a condom, but to use one with Rosa. She was cool with it and off we went. I won't bore everyone with all the details (maybe I could make a [r/gonewildstories](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories) post if there was interest), but lots of positions were tried out. We kept it real casual and were joking and occasionally high-fiving. My only regret is that I was a bit nervous so I had drank a decent amount beforehand. As a result, my dick went soft a couple times which was the most painful torture since I was getting to watch 2 hot girls fuck each other. After about 45 minutes, they made out and played with each other's clits and I unloaded on both their tits. We cleaned up, chatted a bit more, then Rosa took a shower and headed out. We had planned to giver her a tip, but were so drained that we forgot (we're planning on seeing her again and giving her a double tip). **Post-Main Event** After Rosa left, Jenny and I talked for about 2 hours. We both had lots of fun and discussed our favorite parts, what we liked about Rosa, and some things we didn't expect. I made sure that Jenny still was cool with the whole event and she said she would definitely do it again in the future. After that Jenny and I fucked again and then again once more and then again in the morning and then again when we got home. It's been about a week since the threesome and Jenny and I both still talk about it. Overall, 20/10 would bang again. I'm sure I'm missing lots of details, but that should give you an idea on how it went. **TL;DR aka Final Tips** · Take as long as you need to prepare (maybe several months). · Discuss, discuss, discuss. Discuss every possible issue. · Make sure you agree on restrictions. · Come up with codewords if you change your mind mid-session. · Look up escort reviews and find one who is well-received by other couples. · Once the escort is there, don't rush things and make sure to discuss any restrictions anyone has. · Don't drink too much beforehand. · Most importantly, have fun! &#x200B; **\*\*Update\*\*** Hey just wanted to thank everyone (especially the mods) for all the positive comments! We loved reading them! I thought I would answer a few of the common questions below: *Where did you find the review boards/what website did you use?* I don't want to link any websites as I'm guessing that's against the rules. Additionally, the website we used is directly connected to the city we live in. But if you google escort review boards and your city, you should be able to find something. *Why use an agency over an independent escort?* We didn't have any strong feelings about this other than the fact that using an agency seemed a bit more reliable, especially since this was our first time. But it's definitely something we would consider in the future. *How did you convince Jenny to do this?* The conversation went like this: Me: Hey would you want to have a threesome. Jenny: Sure. I didn't convince her. She decided on her own that she wanted to do this. I would never try and convince her if she said wasn't down for it. If I asked and she said no that would have been the end of it. Even though we agreed to it in principle, we didn't fully agree until we had worked out all the details and discussed everything. *How did you guys deal with jealousy?* As I said, we have been totally monogamous for over 10 years. Neither of us are jealous people. Our level of commitment is so strong that we felt confident that we could do something like this and not get jealous. We also discussed jealousy and anything that could make each other jealous. We took things slow to make sure everyone was comfortable as things progressed. And we have had lots of discussions since. *How did Jenny feel about you fucking Rosa?* I asked Jenny today. She said thought it was hot. We have a mild dom/sub relationship so she thought it was really dominant of me. She said she felt like, ""Damn right that's my man."" She said it was like watching a porno featuring me lol. *Did we have to supply proof of being STD free?* No. I would have done so if asked, but she never asked. *Why not try swinging?* Neither of us are against it, but since this was our first foray into group sex we thought that this way would be the simplest. *Why not a MFM threesome?* I'm indifferent towards this and Jenny said she's not interested. *Has there been any fallout since it happened?* Nope! In fact if anything I think we have been having more sex than average. We've talked about it almost every day this week. We're both still cool with it and are going to try and set up another session in the future. *Where's the* r/gonewildstories *post?* Here you go!

ba31an,"As the title says, my bf sent me a sexy photo of himself and I was completely distracted by how perfect his hand was, it’s like the perfect man hand and it instantly made me horny. His penis is aesthetically as lovely as a penis could be, but his hand... damn.  So guys if you’re insecure about sending a nude, if you’ve got any physical assets beside your penis that you can throw in the frame it may just be a bonus! ","Yep. My SO and I share the odd scant picture. I was cleaning, passed behind her, and saw her zooming in on one of the pictures. Penis? Nah, she was full-screened on my clavicles.

bahncd,"I am so sick and tired of seeing people on this subreddit pressure others to do kinky/fetish stuff without the OP ever showing any interest in doing it.  I appreciate that this sub tends to have an open mind about sex and offers valuable advice to people, but there is also a lot of people who seem to want to take any chance to gush about their own kinks and fetishes and tell others to do things that are outlandishly inappropriate for what the OP is asking about.  Specific recent thing I've seen: ""I'm uncomfortable with my boyfriend masturbating to pictures of my sister, it feels violating to her and I don't think I can look at him the same."" Reply: ""Dress up as your sister and wear her clothes and let your boyfriend fuck you and pretend you're her.""  and then the replies are full of people being like ""yeah, dress up as your sister!"" ignoring entirely whether or not OP has shown any interest in that (and it's pretty clear she isn't into it.)  I constantly see people peddling their kinks and fetishes to others on here even when it is not relevant and I am baffled by how so many others think that's okay and respectful. The answer to sex issues is not going to always be ""have wild orgies while being tied up and pegged and double fisted"" yet there's so many users who seem to use this subreddit as a place to encourage others to try their kinks/fetishes.   It honestly just feels like some users want to get off on certain things and think ""it turns me on so I want to tell everyone to do it even if it's nowhere near the solution this person needs.""   So what I'm asking is can we report users who do these sorts of things? It's not particularly against any of the current rules but it is extremely uncomfortable to see happening so often and I honestly think there's some people on here who just want to get others to act out their fantasies and use this subreddit to try and make that happen (and don't actually care about the comfort and needs of others.)  I hate that such a sex-positive community is being tainted by so many people who have a clear lack of boundaries or empathy for others. It's getting to a point where I want to steer clear of this sub entirely because these kinds of comments keep cropping up and there's such a positive reaction to them. I thought we are supposed to be respecting others' boundaries and limits and interests, not peddling our own fetishes to others no matter the situation?   Anyways rant over. I'm just unbelievably frustrated at the direction this sub is going.","there was a guy here who didn't like to be pegged because of traumatic events and his gf's kept trying to  comment section had comments saying, ""Oh just let her ease you into it, my wife does it to me and i cum instantly!"" like wtf they said no and they honestly don't even need a reason why they dont want to do it",2076

bi822e,"I see a few posts on here every month about worries involving not being good enough in the bedroom and I thought I should share my perspective. If this only helps one out every hundred people that see this, then I think this is worth posting. I'm a woman in my early 30s who has had a fair amount of sexual partners. I'm currently married to a man that I have been with for the last 7 years. i would consider myself pretty experienced in sex. I've had bad sex, meh sex, and amazing sex with men of varying levels of experience. &#x200B; I know sex is pretty daunting when you don't have much, or any, experience. In fact, sex with anyone new can be full of anxiety. You worry about how you will perform, how your partner will think of you naked, whether they will regret it or not, etc. I admire anyone who can go into sex with someone new, even if they are experienced, without any feelings of anxiety, however I don't think that's the norm. &#x200B; You WILL have bad sex, and you will be bad in bed. That's a given and applies to both men and women. And guess what: you will have bad sex with one night stands, FWBs, AND long term significant others. I love sex with my husband and I try to have it as much as I can. But sometimes, it's just bad. Maybe one of us had too many glasses of wine, we're tired, he cums quickly or not all, I can't get into it because I have a lot on my mind, or any other number of reasons. Sometimes, my husband and I will be having sex, and we'll both look at each other and we both know that it's better to just stop and cuddle up and watch a movie. &#x200B; Shit happens. &#x200B; Sex and arousal can often be very fickle. You my try your best to have amazing sex and please your partner, and it just won't happen. Therein lies the key though: trying to please your partner. I've had a great many hookups when I was younger, and I can tell you that I never looked down on a guy who didn't leave me fulfilled but tried anyway. As I got more and more sexual experience, I realized that the people who want you to have a good time and listen to what you want are the ones you want to keep around, even if they aren't able to do so immediately. My second serious relationship, which started when I was in my mid 20s, was with a guy who was a complete virgin, hadn't ever kissed anyone but me. Thankfully he told me, and when it came time to have sex, it wasn't great. However, he tried and he listened. When he tried to have sex after only a minute or two of foreplay, I told him to slow down and he did. When he went down on me, I told him what I like and he tried to do just that and went down on me for maybe 15 minutes. I didn't get off from oral or PiV that night, but I left happy knowing that he tried and listened. A short while after that, we were having amazing sex, as amazing as it would be if he had been experienced too. &#x200B; I can't speak for everyone and I'm sure there are some people out there who ditch potential partners after bad first sex, but frankly I think that's just a bullet dodged. YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE and you deserve a partner who knows this and wants you anyway. To be clear, I'm not saying there is anything wrong in not wanting to have sex with someone who is a virgin/inexperienced, just that everyone deserves to have a fulfilling romantic and sexual relationship, and if a man or woman does not want to be with you because of said virginity/inexperience, you are better off anyway. &#x200B; Sorry for the long wall of text. I always see posts relating to this and I have a close friend who is dealing with something similar, so I thought I'd share my perspective.","Yes, this!! And also no matter how experienced you are, when you meet a new partner you start from scratch again. What worked for another person may not work for this new partner. Talking, listening, experimenting and learning together are all part of great sex. And it’s so much fun to get to know someone sexually!",675
bmg7a2,"So, I've been with this girl for a little while. We have great fun sex and recently she told me she had a rape fantasy. I'm not super into it but she is and of course I want to make her happy. So, we set up a fantasy ""rape"" scenario. I made it pretty clear that we obviously need a safe word, our safe word was ""Missouri"" So, I do the whole rapist thing, pretend to stalk her and all that and she is totally into it. Then I proceed to touch her and act like I am going to rape her, then she shouts out ""Missouri""! Then of course I am totally hands off and let her know I'm not going to touch her. My hands are up in the air, so she knows. Then she'll look back at me and roll her eyes. She usually tells me that I need to keep going and the word doesn't matter. Her fantasy involves the safe word not working. I am sooooooooo not comfortable with that. I get her fantasy but I won't actually rape her. I know what you're thinking, talk to her about it, I have and she won't give me a clear answer. I recommended a double safe word but she won't go for it. How do I deal with this guys? # Edit: OP's girlfriend here. So, this seems to have gotten a fair amount of responses to it. To be honest, I really didn't know this was bothering him so much but we have since had long discussions and are coming to a compromise. He showed me this thread and the amount of people commenting with their thoughts once it blew up. I'll admit I wasn't thrilled that he turned to a bunch of strangers on the internet but I understand he only did it because he cares. This whole thing is really my fault, I am not and have never been the easiest person to communicate with. Hence why he turned to reddit, again, kind of my fault. To break down this whole thing, I was pretty violently raped when I was fourteen years old and in the process I ended up having what I believe was my first orgasm. Yes, climax during rape does indeed happen, it is rare and there is not a lot of studies that explore it but at least in my case it happened and it obviously screwed me up mentally. I do have PTSD and I have been to many therapists and quite honestly have found ways to deal with it and really be okay with myself. I have since had a few (not that many) sexual partners and had some success in getting close with them. However, I never really had a long term or meaningful relationship until now. My current boyfriend the OP have been together for about three years, which I know doesn't seem like a long time to a lot of people but to both me and him, it is very significant. We have had a good sex life, I happily indulge in a lot of his kinks that I also enjoy and won't go into. I recently told him about my ""rape fantasy"" and how I wanted to be held down and get banged against my will. I really wanted to try and recapture, for lack of a better word, ""The Magic"" of when I was raped when I was younger and had my first orgasm. This obviously involved him taking me by force and me screaming ""No"" and ""Stop"" many times as I did in the real situation. We did agree on the safe word and I did indeed use it a few times and when I did he would immediately stop, because of course that is the point of the safe word. Where I royally screwed up was not telling him about the rape that happened to me IRL. It is something that I try not to bring up because I hate the idea of it defining me but I also can't forget it happened. If that makes any sense, I know it doesn't As he always says ""Now, I know what you're thinking"" The whole double safe word thing seems like it would make perfect sense. Right? Well, to any reasonable person, yes, it would. However, I am so far from a reasonable person. The fact that I say the word and just keeps going really turns me on and to be completely honest, the idea of saying a second safe word turns me on even more, it really gives me that feeling of being taken advantage of and gets me ever close to that first explosive orgasm I had. It is utterly ridiculous and it is much more of a problem with me than it is him. I know when I am enjoying it and will always know but he really can't know. I understand that now and I feel like an idiot for not getting it before, I now (finally) understand why he would be uncomfortable with this type of roleplay. He is not a guy who would ever do something like that, he is too sweet and caring to ever come close to the guy that raped me as a kid. (I know I'm metaphorically sucking his dick but he is my boyfriend) He's the first guy I ever felt comfortable exploring this kink with and if he is not into, I won't push. We'll just put a pin in it for now and maybe explore it later when we concrete our relationship. Or we'll never come back to it again, that's cool too. I also want to make it clear that I would never use this as a weapon against him. I am appalled at the idea that women use fake rape allegations against men to ruin their life. I care for this guy too much to do that. Some people say I'm not right in the head, that is true but not for the reasons you're thinking. Anyway, thanks for listening, me and BF will prolly be OK.",Do what you're doing   That's the right call Safe words are there for many reasons    It doesn't sound like your girlfriend has the emotional maturity to participate in this sort of scenario between consenting adults.,3894
bmuiu9,"hey guys.  so i had been seeing this guy exclusively for maybe about three months? we were (or i was) definitely starting to develop serious feelings. i have slept with 5 guys (including him), and only seriously dated one. i am quite careful about relationships in general, but after getting to know this guy, I was feeling confident. he seemed kind, smart, considerate and all the other things that are important to me.   anyway the other day we made love (i love that phrase idc what anyone says) and in the middle of it, he asked me to put my bra back on. i was in Sex Mode so i just figured it was a kink he hadn’t told me about, so i popped it back on and went right back to it. later i thought it would be a good chance to learn more about what makes him tick, so i asked him about it (i am a very sexually open person & very enthusiastic about trying new things) and...well...he basically said my breasts were so unattractive he found it difficult to cum if he could see them during sex.  oh dear. well i would love to say that i coolly  stormed off and left him with some funny/stunningly clever comeback, but i did not. i cried for a bit and we came to the conclusion that we shouldn’t be together if he wasn’t attracted to my naked body as it was. maybe some couples would have tried to fix the issue, but to be honest he was quite nasty about it, and I knew i wouldn’t be able to sleep with him again and feel comfortable.  i have always been confident about my appearance, both in and out of the bedroom. i’m slim and toned, love to have the lights on and have never been shy about getting my kit off. i never loved my boobs- they’re small, a bit saggy and have quite big areola with a lot of stretch marks to boot- but i certainly never hated them or let them stop me sexually. other men never seemed to have a problem, and my ex had never voiced his thoughts either.   well i am heartbroken obviously. and very embarrassed. all women worry about living up to an impossible standard in the bedroom (men do too of course) and i think it’s a secret unspoken fear for many that a man will take our clothes off and bail. for a lot of people, boobs = sex (which is silly considering they’re just biologically fatty milk factories for babies) and i feel very unsexy right now. i think it will be a while before i have sex again.  so this is just a little reminder for everyone that sex is fun and dirty and hot, but letting someone see you naked and cumming and letting them inside your body is a really intimate and vulnerable thing. especially to people/guys my age, who can sometimes be a little self absorbed- please be kind to the person you’re sleeping with. it doesn’t matter whether it’s a one night stand, a fuckbuddy, a girlfriend or your damn wife: they are trusting you. if you really have a problem that needs to be addressed, try to phrase it gently. if it’s not constructive or helpful advice- maybe just don’t say anything? and if you have to break up with a girl because her tits are ugly, please just lie and tell her something else!   x EDIT ooft! i did not expect my little rant to get this much attention! i will try to reply where it's appropriate but just so everyone knows: 1. this conversation was not during sex, but right after, and i was still naked in his bed so not the best place! 2. i completely understand that nobody is obligated to be in a relationship with somebody they are not attracted to. i have no problem with this. i DO have a problem with the nasty way he phrased it, literally saying ""ugly tits"" to me  3. we had had a lot of sex before this and while he did seem more fond of doggy and didn't pay that much attention to my chest, it never crossed my mind that he was turned off 4. as far as lying, i really think ymmv. i just know personally that i would never tell a guy 'your dick is too small for me to cum'. i don't see why it's a good thing to ruin someone's confidence over an issue that is impossible to fix without surgery. 5. hehe no i am not posting my weird titties. y'all will have to imagine them! EDIT 2 thank you everyone for your kind words. i will be going to bed now but i am loving the boob support in this post! y'all have big titty energy <3","Just for the sake of completeness, let me post here the FAQ section on [Body Type](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index#wiki_overall_body).

bp7mq9,"This will be explicit but I'm trying to walk a line between ""clinical"" terminology and sex-positive here, so I'll jump on in. I'm a happily married man. The other night my wife wanted to pamper me. She said she wanted to give me a bath. This sounded very nice and I happily accepted. I get in the tub and she starts by giving me a nice scalp massage while washing my hair. She washes my arms and chest, etc, and it was nice and sensual and erotic and I got hard. She got some more soap and washed my balls and gave my penis a few strokes, washing and playing a bit at the same time. No problems at all. She, being a diligent and caring woman, moved on and washed my legs. She helped me rinse off with our shower head and towel dried me. After she moved on from rubbing my erection, however, I had since slowly returned to a non erect state. At this point I figured I wouldn't need clothes in the immediate future, but instead of her approaching me and getting physically affectionate, she asks if I wanted anything sweet for dessert. This wasn't a sexual thing; it's not that we don't say sweet things that way sometimes, but she legitimately has a sweet tooth and we often make runs to a local store to pick up a small pint of ice cream or get some candy. I was slightly disappointed but it's not a big deal, we have an active sex life. We're both past our 20s and have been a couple for ten years and we still have sex multiple times a week. We go to the store and come back, and then eventually sex conversation comes up. All told, I was slightly (only slightly) disappointed we didn't have sex after the pampering bath, but *she* thought that because I had an erection and then it went away that I was no longer in the mood. So it turns out that she simply interpreted my erection as sexual excitement (accurately) and my loss of the erection as a complete loss of sexual desire; Ladies: this isn't always the case! The sensual bath was wonderful and sexy, and I was definitely ready to get it up again, but erections are physically demanding to maintain, even when you're young and in shape. Yes, teenagers and really young men sometimes have lots of trouble getting their erections to go away without having an orgasm, but sitting in a warm bath and having my legs and feet rubbed was also relaxing and not immediately stimulating and so my body simply said ""alright, that's cool, I'll wait on standby,"" but again, that's a different state from completely losing the mood. I was relaxed and happy and comfortable and naked and just had my wife's hands all over my body - I was ready to get going, but I also was kind of in a passive, receiving mindset so I didn't make an aggressive move.  So, ladies, don't always assume an erection is the exclusive, binary indicator of sexual desire or arousal. As any sexually mature person should know, sexuality is nuanced and complicated and we have many different gears. Sometimes we are super horny, sometimes we *want to* get going but need some foreplay and kissing, sometimes we aren't yet in the mood but could totally come around with a request of some kind, and sometimes we just aren't in the mood, just like anybody else. So communicate with your partners! Be patient, ask questions, and show care for your partners and you should be able to manage great, healthy sex! I hope this is insightful for some people. After our nice talk we definitely banged it out, in case anyone wanted to know.  TL;DR My wife made assumptions about my sexual mood based exclusively on whether my penis was erect or not. This led to some insightful conversation and was a learning experience for us both.","I actually needed to see this, I was being all flirty with my boyfriend the other night and I got a little worried/ self conscious because he lost his erection from one side of the house to other. We still had sex but I guess I thought maybe he wasn't really in the mood. As ladies we don't really get that insight so thank you!",2151
bs8ihu,"Hi all.  Basically, I had my penis removed last year because of cancer. For content, you can read my post history.  I feel like I need to ""pay it forward"" to you all because a post I made on here gave me some amazing sound advice and has transformed my sex life, and I'd like to help those out going through the same.  First and foremost, just because you are not using a penis doesn't mean you can't have sex.  I mean, most would go ""no shit Sherlock"" but this was the biggest thing I feared before my surgery that I would never have sex again. In the last year, I've discovered this isn't the case - yes, I can't have natural penetrative sex (I'm not counting using a strap on) but now I define sex as so much more. We have oral sex, use our fingers, stimulate our nipples, even have kissing sessions and I count it as racy sex sessions. And when we do use a strap on for sex, it's as a ""treat"".  And on that point, I can say quality is better than quantity.  Before the op, we had sex about 7 times a week - and it always ended in me cumming. Now, I'd say we make it about half as many times, but the quality is amazing. As opposed to 15-20 minute sessions, we go on for over a good hour now sometimes and we often can't look at each other afterwards.  And as I don't have any penis, I don't always cum but that's alright as she has so many good orgasms now - in fact, we have shifted and she has more orgasms now than I do which I really enjoy as it gives me a massive ego boost. If before I didn't cum, it would be the end of the world but now we know that isn't the be all and end all.  Also, it's taught me that body confidence is a thing in itself. After I had the op, I had months where I couldn't face being naked around her as I felt ""less than"" or ashamed. Since I've been working on myself, I've learnt that being comfortable in your own skin goes a long way to feeling sexy - if you feel sexy, someone else will find you sexy too.  Lastly, I've learnt that communication is important especially about boundaries.  A few months back, my partner bought up the idea of pegging on myself and initially I was horrified. My last posts did nothing to help me as so many tried to talk me into it and I was so resistant.  We had a conversion about it again not so long ago and I dismissed it, saying flat out no. She asked me why and I said basically it would feel so emasculating to be bent over and ""fucked"" by her - it signifies all what has changed and has been lost by losing my willy. She said I don't have to be ""fucked"" by her at all, she just wanted to make me feel better about myself. We talked long and hard, and decided that if we try anal on me, she doesn't have to wear a strap on at all and we can use a non phallic toy to stimulate me without being""fucked"" at all.  We went over my last posts and found some good recommendations for genuine prostate massagers that we may try. But by communicating, we worked it out together.  It's early days yet, but I'm getting there and sexually in a far better place than I was 6 months ago. And because you all helped me out so much, I feel that this post is my chance to help others out the same way I was helped.  Thank you all so much! EDIT: Wow, gold and silver! Thank you so much kind strangers. Further edit: People ask me how I orgasm, or typically what it takes to get me there.  The vast majority of my orgasms come from having my balls, perineum and inner thighs stimulated typically by my partner's tongue. The feeling is a million times more intense now than it used to be, and being pleasured down there leads to ejaculation as well as an orgasm.  Also, I have had them from my nipples being played with. They have become an erogenous zone since my operation, and the orgasms are out of the world from them.  And also, for those asking, I still very much come. It comes from a hole created just behind my balls in the perineum area.

bv8p5u,"For some context, I'm in my early 20s, and among the few partners I've had, I noticed that they were selfish in bed not in any specific way that they intended to be, but it is an accumulation of how I think porn has portrayed expectations. I'm talking about expecting girls to be immaculately clean shaven (do I have stories about that, boy!) or the fact that oral on a girl is seen as a little warm up, short and sweet to get on with sex, but guys expect blowjobs to last till our jaws literally get sore.  Or how there's no room for soft and sensual build up, but it's a rush to jackhammer the shit out of you hoping you cum within a few minutes. Maybe I've had shitty boyfriends, I don't know. But I felt like sexually I was much more welcome by someone whose entire exposure to sex wasn't just HD porn in the internet. Just him telling me to lie down and relax and that we're not going anywhere until you're fully satisfied immediately made me feel like I'd upgraded from commercial to business class in the bedroom.  What do you think?",The older you get the better you get at fucking. I'm way better now than I was at 21. You learn and pick up tricks along the way. It's more of an experience thing than a generation thing in my opinion.,865

c59km5,"So, I've always liked anal sex. My girlfriend says she just like the taboo aspect of it, but she doesn't really crave it or doesn't really feel much pleasure. When we do it, I keep rubbing her clit so she can enjoy it more. Because of that, I bought her toys to play with, like butt plugs etc, hoping she might start to enjoy the kinky side of it. We have used the plug for two years now, and it's cool to fuck her pussy when she is plugged. On a side note, I've always tried to put things in my ass or my fingers but never really enjoyed it. Sometimes I wants to put things up there but when I try I never feel the pleasure I was hoping for.  Anyways, fast forward to last night. I was home alone and I was very horny, so I decide to make a nice masturbation session, with lube, nice videos etc. Then I saw her butt plug on the drawer and decided to try it in myself. Holy cow, I think my ass can't take more than a finger. I lubed the shit out of the butt plug but it took me almost 15 minutes to successfully insert that thing up there. I was painful, and I was trying to relax and I was taking it slow. Jesus, I can't believe I bought that shit for my girl. And it's not large! My dick is way way thicker than the plug. So I started to wonder how the fuck my girlfriend can take my dick in her asshole and now I don't want to fuck her ass anymore. I don't want to hurt her, she doesn't deserve that pain, lol.  Also, I think butt play is not for me, I will stop trying to put things up there. EDIT: As more and more people are commenting, I feel the need to clarify that I'll still keep fucking her in the ass. I was just surprised at how painful something so small can be, so I felt a lot of empathy towards my GF because I realized that my dick is way thicker than the plug, which means that the next time we want anal sex again, I will be extra cautious and caring. Also, I cleaned the plug with alcohol, don't worry.",Anal is tricky. I have to be SUPER turned on and relaxed to do it. One time my inner sex goddess came out when I was meeting up with a guy and literally just shoved him inside me. Don’t know how I did it and I’d be terrified to ever try it again tbh. I bet your GF knows how to relax and not have it hurt because believe me you’d know it if you hurt her.,3409
c9n5bo,"Sorry if this isn't really the right sub, but I figured someone here would have some advice.  Basically, I have female friends and lovers at my house on occasion, and while it's never been an issue before, I'd like to have some tampons and pads and stuff on hand just in case there's a need for some.  Trouble is, as a dude, I basically know nothing about what to get. I assume, based on the sheer variety of products available, that there must be some specifics involved in choosing which to get.  Is size a concern?  Do different brands make a difference?  Is there a way I can just get a giant variety pack or something?  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!","I would be sure to get unscented products. Sometimes the scents can cause irritation for some women .... In terms of tampon brands, I think that there’s not really a difference between a lot of them.  Unscented is the safest bet. They sell variety packs of tampons, with all different sizes, but I think you could also just get the “regular” size and be fine. The larger sizes aren’t always comfortable, once again it depends on the woman and her level of bleeding on a given day.  For pads, there are so many. Some women like wings (sticky pieces that make the pad wrap around your underwear), myself included. But I think that a plain, unscented pad without wings will be a general crowd pleaser. Again, brand doesn’t matter.  I would also buy a pack of hair ties if you’re interested! Nothing is more annoying than realizing in the middle of a sleepover or the next morning that you can’t put your hair up to hide the bedhead head, or even wash your face without long hair getting all wet. Last thing I would say, and this one only really applies if you’re talking about women sleeping over.... makeup remover! I’ve spent the night someplace unexpectedly and woken up with raccoon eyes because my mascara doesn’t wash off with water. It would be great to look and feel your best with a clean face.  Good question my dude! Everybody loves a considerate friend/partner.",2755
cb1or7," I have been stalking here for a while but I (,36F) quite recently discovered something which I just had to share as it has been almost life changing for me and maybe some others might benefit too! I have masturbated pretty much the same way my whole life, using one or two fingers and rubbing in a circular motion and up and down until orgasm.  It has always been effective and felt great. A couple months ago we were watching Netflix with me sitting between my guy's legs, leaning against his chest and he eventually reached between my legs and started stroking and feeling around.  It got hotter and hotter and eventually he was doing something to me which literally had me almost passing out with pleasure.  It was all under blankets etc. and my eyes were eventually closed so I couldn't really tell what he was doing with his hands but when I reached orgasm it turned out to be one of the biggest I ever had.  It felt AMAZING!   Once I recovered enough to speak I asked him what the hell he had just done to me!  He literally smirked (so freaking proud of himself) and told me he ""jerked me off"" like a guy masturbates.  I didn't know what he meant so he showed me how.  He literally gripped and stroked my clitoris like it was a small penis (which I suppose it is).  Fast forward to the next time I have some solo time and I did it for myself to see if it would feel as good.  I actually think I blacked out from pleasure!  It has become my new standard way to masturbate. So, for those of you interested in trying, this is how. (Disclaimer. I have quite a big clit I have been told, so it may not work the same for others with smaller clits?) Firstly I stroke myself the usual way until I can feel my clit get hard and start to stick out a bit.  Once hard and I can feel the shaft under my fingers I push the side of my thumb against the top of the clitoral shaft and, running my index finger between my lips get it under the clit head or glans so that I am sort of pinching or gripping the shaft and underside of the glans between my fingers. I then move my finger and thumb up and down the shaft from root to head and back again, pushing in at the base and pulling at the head part of the clit ... literally wanking myself like a mini penis. If things get a little too slippery I may use my thumb and two fingers, so that I don't loose grip on the shaft.  It feels incredible!!!! I am quite annoyed that I didn't ""discover"" it by myself when I obviously know my body better than anyone else, but it really hadn't occurred to me to try. Also, I would never admit to him that he ""taught me"" a new method. LOL!  As far as he knows it was a once-off! Anyway, I just thought I should share in case some other person benefits and learns something I wish I had learned decades ago! :P Give it a try if you're curious. :) As requested I have done a quick drawing to try help explain.  I am no artist but... http://imgur.com/gallery/O0kZCSK","I thought I was the only person who did this, I discovered it when I was about 17 after a few years of doing it the ""DJ"" way and taking forever to cum from it. It feels so fucking good and I cum so fast and hard, but whenever I suggest it to my female friends they don't want to try. I taught boyfriend how to do it too and I think every woman should, it's amazing!",948
cbzh95,"There’s the reason that it’s harder for me to enjoy sex with a stranger because who knows if I’ll cum or not but I was thinking about it today and it’s also because I don’t want to be treated like a porn star?  I don’t want to have to argue with guys about weather or not to use a condom or if they want to do something I’m not comfortable doing (I’ll suck your dick but I don’t want to be facefucked??? If I say no to anal once, that means I don’t want to do it.  Stop asking) or they’ll try to bend me in all of these uncomfortable positions. I just want sex that both of us can enjoy.  I don’t want to feel like all I am is a different way for someone to masturbate. I don’t know.  I just needed a rant.","I've recently decided to start having casual sex on purpose after multiple long-term relationships and some incidental flings that went pretty much the way OP described, and for the same reasons, I've entered into this project with caution. So far, I've chatted with lots of tinder matches, and unmatched those I thought would be selfish in bed based on conversation. I've met up with just 2 guys so far, one of them was nice enough during our date but afterwards I found out he was kind of ""expecting"" sex from me no matter what so I kicked him out because to me that was a giveaway that he would also be selfish - he took it really badly but that's his problem. The other guy was really constructive even in the tinder chat preceding our meeting - we agreed beforehand it would just be sex and he was the one who initiated discussing details before meeting - it was a refreshing change! We hooked up, it was pretty good, everything I wanted from a one-time booty call, and I thought that was that. So I was real surprised when I got a text from him asking if I wanted to meet up again and suggesting that we swap constructive feedback so we can go at it more prepared next time! To be honest, I was perplexed. But it seems like this is what people who are hooking up should be doing. It's a little unsexy, but I don't know, maybe it could lead to some pretty wild stuff! I'm curious. Just thought I'd share that, hope you find it relevant, the reason I did was because I too have been afraid of guys who are selfish in bed and it's only the beginning of my experiment to weed them out and still have lots of sex but I hope it works...",1592
cf7lkz,"Hello Reddit. I'm feeling a bit emotional right now, please excuse me if my rant sounds a bit stupid.  A week ago, my boyfriend and I achieved penetrative sex for the first time in our 5 months old relationship - and the first time in my life. I had tried doing that before him but it always felt incredibly painful and scary, a finger couldn't get in for some reason, it felt like burning and getting stabbed at the same time... which of course resulted in me not doing sexual stuff anymore in spite of my very high sex drive.  But I met that dude. I fell in love for the very first time and he fell in love too. The thing is, I really fucking sexually desire him. I decided to give penetration another go with him but of course it still didn't work: even one finger was impossible to fit in. Since I love this person so fucking much and felt very turned on by him, I decided to finally stop avoiding the issue: went to professionals, got diagnosed with vaginismus, cried myself to sleep countless nights, thought he'd leave me because I was feeling so inedequate, etc, etc.   But he understood. He never pressured me into anything; penetration was simply out of our repertoire. We would do oral, mutual masturbation, grinding, we'd do it in different and exciting contexts, explore some kinks, etc. Any time I'd feel like less-of-a-woman because of my vagina helplessly clenching, he'd tell me not to worry about it. Of course, I still worried, but he'd help me calm down.   That love gave me the strengh to face this issue. I bravely went to sexologists, started therapy, found the issues causing that, did plenty of daily exercises on my own... I worked hard for myself and to get rid of that painful condition.  We tried again when I was feeling ready. AND WE DID IT. I felt no pain nor discomfort. I actually fucking loved it and couldn't stop asking for it. We did it twice, then 5 times the day after, each time getting better. He was so gentle, would actively listen to me and tried his very best not to hurt me and to make sure I was having an amazing time.   We are both over the moon. I feel like a new woman - and it's partly thanks to him. I worked really hard to get there but so did he. He was understanding, kind, helped me feel better and less insecure. Anyone dealing with vaginismus knows how fucking irrational, sad and angry one can get because of that condition. It's fucking awful to feel broken in what feels like your very feminity during sex. And it's fucking awful not to be understood by your partner as you already feel so inadequate. I was sometimes being unfair to him because I was feeling so so bad, but he understood it completely.  Here is to understanding and loving sexual partners: You guys fucking rock.  People dealing with vaginismus: THERE IS HOPE. You will succeed, you are not broken, you are not useless, you deserve love and respect. You deserve to be pleased and you can please your partners too! Explore your sexuality that has nothing to do with PIV, it's so much fun for both parties. Don't let anyone tell you or treat you like are not enough or less-of-a-woman because that is fucking NOT true.  It's just a matter of time anyway. Please go see a specialist if you can, I am begging you. It's only when I did that that it started to improve. Don't be ashamed: TONS of women face this issue, you are not alone, and it absolutely gets better.  I love that guy. We had an amazing conversation when we succeeded for the first time. He told me he was not expecting it at all, that it was already the best sex he's ever gotten thanks to our curiosity and will to explore other things (even though he has always LOVED penetration), that he actually did not even necessary want it. He just wanted sex where we would both feel safe and comfortable. Of course it's supposed to be a norm, but plenty of people won't think like that and don't see sex as a shared activity supposed to be pleasurable for all parties involved. He's a fucking keeper.   TL;DR: vaginismus sucks. Understanding and loving partners are the best people out there.  Edit: what the fuck my dudes. I was not expecting that, I’m overwhelmed with all your love and support. Thank you so much for your kind answers and DMs, it means so much to me since I don’t have a lot of people to share this victory with. And now I’ve got an open vagina AND a gold to celebrate, my man is gonna be even happier tonight, hehe!! Anyway, thank you!  So many people asked me for more details on the techniques I used to overcome it. It’s not what works for everyone but maybe my experience can help a few. I’ve got no time right now to write it fully but I’m back home on Monday and I’ll make sure to reply to everyone who wanted to know more about it. Thank you again, this community is amazing.",That's awesome and this story made my day! What a beautiful soul of a man you have. He sounds like a for sure keeper girl.

chd8nw,"Hey, so I (23f) have been together with my boyfriend (24m) for 4 years now and we are really into submission, slapping, choking and forced sex. He basically has a free pass to use me in any way he pleases and me asking him to stop while screaming or crying isn't a reason to actually stop, we have a safe word for that. &#x200B; Recently he went too far, hurting me to a degree I wasn't enjoying anymore and I wanted him to stop. I don't know why, this has never happened before, but I sort of went brain dead. I couldn't think of our safe word to save my life. I was screaming, telling him to stop and tried pushing him away, but I tend to do that sometimes and it usually means that I haven't fully submitted yet. I couldn't actually push him away, as I'm rather petite and he's tall and muscular, close to double my weight, so he just pinned me down even harder. &#x200B; He provided great aftercare and apologized for it multiple times. It's obvious that he feels terrible for what he did to me. I completely believe that he didn't notice and he has always immediately stopped when I used our safe word. &#x200B; The issue is that I still feel violated.  We paused our role play, but I'm not even enjoying vanilla sex anymore. I just feel... I don't really know. Worthless and abused? &#x200B; He has been caring and loving about all of this and isn't approaching me for sex, rather cuddling and kissing me and I really appreciate that.

cjdz08," I'm a 34-year-old man who has struggled with ED since I was 18, and until very recently, I was a virgin. I dated a few girls and had a some random hookups in college, and I would always have an erection when dry humping and making out, but as soon as direct contact with the penis became involved I would go flaccid. I went to an endocrinologist and urologist and my testosterone levels were normal. I was also able to maintain normal erections when masturabating. I know that many men face the exact same scenario, so I've read a lot of advice on the Internet about it. The advice that I've read almost always comes down to the following: * Advice I'd heard: ""You're addicted to porn so your brain only responds to extreme porn stimuli, so it doesn't respond to real life women."" I definitely think there is some truth to the whole ‘Your Brain on Porn' movement. But I think it much better explains guys not finding real life sex to be very psychologically stimulating rather than explaining than my ED scenario. If I can get fully hard when making out with a girl, but then lose it once it actually becomes time to perform, how could it possibly be just because of porn? It was (and maybe still is) a contributing factor, but it can't explain the whole thing. * Advice I'd heard: ""It's because you're masturbating too hard with a (usually dry) hand, which feels nothing like a vagina/mouth/ass."" This is definitely a problem for me that I'm trying to fix, but I think it's much more about not being able to cum from anything other than your own hand rather than the type of ED I'm describing. I never even got to the point where I was putting it in a vagina/mouth/ass. * Advice I'd heard: ""Just get a prescription for Viagra/Cialis, use it to get over the psychological hump, then wean yourself off of it."" I actually do have a prescription for Viagra (and got one in my early 20s also), and when I've tried it during masturbation sessions it definitely works ridiculously well. However, it never worked during sexual encounters, even when I took a large dose (~100 mg). This is extremely common for guys who suffer from psychological ED. * Advice I'd heard: ""It's because of nerves, find a girl is really understanding and willing to take it slow."" This is definitely true, and good advice, but too generic and non-actionable to actually solve the issue for me. ---- **So now I want to share my actual concrete experience and advice.** I had mostly given up on dating in my early 20s after basically every one of my sexual encounters had ended awkwardly, coming to peace with the fact that I would probably die a virgin.  At age 34 I recently met a single 30-year-old woman and we quickly became enamored with one another. She wanted to take things slow, so we kept everything above the belt for the first couple of dates.  On our third date, we were making out and I had already taken 80 mg of Viagra, so I was pretty hard. As things progressed I was excited that I had finally ""gotten over it"" (chemically assisted), but then as soon as she popped my dick out and started to stroke it, it went soft again. I confessed to her at this point that this is why I didn't really date, and told her that I would really appreciate if she gave me a few more chances, but that I didn't expect her to stick around forever if I couldn't get it working. She was super understanding and told me that she didn't care that much about PIV sex and that if it never happened it would still be fine with her (which was almost certainly a white lie, but did help with the anxiety aspect). After that I decided to really try to analyze what the hell was going on. **I realized that literally all 10+ of my sexual encounters happened almost the exact same way: I would be making out with a girl for a while with a little bit of grinding, and during this time I would be 50%-70% hard (it's difficult to get beyond this wearing jeans). When things progressed, she would reach down into my pants or unzip my pants and start to fondle my penis. This is when things would go south.** I knew that it never felt *good* when a girl's dry hands rubbed on my dry penis, but I always thought this was my problem. For one thing, it's how *every single one* of my sexual encounters progressed, so I assumed that basically every other guy must love it. Moreover, it's exactly how I masturbate! So if I masturbate by rubbing my own dry hand on my penis and have no problem staying hard and enjoying it, but when a girl does it it doesn't feel good and makes me go soft, then the problem must be in my brain, right? After a lot of thought, I came to realize two important things. **First, I realized that a dry hand rubbing on a dry dick doesn't *actually* feel good to me.** I conditioned myself to masturbate that way out of habit and convenience. Growing up as a teenager in 1998-2003 when the only device with Internet was a shared family PC, I had to be fairly sneaky when I masturbated to porn, so I just conditioned myself to use my hand without lube even though I didn't actually enjoy it for a long time. It's like eating a bowl of unseasoned porridge for breakfast every morning since you're 13. It doesn't actually taste good but you're just so used to it. **Second, and maybe more importantly, there's a *huge* psychological effect when someone else touches your penis.** If you're 60% hard from making out, and a girl starts stroking your penis, there's a massive unspoken expectation that you're going to get fully hard within a minute. Worse, when the erection starts to go down even a little bit from this, women almost universally take this as a sign that they should increase the intensity and start yanking and pulling on it more aggressively. This creates a feedback loop because it's not physically pleasurable at all and makes you feel super pathetic in your own head to have someone else desperately tugging on your soft cock. At that point I would just go completely flaccid, and there was basically no coming back for the entire night.  **So, after the next date with my girlfriend, when we started making out I just told her ""Hey, just so you know I don't really like it when dry hands rub my penis. I love vagina and mouths (note: I assumed) but hands just don't feel that good to me, especially dry.""** She was like ""Oh wow, I never thought about that before, but it makes total sense. Like it feels awful to rub my clit and vagina unless I'm super wet, but guys don't self-lubricate."" **When things started to progress, I took off my pants and boxers and just let my erect penis press up against her. She rubbed my inner thighs and pubic bone but never touched my actual penis with her hand.** Without being restricted by pants or uncomfortably yanked on, it was able to grow to a full erection on its own accord. When she was ready for sex, I got on top of her in missionary position, I rubbed my penis against her clit a few times and then slowly slid it in. I didn't have a problem maintaining an erection for the entire session, and honestly once I'm inside I can't really feel the difference between a 100% erection and an 80% erection anyways (which a hand can definitely feel), since at that point it's mostly a difference in texture rather than size. I was on Viagra for that encounter but we had sex again the next day in the exact same way without any chemical assistance. We didn't use a condom because she has an IUD and we both got tested last week, which of course made things a lot easier.  I still can't cum just from just sex or blowjobs, but that's a physical issue from Death Grip Syndrome rather than psychological. Since we're long distance and I can only see her once a month, I still masturbate but much more infrequently and only with a fleshlight. But it's not a huge issue in my mind since it means I can just go indefinitely (with Viagra at least) and then just finish myself off with my hand when I need to. **I don't think that this will be the cure for everyone, but I hope that some men or women out there will find it useful or at least interesting :)**","This post offers unsolicited advice on a common topic covered in the FAQ.

cjugih,"So, that's pretty much what the title says. We were having sex and decided to record everything, I put my cellphone on recording mode and we fucked for fiteen minutes.

The few times he has gone down on me I told him how wonderful it feels and what a great job he is doing. I even try to describe exactly what to do to make it even better and have suggested different positions to make it more comfortable for him.  He doesn't bother to listen to me. It makes me feel ugly and undesirable when he won't don't this one thing. Especially when I take pretty good care of myself.

cplxkf,"Disclaimer: throwaway account.  Three months ago my fiancé tragically died. I am still absolutely devastated and have been trying to sit with my grief and learn that the process is not linear. That being said, nobody knows how to talk about the lost sex.   I have a history of sexual trauma and my fiancé was the only person I had actually trusted enough to fully open up to about my personal journey with sex. He accepted me fully and never made me feel like a worthless POS because of it (unlike previous men). He embraced my hesitancy, my dissociation, my panic attacks, my depression, etc with an open heart and open mind. If I ever got to a point where I needed to stop, I would tell him and he would listen to me and hold me. Until him, I had never allowed myself to be so vulnerable with another person, not even my therapists. He loved me for me and that’s that. His love helped me begin to truly heal from the inside out.  With him, I felt pure joy for the first time in my life.   This being said, the sex we had was absolutely unbelievably good. Breathtaking, passionate, soulful sex. He told me from the beginning that his kink was watching me cum. And that I did (and he did too)... Every. Single. Time. Never in my life have I experienced anything that has come close to the intense physical love that we shared together. He was just so GOOD in bed. We experimented together (something I was always terrified of doing), we laughed together (when I started screaming after he accidentally came right on my eyeballs), and we fucked each other everyday without fail.   Through losing him I lost a huge part of myself. I lost our future together, I lost the six children we wanted to have, I lost all of the adventures we had on our bucket list, and I lost the mind blowing sex. That, my friends, is one of the hardest parts. I used to be horny all the time, now it’s rare if I ever feel sexual. On the off chance that I do go to bed horny, I’ll get myself off, and then I will start to uncontrollably cry immediately after. My vagina has completely dried up and smells really funky now (I bathe regularly and keep myself clean, it’s not bad hygiene or an infection).   I feel as if I have lost half of my body, my mind, my heart, my soul. Nobody knows how to talk about it. Nobody knows what to say. I don’t blame anyone, but it’s such a HUGE part of my grief and one that I feel like I have to hide away.   To anyone that might also be experiencing this, you’re not alone.   TLDR: fiancé died 3 months ago. I have a history of  sexual trauma. We had amazing sex. My vagina is sad.  EDIT: Wow... I just woke up and this blew up. A gold and two silvers?

cpx6us,"I know there are a lot of men out there who are extremely insecure because they don’t have big muscles or toned abs but from a woman’s point of view I think that’s better! I much prefer a man who has a little bit of stomach fat and some booty for me to squeeze. I’m not saying that people who like to have a toned body aren’t attractive, because you are, but I’m trying to tell the men who are chubby or overweight that there are a lot of women out there who prefer this. To me there’s nothing better than being able to cuddle a soft tummy or hold some thick hips while I’m having sex. A typical dad bod is absolutely glorious, and many people overlook this. I’ve found that this body type is a lot more of a turn on, and if you’re confident with it, it helps also. Scratching your nails down their back is brilliant too. There’s just something about it.

cqj9ds,"i’m 18, and my parents have always told me sex is bad and i shouldn’t have it or else i’ll get pregnant and ruin my life. i used to get disgusted with myself after masturbating but i learned to accept that it’s okay.   my boyfriend came to visit and they tried to do everything to make sure we don’t get any private time alone. they even told me that i shouldn’t even need sex education and i should just know not to do it. i wasn’t even allowed to sit on a bed with my boyfriend with the doors open to watch a movie. he wasn’t even allowed to sit next to me at the dinner table because they saw him touch my leg one time. however we were smart enough to find ways around it and we did lose our virginities to each other and i don’t regret it.  my mom asked me if we snuck off anywhere to do anything weird, anything that gives me a chance at pregnancy, that if she can trust me. she asked “you’re not one of those horrible kids right?”. i told her i would never do such thing and she seemed relieved and approving of what i said. then she left the room and every time she did this or said this sorta thing i felt guilty and disgusted at myself but now i feel resentment towards her. sex is okay. right? i shouldn’t have to be guilty or disgusted at myself or shamed, as long as it was respectful and safe and enjoyed by both parties.  UPDATE: i didn’t expect this to get so many replies. thank you for all of your kind responses and reassurance, i’m more confident there’s no need for me to be guilty of what i did. this sub has made me be more comfortable with my sexuality and curiosity when before i was afraid and ashamed. my parents i’ve realized the past year have hurt me a lot emotionally in many other ways other than this and i want to escape it but i just don’t know how yet. i also really want therapy for it but my parents would guilt me for getting it and i can’t afford it on my own. and my parents are not very religious and their reasons don’t seem to be because of their beliefs but rather because of the asian culture. again, thank you all for this",Your parents are literally terrible for teaching you to feel this way about sex.

cvsi3h,"Hi all, You guys have been so good to me this past year, I felt I've had to share my good news with you all.  So I'm the guy who lost my penis due to cancer - you can check out my post history for more details.  I'd been struggling so much since April, especially since me and my partner separated. I'd been trying so much too - stimulating my nipples, testicles, perineum and even my prostate with an Aneros Helix.  Nothing has been working that well, so I thought I'd do something I have been thinking of but not acted on - I booked a sex worker! It took me a while of looking through ads but I found one I thought was perfect - she's hot, a similar age and it said she does women on her profiles so I thought she'd probably not find my physical ""challenge"" too daunting. When I called her, she was so understanding and said she'd gladly work with me.  I'd booked 2 hours with her, and it was just enough for me.  She messaged me well, and let me kids her - it was so good! I asked if I could give her oral/finger her but she said she only does that with guys she knows so maybe next time if I see her! Cool by me.  She really took her time going down on me, she was really caring and attentive. I also said I was willing for her to use her fingers on my ass to stimulate my prostate - I said I'm only up for that, no dildos or anything and I'm not looking at being pegged which she understood. The technique was amazing, I think my toy I have isn't quite reaching my prostate like her fingers did.  And I came! God it was intense, it shot out my hole so fucking hard it was like a geyser! I almost passed out too - I've never felt anything like that. She was really cool, really enjoyed it - and said it's a refreshing change to have a guy who's not just focused on a quick fuck. She said I have nothing to worry about how my body looks too and said that she'd gladly see me again and let me do things to her! I feel human again now. ",That's a genuinely uplifting story.,1517

czz3xc,"Last night my wife and I went to our local sex shop for a woman’s pleasure class and it gave me a lot of new perspectives on female pleasure. There was a lot of great stuff in there about anatomy and using lube but here are some things that really stuck out to me. (All cunnilingus related because that’s my favorite) *Anchor your open mouth on her pussy and use your tongue internally. That way she can buck on your face when she’s feeling good* I used to think I needed to stick out my tongue and lick. This will make things a lot easier fir the future.  Edit: a lot of people are asking what this means. Basically what I meant was keep your head in place and move you tongue, not your head.  *Affirm to her that your enjoying eating her pussy when your down there* I LOVE eating pussy, there have beer times when women have made me stop because they felt bad that I’ve been down there so long. If you make yummy sounds and tell her how much you love it during the act, you get to eat more pussy  *When you are going down on her, start with variety, end with consistency* Start by working your tongue on her pussy and then when you find the groove, just keep the same rhythm/motion so she can get comfortable in the motion.  Definitely looking forward to implementing this stuff!","Something I never hear addressed:  temperature.  Your mouth is warm.  Your breath (on the way out) is warm.

d0eubn,"24F. This is going to be a long one but I wanted to share my story so that other people who have gone through something similar know that there is hope and that they’re not alone.  When I was 16-20 years old I dated a guy who abused me in every way possible, just short of beating. He used me for sex. It was always about him. It was always coerced and there were many times that he downright raped me and made me believe that it was normal and that I “owed” it to him. He hurt me during sex and bragged about it to his friends. I was able to escape when I was 20, but I had scars. I was scared of sex. I thought all men were the same and just wanted one thing from me. I was in college at the time, but I never went out. I kept dating to a minimum. I had a general fear of men. Fast forward to last year. I was newlywed and my husband has been super understanding and amazing about the whole thing. Ever since I met him he never wanted to push me or do anything I wasn’t comfortable with to the point that we actually stopped having sex for a long time because he could read on my face that I was just waiting for it to be over. He didn’t feel comfortable having sex if it was only good for him. We had a long talk about how he wanted a hiatus from sex and that I should seek treatment and he would be there to support me. I didn’t realize that sex was supposed to be good for me too. I didn’t realize I had a problem until we had this talk. So I agreed to seek help for the sake of our relationship. I tried several therapists and self help books but didn’t feel like I was getting anywhere until I started seeing a sexologist a couple months ago. She has helped me work through the trauma and my resulting attitudes towards men and sex. She gave me exercises that I have been working on to help me reframe sex in my mind. She made me realize that I was healing for me, not for my husband. She helped me realize that my pleasure matters and if I didn’t care about myself and healing for my own sake, I would never be able to have a healthy sexual relationship with my husband. I mattered. Flash forward to last night. My husband and I were making out in bed. I started making out with him again a week ago because I felt ready to start being physical again but wanted to ease into it. I wasn’t planning to have sex last night but it felt natural. The whole time he kept reassuring me how everything was okay, how he wasn’t going to hurt me, how he cared about me and wanted me to feel good, and that I mattered. That last one was the most important. He reassured me that he knew that my pleasure mattered and that I was in control. It was so hot and so comforting at the same time. We both came together and I cried afterwards as he held me because that was the first time I had ever had truly consensual and fulfilling sex.  Many times throughout this process I thought rather hopelessly that I would never be comfortable with sex. That I was damaged beyond repair. I am so relieved now that I see change is happening and also so proud of myself for how far I’ve come since the abuse. EDIT: I am overwhelmed by all of the love and support I have received. I truly wasn’t expecting it. Thank you. I have also received some messages and comments from people who have been or are in my situation. I made this post specifically for you. I want you to know that you are not broken. If your relationship has love you can overcome anything. Trauma is different for everybody but with the right tools it can be overcome. I’m so happy that this post has touched hearts and stand in solidarity with you all.  EDIT 2: A few people have asked how I managed to find a gem of a man and marry him while simultaneously being afraid of men and scarred from my experience. The answer is that I got lucky. I stumbled into the right one. I met my husband 1 year after I escaped my abusive ex. He never pushed me and I felt safe with him. We didn’t even kiss until the 9th date. He is amazing and was more than okay with taking things slow for me. We started having sex as well, but once he got to know me better he started to see that I wasn’t really present and not actually enjoying it, hence the hiatus and therapy. EDIT 3: A couple people have asked for examples of the exercises my sexologist gave me. The one that meant the most to me actually didn’t have to do with sex. It was writing a letter to my abusive ex with everything I wanted to say to him. You’re not actually supposed to send it because the less contact with the abuser the better. But I had a lot of pent up justified anger and I wasn’t letting it out. I didn’t even realize I had it until I started going to therapy. I sat down and wrote the meanest and angriest letter I could. Everything I had ever wanted to say to him. Then I burned it, and I was able to move on from the anger.  I later learned that my anger was manifesting in my relationship to all men in general, so letting it go improved my emotional relationship with my husband, even though I had never been angry with him personally. Another exercise that helped was one where I took long baths and spent a lot of time getting to know myself and becoming comfortable with my sexuality. Previously I had felt ashamed of my body and of my sexuality. Both of these attitudes had been installed by my abuser so he could control me. I spend many weeks just getting comfortable with myself, finding out what I liked and what I didn’t like. Slowly learning that there was nothing to be ashamed of.",Trauma is a bitch and you're kicking its ass. I'm happy for you.     I also had treatment with a sexologist before and they are amazing.

d3o50o,"Edit for disclaimer: this is a dedicated throwaway solely for this post. You're obviously welcome to award it for visibility, but just letting y'all know this account won't see much if any use after this post.   Original post: So I know how most of the connections made between enthusiasm and blowjobs are aimed at women. How do you give a good blowjob? Be enthusiastic. Want it. Etc. And that's all very valid. But it's important to remember that male enthusiasm makes a big difference too. I never 'minded' blowjobs. I actually kinda liked them when I was first giving them. I don't like receiving oral though, never did. My first partner would continuously want to perform oral on me, which I often begrudgingly gave into, and then get an attitude akin to 'my turn'. I never minded the blowjob as an act. What I did mind, was the attitude he had about them. I would've given them freely and enthusiastically, but he never seemed to believe that. He always seemed to have to 'earn' one first.  He treated it like something I did solely for him. And so I came to see it as something I solely did for him. I didn't like giving blowjobs anymore. It became a chore. He never thanked me for them either, since he'd earned them, and he never really gave me any feedback. It wasn't something I did to him, but rather something done to him. I felt like I wasn't even in the picture. I'd suck him off, he wouldn't finish from that, so he'd jerk himself to orgasm. Which is fine, but I was never really able to improve or change stuff up.  We eventually broke up as young people do and after some experimenting (and Tinder) I met my current partner. I would occasionally suck him off, but never with a goal of orgasm.  One day, I decided I'd try and make him come from a blowjob, on his birthday. I was still thinking as if a good blowjob had to be earned, or be on a special day or something. Crazy how much ideas can get into your head. So I looked up tips for good blowjobs and eventually found [The Blowjob Manifesto](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9k4pl8/should_i_18f_surprise_my_boyfriend_18m_with_a_bj/e6whv46?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). I studied for an afternoon and then proceeded to give him The Blowjob that changed my life.  He had an orgasm, and was flabbergasted. He told me he never came from blowjobs, especially not after having some alcohol. That I'd blown his mind and that it felt *amazing*. During the blowjob, he'd also been moaning and making light surprised noises. I felt my ego swell up like a balloon. I felt giddy. Happy. We snuggled and went to sleep. Some time (months) after that, I realised I actually *wanted* to blow him. That's when I decided ""fuck the rules"" (that I'd been following without second thought, about earning them or special days), I'll just give a blowjob when I want to give one. It's not just his, it's also mine.  I love blowjobs now. I love trying new stuff, making him go crazy, hearing the sounds he makes, feeling him grasp at my hair. I love that I'm not rushed, that I can just spend as long as I want down there and that it's about the blowjob, not the orgasm (although they almost always happen). I love hearing a jagged ""You're soooooooo *good*"" afterwards, and I love that a blowjob can just be a blowjob without me having to receive something as well.  Tl;dr: blowjobs are not a commodity. If you, as a man, treat them as such, your partner will start to do the same, and you will both lose.","Thiiiis. My man moans, growls, grabs the sheets, gasps...

d4i9lx,"My girlfriend is generally very self-conscious about getting eaten out. She’s told me it’s a combination of her being able to feel when my tongue starts to get tired and then worrying that she’s not coming fast enough which makes it even harder for her to cum and being worried that she’s not clean enough (never the case), so she’ll often stop me before cumming and we’ll proceed to have PIV or anal. She does cum occasionally, but it usually does take some time. Lately she’s been trying to gain weight so she bought some weed to enhance her appetite, but holy shit, has it been a game changer for our sex life...  She’s MUCH more comfortable while high, cums after a minute of her riding my face (which is insanely hot), and she’s not afraid to ask me for more, so we’ll go at it several times until she’s cummed at least 5-10 times and is barely able to move.

In fact, knowledge of detailed clitoral anatomy is essential for safe FtM GRS surgery. My anatomic study of the clitoris will actually be the first in a major plastic surgery journal, and this will likely help trans men.  Clitoral anatomy is extremely important to the sexual health of people with vulvas. Because most people with vulvas are female, and because this anatomy has historically been excluded due to issues to do with biological sex, I am going to leave “female” in place of “people with vulvas” for the rest of this post. This makes sense in such cases where discussing “female sexual medicine” and “female sexual function” because that is how it is defined in medical literature. I am doing my best here, and I hope this is okay.  At the end of the day, despite the resistance I have faced, I have been effective at getting detailed clitoral anatomy into OB/GYN literature for the first time. This is important and relevant to this Reddit community, as I continue to see many women post about problems with their clitorises and with difficulty orgasming.  The fact is that female orgasm is very important. And the clitoris is the primary somatosensory organ of female sexual response. As such, its anatomy should be shown in detail in OB/GYN textbooks and in anatomy textbooks.  Female sexual medicine should have an anatomic basis just like male sexual medicine. When women complain of difficulty orgasming, the problem is not always psychological. In my case, it certainly wasn’t. I had a nerve injury caused by an improperly performed surgery, and yet I was told I just needed to relax and fall in love.  I have been contacted by women who have suffered injuries from childbirth, disastrous waxing appointments, sexual assault, improperly performed biopsies, and genital cosmetic surgeries. I do not want other women to struggle like I have.  Also, in a cadaver study I did with plastic surgeons, the dorsal nerves in the clitoris were 2-3 mm in diameter. There are no other nerves of this size routinely left out of anatomy illustrations. One reason this is important for doctors to know is because they are actually large enough to be repaired if injured. Women are just as entitled to such repairs as men. Understanding of anatomy is fundamental to understanding how organs work. This is accepted for all other parts of the body. It should be no different with female genitals. Update: thanks so much for all the support! This is just the first step. It is in one major OB/GYN textbook. But I’d like to see this level of detail in all OB/GYN textbooks and anatomy textbooks too. This is why I keep posting to raise awareness.  Also, while this is amazing progress, this illustration isn’t exactly correct. I’m hoping the illustrations with my study will be better. But after struggling to work with a previous illustrator, I realize getting it exactly right can be hard.",Too bad it’s not mandatory reading for boyfriends...,379
d7jpiv,"Holy shit I just had the hottest sex with my boyfriend. Generally our sex is pretty average, and tbh it’s because he’s a little vanilla. For some reason a switch flipped in him today, not sure if it’s confidence or what but he shocked me.  We were just cuddling and talking about our days, when he gives me kind of a silly aggressive kiss. I kiss him back and joke about us kissing so hard we mush together and form one human being. Lol. So he grabs the back of my hair and I grab his head and we start kissing, jokingly at first and then it became more passionate. We were full on making out, tongues in each other’s mouths just really going at it. He tugged on my lip and I bit his back. He groaned and told me “I’m going to teach you a lesson.” He climbed on top of me, grabbed my throat and started to choke me (gently but enough to restrict my airway) while he bit and kissed all over my neck, down to my chest and nipples.  He kept smacking my ass and I laughed about it stinging and he said “that’s the idea”. Ended up fucking me so hard we came at the same time and we were just covered in sweat.  This has been a revolutionary week for me as the past few months our sex life has really slowed down. Just this week we have had sex THREE times. Which is a lot for us.

I climbed on top of him and all of a sudden he held me in place, looked up at me, and I mean, *really looked* and says “you should see your body from this angle”. He said it with so much love and lust in his voice and now I’m sitting here a day later and I can’t get his words out of my head. This man, this beautiful man, who I think is a hundred times out of my league, loves my body. Like, really loves it. When I think about what he would see from his angle, I picture large thighs positioned on either side of him, a tummy that is not flat, large breasts that hang down. Maybe a double chin and a crazy mess of curly hair. He looks up at me and sees a beautiful woman, who has soft skin and curves,  a big smile on my face, and a body that’s capable and wanting to have sex with him. I love every single inch of my partners body. I think he’s the sexiest man to walk the earth. He has a fantastic ass and strong arms. He has a soft but defined stomach, a smile that gives me butterflies, and a great head of hair. He’s tall and beautiful. I know there’s parts of his body he doesn’t love, but I’m blind to them all. To me, he’s perfect the way he is. He turns me on like nobody else ever has. So why can’t I do the same to him? So this is just an appreciation post for our partners and our bodies. We really do see the worst in ourselves. We focus in on the things that we wish we could improve. This is a shout-out to all of the partners who make their SOs feel appreciated and sexy. So take your partners word for it that they find you desirable. Don’t let yourself get in your head and be the reason you don’t let loose and have a great time. Start to appreciate and love your body as much as your partner does.  Edit: I love this sub so much. I love reading all of your comments and I love all of you! You guys are all beautiful, and the human form as a whole is mesmerizing, regardless of the size, shape, colour, weight or so-called flaws we have. Keep being sexy and don’t let it hold you back ❤️",Precious. I hope you get more of this.,902
d8csv0,"Yesterday we were making out and getting touchy with each other. Smiling, laughing. All of a sudden she pauses, and says in the most calm voice, “we really gotta work on your kissing. Don’t open your mouth so much, use a bit less tongue.... yeah, like that.” I was ecstatic that she was comfortable being so up front and saying that to me, rather than just brushing it off and ignoring my awful kissing skills. I never want to stop improving and becoming better, whether it’s in bed or simply kissing. So to have someone like her who encourages me to do exactly that is all I could ever ask for.  Guys and gals, don’t be afraid to speak up and help your partner out where they may be lacking! The right partner will not be mad at you just for trying to help :) and it will foster a relationship where both feel comfortable communicating their thoughts! Edit: Wow! This got so much more activity than I ever expected! A big thank you to all who have commented. It’s been a joy reading all your stories, and I will do my best to reply to each of you :)",This is so wholesome. I love hearing partners build on the relationship and open up the communication. I'm lucky. My SO is so great about this.,1456
d9cy27,"With the right clothing, I feel like my body looks really good and put together. When I'm naked, my self esteem drops and I don't feel as confident about my body. Boobs look more saggy, ass looks long, and thighs look way more huge.  It doesn't stop me from being sexually active, but I still don't feel 100% good about my naked body. Anyone else?","It sort of depends on the day? Sometimes I think I look hot naked, sometimes only with clothes on.  I think it’s more of a mood thing of when I’m feeling generally confident or not.",898
d9wc9p,"A couple days ago my husband and I had an awkward moment. We were both sleep deprived and exhausted, but both wanted it so we were kinda forcing things.....he lost his erection (pretty rare for him, and clearly a blow to his ego) and in the moment, I got upset and visibly frustrated. I felt awful afterwards because we have an awesome sex life and 99.9 percent of the time, he leaves me so satisfied I'm fucking numb. I sent him an apology and long winded text about all the amazing things he does to my body. I've sent short snips of dirty talk and pictures before, but this was almost a novel...very raw, honest, detailed description of how his body makes mine feel and how it feels when I cum. Holy shit girls, I've had more orgasms in the last 2 days than most people have in 2 weeks! I'm sore and stinky but goddamn! Let your man know he's doing a good job, and see how motivated he gets!",Who knew compliments and positive feedback / reinforcement could be beneficial?,2751
dagadz,"Hey guys, I just stumbled over the post where someone asked whether men enjoyed being kissed on the forehead, too. This is just a quick reminder to all of you - men are human beings. Just like women. Just like nonbinary folk. We ALL are human, we all crave touch, intimacy and care. I often found it to be the case that men were expected to be tender, caressing, loving, and the most tender touch they received in return was a hand on their shoulder or maybe a hug. Cut that shit. Cuddle the hell out of them. Kiss their foreheads, their noses, tell them their eyes are beautiful and their lips kissable, shower them in soft attention. Hug them, spoon them, ask them to lay their heads in your laps so you can play with their hair. Bring them flowers, wrap them in blankets. Do all that soft, romantic shit you want to feel yourself. This isn't even about ''let them cry'' anymore, by now we should all be aware that emotions aren't gendered. But be loving. Be gentle. Be reassuring, playful and sweet. We all need it.    EDIT: OMG. I just came back and I did NOT expect this to blow up like this - thank you so, so much for the platinum, kind stranger! Had a rough few days, and this has me grinning like an idiot... thank you so much. <3   It's wonderful to see this little nugget spread, I'm glad y'all agree with me. You rock!","My bf and I almost prefer it when he's the little spoon, or when he lays with his head on my boobs and I hold his head. It makes me wonder if he'd always been the protector, never the one being held (he's a big strong guy). I absolutely love being the one who can provide him that comfort and security!",1211
db51yi,"I am the only one in my entire friendship group that actually enjoys blow jobs. It’s absolutely crazy to me how not only none of my friends like it, they hate it! I think it’s one of the sexiest things ever and probably my favourite part of sex in general.  There’s nothing hotter than kneeling in front of a guy and unzipping his pants to find he’s hard and then taking him into your mouth. Sometimes I even get excited to see he’s soft too, I really like the feeling of him getting hard in my mouth. I love everything about it. I love the idea of sucking it. love being so close and personal to his cock. I love tasting his pre cum. I love hearing him moan in pleasure. I love seeing his toes curl. I love feeling him explode in my mouth. I just love everything about it.  I think I’m very good at oral sex, part of that is technique but I think a huge part of that is my attitude towards it. I don’t need to be on my period to suck cock, I don’t need to be bribed or asked to suck cock. I genuinely love it. I actually feel like I should thank him for letting me suck him... is that crazy? It feels like a gift haha. I think the way you approach oral sex and your attitude towards it is probably equally as importantly technique. But, here are some things I like to do that I think make it even better for the guy... - Eye contact. It makes me feel so dirty and submissive to look up at him while I suck his cock. I think the eye contact makes it so sexy. - I like to tease at first by kissing his thighs, slowly working my way to his balls.  - Never ever forget about the balls! This is so important. Lick them slowly, lick them fast, lick them with the tip of your tongue (make it pointed), lick them with your tongue flat and definitely suck them but be very very gentle! - Lick all the way from the base of his dick to the tip.  - Slapping his dick across your face usually goes down well. - Always always always continue to lick his head while you suck. Swirl your tongue around, up and down, side to side, anything. Just keep it moving constantly. Sucking shouldn’t be just up and down, your tongue works wonders! - Dirty talk! Silence is fine, moans are better but dirty talk is much sexier. Make sure he’s into it though, not every guy might be but I find telling him how wet you are, how much this is turning you on, how much you love his dick or how much you want him inside you, how your his slut, will always go down well. - Moan moan moan! He’s going to love hearing you moan while you suck him. He will also feel the vibrations of you moaning on his dick too. - Try and deep throat, if you can, brilliant. If you can’t, take as much as you can for as long as you can then gag and tell him how big he is and how you can’t take it all but how much it turns you on trying. No guy is going to unhappy hearing his dick is too big for your mouth. - Fake deep throating. Make sure your hand is wet, stroke him and suck the tip in your mouth. This will stop the gagging, mean you can focus all your attention on his head and also give him the feeling of deep throating. - masturbate if you can, I’ve found that if your able to play with yourself while doing it then that just sends guys over the edge. Not only does it show how into it you are, it also feels so dirty and if your wet enough they will be able to hear that while you suck his dick.  - Ask him where he wants to cum/tell him where you want him to cum. If you have no preference where he finishes then ask him what he likes, just make it sexy! If he says he wants to cum in your mouth, something like ‘mmmm, you want to fill up my mouth with that cum?’ Or ‘empty your balls into my mouth’ would work. If you don’t like it in your mouth then say something like ‘I want you to cum in my face, I want to feel like your dirty slut’ is much better than ‘no I don’t like the taste of cum’ - If he’s taking too long and your mouth is sore then tell him your so horny you can’t wait anymore, you need him inside of you right now. This is much better than ‘are you almost done? My jaw hurts’  - Compliment his dick but make sure you mean it. If he’s not the biggest hen he’s going to know that, don’t tell him he’s huge because he will know your lying, tell him how hard his cock is and how good it feels in your mouth. If he is big then definitely make sure to tell him! Make sure you tell him how big and full his balls are, how good his cum tastes, how sexy he looks while you suck his cock, how attractive his cock is, how sexy he sounds moaning for you etc. Guys need compliments too! But they must be genuine. - Surprise him with blow jobs. A wake up blow Job or shower job will always go down well. Wait until he’s on the phone of playing Xbox and unzip his pants, make it feel naughty. - I can’t remember the actual word for it, but the thin line on his balls (should be straight down the middle separating both his testicles) is very sensitive. You must be super gentle but licking this very carefully should feel amazing for him. - Don’t wait to be asked to suck his dick. Start sucking before he even has a chance to ask for a blow job, show him how much you love it by doing it by choice, not because he asked. - Don’t ask for oral back every single time you suck his dick. It makes it look like a chore and that your only doing it to get something in return. It’s fine to do this sometimes, but if it’s every single time it gives the impression you only do it to get oral back. If he offers himself that’s different of course. - If your happy to swallow his cum then great. If your not then try and make it sexy. Let him cum in your mouth and then let it drip down on to your breasts (or let him cum on them if you don’t even want it in your mouth) and then rub his load into your boobs like lotion. Make sure to smile and make eye contact while you do it. EDIT: Wow! That’s for all the responses, I didn’t expect this to blow up (pun intended). I just wanted to add that of course you need to get permission to suck his dick before you actually do it, especially if it’s a surprise. I just figured that went without saying so I didn’t feel the need to mention that. Another thing, I didn’t mean you shouldn’t want oral in return, I just meant don’t ask for it as it looks like your doing it to be pleasured back, I didn’t mean you shouldn’t want your pussy licked. Yes my post is very ‘porn star’ but I mean.... how many guys are going to complain that you suck dick like a porn star? I literally can’t think of any! If the guy your with doesn’t like something I’m sure he will tell you and you can change that. Communication is obviously key! Also, I’m definitely female ","I feel the same way eating pussy. I’m average in size and haven’t had any complaints, but I can do things with my tongue that I could never do during sex.  My favorite is when she hits that “O” and tries to climb the headboard away from me. I just pull her closer and let those waves crash over her. Not only is it a huge ego boost, but seeing the look on her face is amazing",2566
dcbctu,"My boyfriend has been incredibly stressed out at work. Huge project deadlines, a shitty boss. His libido has really been suffering these past few weeks. I realized that even though I was unhappy, he just couldn't muster up any fun and libido.  I decided to change it and make it all about him. I surprised him one evening and told him to have a shower and to relax in the bedroom. I put on some candles, some soft music and low lights, and even though I suck at massages, I offered him a long and slow one. Just told him to relax and let his mind drift off. Naturally, after sometime, I turned him over and did the thing I was much more proficient at. I started off slowly with just my fingers but graduated to my lips and throat afterwards. I made sure everything was slow and relaxing for him. Even as the intensity ramped up, I slowed it down from time to time for him to enjoy.  Wouldn't you believe it, with all this de-stressing, his libido came roaring back and I was able to finish him off with just my tongue. He felt waves of stress melt away and I think for the first time in a couple of weeks, I could see him take his mind off his work.  Naturally there was a 2nd round in it for me and we had a great evening. =) So ladies, and gentlemen (this can totally apply to us too), if you're intuition suggests that your partner is stressed out, help them out with a special evening and a special massage and you might be able to get a lot of that spark back.","Y'all, quit railing on OP. If you know your partner wouldn't enjoy it or would feel pressured by it, don't do it. But I personally think that this is a sweet story and shows a lot of love and effort. I would LOVE to do this for my husband, but when he has low libido, it's usually because he's super depressed/low self esteem and I know that it would be a trigger for him. However, it's still a nice fantasy, and there's nothing wrong with someone wanting to share it.",869
dct2av,"I just tried it and holy mother of gawd is it bad. The shower floor is slippery from lube, my guy tried to stick it in my ass multiple times, the angle tore my lips, I was getting a minor concussion because of all the head banging against the wall as he frantically tried to ram me from behind... Then not to mention the shower head decided to join as our 3rd and gave me the most hottest facial (literally) and managed to spray the contact out of my eye. 0/10 would recommend, i'm staying to regular ol' cramped car or bed sex. Edit: TIL not to shower with my contacts on lmao. But I'm scared cause I've slipped on the floor before and smacked my head hard cause I'm blind as a bat! Also, I guess I should note that there's a huge height difference between my guy and me. Like more than a foot difference haha. Maybe that makes shower sex even harder?",Shower sex because nothing is as sexy as being waterboarded while you’re trying to fuck.,1896
df7em1,"Hi all!  I'm sure you've all read my posts over the past year now - I'm the guy who had penile cancer and had to have a total penectomy (full removal of my penis). After my ex and I split up, it's been really hit and miss in terms of having an orgasm but I'm getting there with my solo sessions now. I've been with an escort, but that was a couple of months ago.  So I've been dating a lovely woman for the past 5-6 weeks or so - we've been on about 5 dates now and after the last one we decided she was going to come around yesterday evening and spend the night (we've known each other for 2 years previously though). She's also sent me some pictures of her boobs, so I have been turned on all week.  She came around looking fucking STUNNING. I mean seriously, a serious 10/10.  We had lots of fun - she's an inner geek so we played my PS4, watched some films and had some drinks.  After a while, we just started making out. Like really passionately and we decided to go to bed. Now I have had sex since my cancer and my op, but this was so nerve wracking for me as I fancy her so bad. She was also nervous as she's had a sexually abusive ex and hasn't had any in a while.  Let me tell you, it's some of the dirtiest, passionate sex I've ever had! Because I have no penis, I mainly use my fingers, tongue and toys. So the vast majority of our night included oral sex and fingers. I fucked her with my fingers like I would a dick, and we both have each other oral. She came hard from me eating her out, and so did I. In fact I gave her an unexpected facial! It's 50/50 whether I have a dry orgasm or ejaculate usually, we were 69'ing and she was on top, and I was so horny, so aroused my cum just shot out and hit her in the face! She wasn't bothered though, on fact it she found it amazingly erotic.  I feel like the best guy who's ever lived, not only because I had sex with an amazing woman but because I feel like I deserve my bit of happiness! We'll definitely do it again.","You know, I’ll admit, I’ve been stalking you a bit.  Haha. I frequently check to see if you have any updates and I was going to DM you soon. This post has seriously made my fucking day. I’m so ecstatic for you and for your lovely, lovely woman. In a world Often full of bad news, it’s awesome to see something good happen to someone for a change. YAY YOU! Keep having amazing sex!!",650
dfh3bg,"My friend and I are interested in science. We also think that rimjobs are fun to give (me) and receive (her). She does molecular biology and has plenty of experience using lab equipment to examine bacteria and fungal pathogens. The procedure to study how disgusting a given surface is, is pretty straightforward—you’ve probably done this yourself in middle school science class. Using multiple swabs (to get a good average), we tested several surfaces:  -a “clean” kitchen counter  -my dick, her vulva -both of our upper backs -both of our anuses after showering and washing in there with soap.  Greatest amount, and most diverse growths: kitchen counter. Next for some reason was my upper back (I promise I shower...maybe my skin sheds a lot?). After that, our anuses, dicks, and vulva growths looked almost completely identical.","So I should stop kissing my girl's upper back and focus on her ass, thanks science!",7165

diseie,"I have been masturbating for 10 years and sexually active for 2. I always got pleasure from masturbation and sex, it always feels amazing, but I could never quite get there and it was extremely frustrating. I could always feel myself on the edge of something great and then it would just slowly disappear.  Well, my current boyfriend has been very patient and has let me feel very comfortable exploring what feels good with him and what doesnt.

dj6syu,"As you can see in the title - my girlfriend (20f) and I (21m) finally had sex a few weeks ago after more than 5 years of relationship. I‘m trying to keep it as short as possible while also including most relevant info. I‘m usually just a lurker on reddit but made a new account specifically for this topic since I wanted to share our success and my perspective as the boyfriend. Anyways, enough with the disclaimer. My girlfriend and I were both virgins when we met and had no experience whatsoever, and got together when we were 15. After a few months we decided to have sex - which didn’t really work at all. After different problems I figured out I had phimosis, I basically couldn’t retract my foreskin. Tried stretching it out for a few weeks with little success so I decided to get a circumcision. After all that was done and healed we slowly tried having sex again - still couldn’t even fit the tip in. We tried all the usual suggestions from her gynecologist or the Internet: hour long foreplay, lots of lube, different angles, positions, alcohol, weed, anything. At some point we obviously became very frustrated because nothing seemed to work, which is when we realized her having vaginismus. If you aren‘t familiar with it, it basically means the muscles inside/around the vagina cramp up subconsciously when trying to insert anything. We also figured my friend down there is on the bigger side, especially the girth, which didn’t really help our case (trying my best not to sound humblebraggy). So we put trying to have sex on hold, tried to free ourselves from any pressure and wanted to work our way up. Slow and steady. At the beginning only a finger would fit. Then two fingers. After we overcame some doubts we decided to try small dildos. When that would work we slowly went up with sizes. This whole process took a few years - it probably could‘ve went quite a bit faster, but there were times when we felt just really low and unmotivated to keep trying. Eventually we always went back to trying though. Also, while we didn‘t have any PIV (or anal) all those times, we still got each other off regularly with oral and our hands, or with toys. That was the most important part all along and something we had to realize in the beginning - even though we couldn‘t have „traditional“ sex we still both needed intimacy and, well, orgasms. Every few months during that process we would maybe try having penetrative sex again, without success. Also, after a while I needed to take a small dose of Cialis before trying again. I developed some ED (only when we tried having PIV) because over the years it manifested that trying penetration means I risk hurting her, which my penis (literally) couldn’t keep up with. There were times in between were it was super depressing. For me aswell but also for her - even though I kept reassuring her and didn’t put any pressure whatsoever, she still blamed herself at times. Which made me feel helpless and sad because I love this woman more than anything. But we always kept our hope and things always got better after a while. It was also incredibly important to keep the communication up, share our thoughts and listen to each other.  Those last few months went really well though, we got more comfortable with the dildo sizes so a few weeks ago we wanted to try again, after almost a year of not trying PIV. And - it worked!!! We finally had our first time! We have never been so happy and relieved before. We cuddled and talked right after for a long time and there may have been a few tears of joy on both sides. Such a huge weight lifted from our shoulders. Only half of my penis fit comfortably without her having pain, so I still had to concentrate on it not going too deep, but man did it feel good. Even though our relationship has always been great, the feeling that we both worked through darker times and finally had such a success adds a whole new level to us. In the last few weeks we had PIV quite a few times, and while there is still some work ahead of us we both can feel us getting better with every single time.  Oof, this got longer than I anticipated. Sorry. I‘m just still so ecstatic about it and want to spread hope - to anyone facing similar issues. There is hope!!!   TLDR: patience is key in overcoming Vaginismus   Edit: Wow - so much positive feedback already. I appreciate all of you! Thank you for taking time reading this and all the sweet comments. I obviously showed the post and comments to my girlfriend and we both feel flattered. I‘m glad we could give hope to some of you.",That is great. Such dedication to each other. Well done.

dn31xw,"I drove an hour to give my sister “the talk” today, and I’m so glad I did. I could sense her hesitation at the beginning, naturally, no one wants to be lectured on the weird changes w their body. So I actually began with a crash course video about sex and sexuality so we weren’t diving straight into the anatomy bits and after I asked her a few questions about gender roles and stereotyping, all that. I redirected afterwards to sexual assault, sharing a couple experiences of my own and telling her that boys and girls can be abusers and abused.     After that we talked about consent, sexual or otherwise and that our bodies are our own. She listened very intently here, as she had actually been to court bc someone that was close to our family was found to be abusing her. She opened up about it, saying that she understood that what happened wasn’t consensual and that she knows now. We talked about how our partners could still hurt us and how we need to communicate at all times.       Next came stds, and I think this part may have been where I saw the biggest surprise from her. I asked her “are people with stds disgusting? Can they have normal lives? Can they still have sex?” Unsurprisingly, she said “Ew no??” I then told her that I’d been living with herpes for almost a year and was fucking SHOOK. She was so confused. She said “how did you get it??” So I told her briefly about my history, my number of partners, etc. You could tell something kinda clicked. She talked about how she thought that only hoes could get stds. I then told her how to get tested and where to go, and that if you do test positive you’re still a good person and you are still worthy of love. We spoke about the stigma in society about stds and I think she really got it. By the time we did get into the anatomy part she was actively listening and talking. She asked super insightful questions and honestly think this was the perfect time to talk to her! Have any of you given siblings/children the talk? Did you say anything other than what I did? How did it go?? Edit: Thanks for the platinum!! And thank you so much for sharing :) Edit 2: 1k??? Thank you so much, holy shit!!

domaxt,"I (21F) have been having sex with (28M) since June. I’ve been having issues with the comments he makes about my body. Tonight was the worst. When we first started having Sex, he made a disgusted remark about the scars and bruising on my stomach. I just explained that I’m a diabetic and I bruise easily from my injections. I’ve been a diabetic for 10 years so my stomach looks far from flawless.  He’s also made comments about my pubic hair. I like it short and trimmed, my skin is sensitive so shaving it irritates the skin and makes the area red/itchy. I can’t shave it every shower and I always use a new razor for the best shave. He texts me things like “have you shaved that thing for me yet?” Or “shave and come over to sit on my face”  I get people have preferences but I work 60 hours a week and it’s hard to always have the time to do a meticulous shave. Last week he asked me to come over, I was finishing work late and he lives 5 minutes away. I went over to the gym 2 minutes down the street to shower my body, put some lingerie on under my clothes to surprise him and I touched up my hair/makeup. I always try to be as fresh as possible. He texted me saying he was 30 minutes away at his friends and that he was on his way home. I ran a few errands while I was waiting and I waited around for him to text me. He never texted me that night and I ended up waiting 60 minutes for him before I drove home.  The next morning he texted me saying “sorry I passed out”   So as stupid as I am, he invited me over tonight and I went over anyways. We get down to it and he says something “doesn’t look right down there” I ask him what he means and he points to the small scab I got on my thigh from chaffing. Then he points to the spot I nicked myself shaving on the inside of my vagina lip. He tells me it’s “terrible” and I apologize saying I didn’t realize the nick was that bad. He rolls over and shoves his face in the pillow, saying nothing and leaving me there naked and embarrassed. A minute goes by and I start getting dressed, I told him I was embarrassed and he said “when I saw it, I got turned off” and shoved the rest of his face into the pillow. I told him that I “didn’t want to continue having sex” and he muffles to me in the pillow. I ask him to me like an adult and take his face out of the pillow and he responded with “that’s fine”. I leave his apartment and he locks the door behind me.  Am I unreasonable for being upset? I get that it might not have been the prettiest thing to see but I felt like he could have handled it better. Update: To clear things up, this guy was not my bf but merely a guy I was seeing casually. Also, I really want to thank all of you for your kind comments and support, I had no idea this post would blow up so much! I have cut off all contact with him and have no plans on seeing or talking to him. You guys made me realize he was ridiculous and that I should value myself more with my choice in men. Thank you everyone, I’m going to choose to focus on me for now! To everyone who messaged me privately, I would love to reach out to you in the near future. Especially the diabetics who stepped up! You guys are amazing","Did not have to read past first few lines. He is an idiot get rid of him fast. You don’t need people like that in your life.

dqqfoa,"I'm so angry. I had some really great sex on Halloween, we said goodnight, he went home and I went to bed. Went to work the next day all happy, excited to see him again. Went home and hours later I went to pee and after I happened to look down (which I normally dont do when I wipe) and I see a weird white thing sticking out, I pull on it and out pops the fucking condom we used the night before!!  A flood of fear and anger ran through me as I calculated how many hours it was since we had sex. If it had went any longer I could have missed the window to take the plan B and wait however long it is to see if I'm fucking pregnant!!  I sent him an angry text asking why he didn't tell me and that he was paying for half of the plan B. He replied saying he was scared and ""didn't know what to say or how to say it"". The fuck?? Uh maybe just, ""the condom came off sorry, I'll help pay for the emergency contraceptive""???? He said he'd of course help pay for it but hasn't responded since last night to me asking how he was going to give me the money for it. I'm so angry. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE! Pregnancy would fuck my life up worse than it is, I could no way pay for an abortion! I'm also terrified of childbirth so if I couldn't l'd have to suffer through pregnancy and the terror of what it would/can do to my body, just because this fucking child was too scared to be a grown ass adult and take responsibility and own up to a fucking mistake!",We all need to be better.  Really.  Shit like this is unacceptable - especially for adults.,1925
dreymw,"Thankfully, I grew up with amazing parents. Medical field so really open and honest about sex, and healthy habits regarding it. I know to pee after sex. Until one night I didn’t.   My theory is I must’ve just fallen asleep with my boyfriend after, because I’ve always made it a habit to pee after.   Me and my boyfriend live about an hour apart, both still with our parents because broke college students. I was staying at his house for about a week when it started with minor UTI symptoms. Frequent urination, burning stinging feeling when I peed, and only a little coming out at a time. I’ve had a handful of UTIs before and usually they take care of themselves, so his mom just gave me some Azo , my boyfriend kept my water bottle full, and I figured that was it . But then the next day, I couldn’t leave his bed because my lower back was in so much pain. I was shaking because I had the chills so bad.  I finally gave in and called my mom, and she drove the hour to come pick me up. Once home, I immediately get into bed and sleep only to wake up a few hours later covered in sweat, still in pain, and running to the bathroom to throw up. I wake my parents and my mom drives me to her hospital.  I’m admitted immediately, and long story short: I’m in septic shock. For those that are unfamiliar, septic shock is when bacteria gets into the bloodstream, and your organs start shutting down. My blood pressure wouldn’t raise, my heart rate wouldn’t slow down, my fever wouldn’t go away, and they’re about 6 litres in on my IV . But I’m still not peeing because my kidneys aren’t working , so I’m swelling with all the extra fluid in me .  I’m transferred to the ICU where I have 24 hour care, and (I learned later) they were genuinely fearing for my life . I was too in and out of consciousness to really understand how bad of a situation this was .  IV medications aren’t working , so we need to have a central line (PICC) put in , which is an IV to my heart .  I’m still not peeing (it’s been a few days now) , and the fluid is settling into my lungs so now my oxygen levels are so low that i need a breathing mask. My doctors administer Lasix through the PICC, which is a medication that essentially flushes the body, like a diuretic. This FINALLY works and my catheter is getting put to gallons worth of good work.  I’m probably missing a lot of details, as I mentioned I wasn’t conscious for a lot of this. But I stayed in the hospital almost two weeks. I had friends visit, and I don’t even remember them visiting.  Recovery included having to restrengthen my lungs with a spirometer, this machine thing that you breathe in and out of to exercise your breathing strength (bad explanation but), needing my parents help just to get out of bed, and almost passing out just walking to the bathroom.  So PLEASE, please always pee after sex . UTIs suck , getting out of a warm comfy bed sucks , but almost dying and drowning in your own lungs sucks 100x more .  You never think it’ll happen to you, until it does. So please use this as your wake up call to never forget to pee after sex. Edit : I’m getting lots of common questions and stuff so here’s some basic replies !  Yes this can happen to guys too, although women are more susceptible .  Condoms don’t prevent UTIs as bacteria from sweat, hands, etc can still come into contact with your genitals . This whole ordeal happened about 5 months ago so I’m back to normal now , but thank you for all the well wishes anyway !!  And everybody’s body has different vulnerabilities to things like infection, so if you’re someone who never pees after and has never had a UTI: awesome ! But personally I think peeing takes less than three minutes, so why play with fire? Also , yes , lower back pain is the first sign the infection has travelled , so take your butt to the doctor . Don’t do what I did . That’s the point of this post . Edit 2 : omg thanks for the awards !!!! First gold and silver !!!! Woohoo !!!!","Azo simply numbs the urinary tract. It can be used in a pinch until you get on antibiotics but no one should assume they can flush out a UTI with plenty of water. Taking azo for more than a few days can cause kidney damage as well. I tell patients it is good for the first 24-48 hrs while you’re on meds as it typically takes that long on antibiotics until the pain and urgency resolved. Moral of the story...if you have symptoms of a uti, call your dr then. Take azo only to help manage your symptoms while you start antibiotic treatment. -Primary Care Physician",2207
dtkntc,"As a rule I avouid eye contact when and where possible, it feels horribly exposing and makes me feel deeply uncomfortable. However, yesterday my partner and I were having sex and in the spur of the moment I pulled her to the edge of the bed so I can stand and get better leverage- during the process I accidentally made eye contact and almost got lost in her eyes, and our gazes were locked as we both came. I've not been able to stop thinking about it, for a split second I felt like I could feel the planet turning and hurtling through space. It was shockingly profound. This isnt meant as a humblebrag or anything, I've tried to tell her how I felt but don't seem able to make her understand- I just had to tell someone in the hope I could make them get it. EDIT= Ok, posting something slightly drunk and come back to find that its resonated with a lot of people was a very unexpected but pleasant surprise.  Feel the need to address a couple of points made in the comments, yes I'm aware my issue with eye contact is not a healthy sign- I've got some hang ups from a difficult childhood but I'm getting help and am making great progress. The other was people expressing incredulity that I can find eye contact more intimate than ""dicking someone down"", others tried to explain it but I'll see if I can add to the explanations. According to my therapist my issue is that on a subconscious level I'm afraid that when I make eye contact I get worried that the other person can see my past and the effect its had on how it makes me feel about myself.  Thinking about it that way then it becomes an issue of physical intimacy compared to emotional intimacy- the second is much much harder than the first especially if you're a bit messed up. Physical intimacy is a matter of proximity, you follow your instincts and to stop you physically move away. To stop emotional intimacy it just takes a thought, maybe you close yourself off a bit or dont share as much, maybe you lie or change the subject when they ask what youre thinking or why you seem sad and sometimes you might not even be aware you've done so.",Eye contact is vastly underrated,1720
dvixqp,"He was always a healthy weight and fit, but 4 months ago he joined a gym and goes 3 times a week.  Oh. My. Lord. The abs. The chest. The shoulders. The biceps. His thighs. I can't get over how HOT I find him now he's a bit more muscular. I'm constantly horny and trying to touch him. I love how it feels when he's on top and I'm surrounded by his hard chest and strong arms.  It's also made me really determined to get more in shape myself - maybe it will have the same effect on him! Has anyone else had their partner get fit and found their own sex drive increase? Or the other way round? EDIT - thank you for the silver, kind redditor!  And in response to various questions that have been asked a few times: - Yes he was very fit and a healthy weight before, but he had a leaner physique - now he's more muscular. But he's not suddenly turned into a body builder, just bulked up a little.  - No he's not on steroids (where does that idea even come from?!?). He's very into eating wholefoods and won't even take paracetemol, I'm certain he's not taking anything else!  - Yes I'm going to make sure I start doing some resistance / body weight excercises as well as cardio, but thank you for the advice - I'm a bit overweight, I want to get leaner and stronger, and I am not experienced at excercise / working out, so I have appreciated the views on this. - We've been together 17 years, I'm not worried him going to the gym means we'll break up - if anything the fact I find him even more irresistible has been good for our marriage! I'm sorry to hear about the (many!) breakups on this thread, but I suspect there might have been deeper issues in many of those relationships than just one partner getting fitter. May you all find partners who want you to be your best self! :) EDIT 2 - thank you for the gold! And just because some people are missing it in the comments - he's not turned into a bodybuilder over 4 months, and he's not on steroids (some folks obsessed with this idea, apparently - who knew!). He was very fit before, but mainly did endurance running. Going to the gym has changed his body, probably only a little but I notice it a lot cos I know his body as well as my own.  Love reading about all the other people who have had a similar thing happen in their relationships :) May your health, fitness and sexy times continue!",I tried this in the hope that my wife would find it super hot as you do in the hopes that she would desire me more and improve our sex life.

dxpmuf,"my roommate (21M) and i (21F) have been getting very steamy with one another recently (i honestly think he wants to be exclusive with me, but that’s not important rn), and he’s VERY kinky. backtracking a little, i’ve only ever had a couple serious relationships in the past and most of the sex i’ve had is very vanilla, and i’ve had to be the one to bring kinkiness to the table. but y’all, i’ve now had my shit rocked. so yesterday we were having sex in my living room and he picked me up and sat me down on the arm of the couch. he grabbed me by my hair and said “watch me fuck you,” and i couldn’t believe how hot it made me. i, for the first time, had a vaginal orgasm that didn’t involve the clit at all. i told him afterward that it was the most intense sex i’d ever had, and he told me that that was just the tip of the iceberg. i’m so excited to keep doing this with him, i finally feel like my sexual fantasies are being fulfilled.","You had me at ""y'all, I've now had my shit rocked""",1234
dzvbh7,"So 2 weeks ago I matched with this guy on tinder and I invite him to my dorm room. He comes, he cums, I cum, everything’s great.  So I invite him over again. He arrives. He starts fingering me and shits getting wet and wild. It’s just as rough as last time, how I like it. We switch and I start sucking his dick. Ass up, face down.  All of sudden the loudest, longest blast of trapped air releases itself from my vagina like a fucking balloon deflating. I am in shock, he is too. I spit out his dick and try desperately to explain which hole it actually came from. He starts laughing. I laugh along trying to salvage this hookup and my dignity. When he stops laughing he SAYS HE CANT DO IT ANYMORE and he has to HEAD OUT. He leaves faster than I could put my pants back on. He hadn’t even been there for 10 minutes.   The worst part is he goes to my school and I’ve seen him around before. I wish for death.  Edit: thanks for everyone’s kind words.

e12fdf,"My wife and I have been together since high school. We were each other’s firsts and had a sex life that was satisfying for both of us, but then we had a baby girl. Things slowed after and around our child’s 1st birthday I began getting frustrated. I was working ridiculous hours and coming home to a chaotic new home life. My wife had no sex drive from being home always with the baby, and was nervous about PIV due to some small delivery complications.  PIV was completely off the table, and even getting a blowjob or handjob felt like a chore and honestly felt I was pressuring her every time. She didn’t want to be touched and I felt selfish.  I never wanted to separate or divorce, but I didn’t want things to stay this way. So, after some conversations about how this was impacting our marriage, she talked to her doctor who recommended going off birth control.  So, about three months ago, my wife went off birth control. She was a little more emotional, but then one day last month she said “I’m starting to have a sex drive again.”   A week ago she said “I want you inside me tonight.”  And last night after our son was down she sat down on my lap, kissed me deeply, and moaned while asking me to come upstairs and fuck her. When I did she came for the first time in what feels like years and both of us are over the moon.  I say this because I read so many problems and how the advice a lot of times is “leave” or “find someone who will satisfy you” and I just want to remind people that sometimes being patient and talking about these things can work too.",Do you think this is due to the birth control?? I feel as though I have a low sex drive and am also on birth control,1096
e1hzzz,"I stayed with my ex for 6(!) years. We got together when we were teenagers and stayed together until adulthood. I thought he was the one. But I felt bad, because I had no sex drive anymore, and had to force myself to have sex with him to keep our relationship alive.I had multiple UTIs, and sex was often painful, but I thought maybe I'm just unlucky, maybe this is normal. I never blamed him. I want to share my experience with young girls and women who don't know better. My ex, K, was completely my type, I found him incredibly attractive, and in the beginning, I always wanted to have sex with him. I was your typical horny teenager after all. K was quite rough and didn't particularly enjoy foreplay. His idea of sex was to do a jackhammer type of motion all throughout. At first it was fine. It felt kinky, ""bad"".I agreed with him when he said, we don't want to make love, we want to fuck. He convinced me purely ""fucking"" was much hotter.Often after sex I would have problems sitting because this vigorous style of fucking, without any prep or foreplay, made my genitals super swollen and painful. But I was 16 and didn't think it might be abnormal.He would often bump into my cervix and it would be painful, I would wince and tell him it hurt, but it turned him on, and he would only stop for a short bit until he started again. K insisted that I was always completely shaven because he found pubic hair disgusting. I grew really painful razor burns, but it seemed like hair was still more disgusting than red bumps and cuts on my privates because he would never fail to point out when I hadn't shaven ""I said I want NO hair"". I don't know why I thought it was okay for him to dictate what to do with my body. I was young. I didn't know better. He also shaves, I thought, so he must have the right to ask me to do the same? K had zero interest in my sexual pleasure unless it made him feel good about his sexual prowess. He wanted me to moan and be loud, but he never took the time to find out what exactly would get me off. Actually, in 6 years, he never made me cum once. And that never bothered him. I thought, ""I must be one of those girls who can't cum"".K very rarely went down on me, but he made it so clear he didn't like it, that I couldn't enjoy it myself. I, on the other end, went down on him a lot. I enjoyed it for the most part, but K would insist I deep throat him, even though he was quite above average, and there was no way I could fit it all in my mouth. He thought it was really hot when I gagged or got teary eyed, and generally got very aroused by any signs of discomfort I'd get from going down on him. One day I got mad at him insisting I push through when I felt very nauseous, and I asked him how he would feel if I actually vomited from giving him a blow job. He was genuinely turned on by the idea. One of the worst things about my sex life with K is that he made me feel bad about getting wet. Yes, you read that right. I felt bad if I got too wet because then he couldn't feel things as much anymore. It didn't matter that it meant sex was more comfortable for me. And that having dry sex would cause multiple bouts of painful UTIs.I feel so stupid now.This is a stigma that stayed with me, and once I had sex with another guy, andhe told me he enjoyed me being so wet I thought he was just being nice, and then I wiped the moisture away the first chance I got. Said guy was so weirded out that I was suddenly dry, he thought I wasn't enjoying myself and lost his erection... Girls, this is not what sex is supposed to be! I only found that out when I was 24 and met my current SO! My bf is so attentive, he saves posts on reddit how to give amazing head, he observes my reactions and will litteraly take care of me for an hour and enjoy it... He bought me my first sex toy thanks to which I got my first orgasm (I CAN cum after all!!).He loves it when I'm wet and when us having sex makes wet noises. He makes me feel hot whether or not I have pubic hair. he doesn't care if I'm on my period or if I'm sweaty from working out.It's the most amazing feeling. And we make love. Yes, sometimes we have a quickie that's really just about relieving our urges; but often we have long, attentive sex, we care about making each other feel amazing, he whispers sweet things in my ear, calls me beautiful, and it's the sexiest thing ever. I've never been so turned on by anyone ever and it's been 3 years, and every weekend we have sex 3-4 times still...I'm so thankful for him and can't believe there used to be a day where I thought I wouldn't mind never having sex again. Ladies, sometimes it's not you, it's him! Sex is supposed to be enjoyable. Amazing, even. Take care ♥ &#x200B; Edit: wow, I can't believe thousands of people actually read my post! I'm so happy if sharing my story has helped someone. Also thanks for the awards!     Edit 2: Some people seem to have understood that my boyfriend goes down on me when I'm on my period. He doesn't, and I don't think it's fair to expect that from anyone. I just meant we still have sex when I'm on my period.","This is what happens when a man learns everything he knows about sex from bad porn.

Props to you OP for dumping a piece of shit. You deserve a lover, not someone who only views you as a tool for his own pleasure. Pieces of shit like him make the rest of us look bad.

e3ewzc,"My son has been dating this really nice sweet girl for 3 months and they sometimes have sleepovers in his room. I'm pretty sure they've had sex already or at least experimented together. I have always told him that he can do his private business with her in his room. I've told him that he can bring her when he's home alone or pretty much any other time but for the love of all that's holy, that they use protection. I discreetly gave him a pack the first time she stayed. He's pretty level headed and understands this so in general I trust him to have safe sex, if they are having it. But, her parents seem really conservative. I have met them a few times in school events and the mom is veeeery Christian, and the dad told us to ""keep an eye on them"" while jokingly elbowing my husband. So, you see, this is where I get a little confused. I'm not gonna hide in the fucking air ducts and verify that they are not going too far in their sexual experimentation. Like, WTF, they are 17, if they are horny they're gonna drive to the end of the world to bang in a dingy kombi. It seems better to just give them a safe place to have safe, stress-free sex than to hover over their heads. I think it kinda diffuses the rebellious side of sex and just lets them be. My husband agrees with me in that we are not gonna stop them from spending the night together, that just seems like the kind of thing that drives teens into unsafe sex who knows where. But, if her parents find out there could be some drama that we knowingly let her princess sin under our roof or whatever. So, what do parents do in these cases? What would you do? Honestly, I'm all for lying through my teeth about separating them at night if they ask, and if they somehow find out they're sleeping together then whatever the fuck ever, we'll deal with it, they're not gonna sue us over it. But also, I can see that a lot of people would not agree with me and want do kind of a reality check to see if I'm a little too extreme? Am I? What's the best way to handle it?","If her parents are allowing her to sleep over at her boyfriend’s house, they can’t be THAT stupid.

e811wg,"I posted this as a comment and it was received well so I thought I would make a thread so people could add their own ideas! What are ways you can softly dominate a man? For those of us interested in power dynamics (especially the woman being in charge) but aren’t interested in a lot of sadomasochism or humiliation.   1. Wear a skirt or dress w no panties. Stop and kiss him. Put your hands on his shoulders to indicate he should stay where he’s standing. Mosey on over to a couch, bed, or chair and be very flirty about it. Sit down, give him a sweet smile and say “can you get on your knees for me?” He’ll either immediately comply or look at you confused. If he’s confused ask him if he wants your attention, he’ll probably say yes. When he’s on his knees do the “come here” motion finger and open your legs at the same time so he can see you aren’t wearing panties. From here he should crawl toward you. Tell him something like “You’re not getting anything until you make me come.”  2. Pin him down. He’s probably way stronger than you so you aren’t actually pinning him, but a part of the fun is him pretending you are strong enough. It’s dominating but also cute bc it’s silly.  3. Sit on his face and be a little more aggressive w your dirty talk. Instead of “don’t stop, please don’t stop,” say “don’t stop, don’t you FUCKING stop” 4.  Do things as you normally would just be bossy. Don’t pull his shirt off, TELL HIM to take his shirt off. TELL HIM to take your clothes off. TELL HIM to go lay on the bed and wait for you. TELL HIM to change positions.  5. Pull his face deeper when he’s going down on you.  6. Make him beg a little. Next time he tries to go down on you, close your legs and make him say please. Make him tell you he wants it. 7. When your blowing him, if he asks to fuck you look at him like he’s lost his mind and say something like “you’re not in charge here” and go back to blowing him. 8. Blow him and make him keep his hands behind his head. If he moves his hands stop blowing him.  9. Give him a lap dance but tell him absolutely no touching or it stops.  10. When your away from each other during the day, text him the things you want him to do to you later.",I want my wife to do all of this to me so badly,576
e8ljjh,"So like a woman I've been seeing is super into feminine guys which I'm happy to oblige. She said she wanted to use a vibrator on me. I'm like, fuck it go ahead. So there I am on my back with her pressing the head of a vibe under the tip of my dick. It feels fucking amazing btw, give that shit a try. Anyway I guess she knows me well enough to tell when I'm a second away from finishing because she keeps pulling the vibrator away an instant too early. She does this for like 10 mins and im goin goddamn insane. Finally even after she pulls it away again, I guess my nards couldn't take it anymore because I still nutted. HOWEVER, I literally didn't feel any kind of orgasm. It just came out. Then she puts the vibrator back in place. Against everything I know about male biology, I immediately feel like I'm about to cum despite having just nutted, but it still fuckin happened. An orgasm like any other, but nothing came out. And then my dick kept trying to make it happen but there was nothing left man, it just kept happening, I have to have had literally like 20+ orgasms inside of as many seconds. Like a fuckin positive feedback loop of my dick not figuring out why it wasn't working and turning itself off and on again. She finally stopped after I basically lost conciousness.

e9n0z5,"I (female) watched a lot of porn this week, because well I was horny.  But every time the fake moaning, the screaming and the 'oh shit oh fuck omgooooddd yes yes yes' is annoying the hell out of me. Even in so called amateur porn (which often is semi-professional) i think women overdo it because they feel like they are expected to behave like this.  It is fine if this is natural for you to do but not if it is acted and fake.  Anybody agree with me ?

Kissa Sins does that a lot. Edit 2: my problem with finding nice amateur or homemade stuff is that either the angles and lightning are not so good or the woman has copied the behaviour of the lound moaning screaming professional porn actress.

ebl3o2,"Hello, So my girlfriend has a gangbang fantasy. I would love to fulfill it for her; however, we are not to the point yet where we are comfortable introducing other guys yet. &#x200B; I tried something while on vacation with her that she seemed to enjoy. I tied her up on a bed and fucked her for a bit. I then got up and yelled, ""NEXT!"" and went outside the room and shut the door. I came back a few moments later and fucked her again, but I tried to do it in a different style to seem like I was a different man. I did this over and over again several times until she came. Now, I want to take it a few steps further. I have an idea of spaying different colognes on multiple different shirts (3-4) and also having some audio in the background (men talking, cheering). The plan is to tie her up again and blindfold her and then fuck her for a bit. Then leave the room and come back wearing a different smelling shirt. Since she will be tied up and blindfolded, she will only be able to smell and hear me. Hopefully, she will think it is a different guy based on the smell of the t-shirt. We also have a suction-cup dildo that I can use on her while having sex. Has anyone here ever tried anything like this before? If so, did it go as planned, any tips? What else could I do to make it seem like there are more guys in the room with us? Thanks! &#x200B; \~\~ \*Edit I wanted to post an update to respond to some of these comments. I am super pleased to see how welcome the idea is. I came up with the idea a few weeks ago and brought it up to her then. She loved the idea and is 100% onboard. I love that I can share these ideas with her and not feel judged. I didn't expect to get this much feedback on this; some of these suggestions are amazing! I think I will look into the different cock sleeves to work with different sizes, excellent idea. I did like the idea of fake cum as well. I think I will make a fake homemade version and keep it warm with a bowl of hot water by the bed. Might use a plastic pump bottle so I can shoot a few ropes onto her after each 'guy' is done. As for the couple of negative comments, different strokes for different folks I guess. &#x200B; &#x200B; # !!UPDATE!! I am unable to make a new post for this per /r/sex rules, so I am adding a comment to this instead. Well, I am sure that some of you have been wanting an update on this. We enjoyed all of your comments on the last post, which made us excited to try out some of the suggestions. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I found a post on /r/sex that had a daily sex challenge for June. I grabbed the content and sent it over to her; she looked over the list and happily agreed. The challenge has a list of different sexual activities & positions each day.  One of the items on the list was ""Roleplay Fantasy,"" which raised my eyebrows. Following some suggestions for the 'Gangbang,' I went online and purchased a 'Fuck Machine' as well as some Jizzed themed lube. Both items were shipped quickly and were here within a few days. When the machine arrived, I plugged it in and laughed and giggled with anticipation. On the morning of the challenge, I told her that I had some friends showing up around 7:30 tonight to hang out. She knew this to be false since we are still working from home and currently social distancing. She shot me a quick smile and said that it ""Sounds fun, I hope you guys have a great time!"". At this point, we both knew that today would be the day. The rest of the day, she asked innocent questions like, ""What are you guys doing when they come to hang out?"" or ""How many friends do you have showing up tonight?"". I kept all of my responses short, not trying to break character or act like anything out of the ordinary was about to happen. Shortly before 7:30, I started to set up the room.  The plan was to have her blindfolded, but I wanted her to be still able to hear. I put on a sexy playlist I found on Spotify and turned on a box fan for some white noise. I found gangbang porn, put it on my phone, set the phone on the dresser, and turned up the volume. I wanted her to think the room was full of guys waiting for their turn. I started a teapot of hot water and waited for that to get warm. I put the warm water into a pot and placed the bottle of lube inside. I wanted the lube to get to body temperature so that when the men 'came,' it would still feel real. Next, I took three t-shirts outside and shot each one with a spray of a different cologne. I folded the shirts onto themselves, making sure not to mix the scents. I then brought everything into the bedroom and set up the machine. I also laid out two other dildos to simulate the other two men that were supposed to be joining us. During this time, she was taking a shower and getting dressed. When she came out, my jaw hit the floor. She had on these tight fishnets and this little skimpy skirt that hugged her ass perfectly. Her hair and makeup looked great, and I could tell that she was excited. She looked exactly like I imagined if we were to do this for real. I put a blindfold on her and lead her to the bedroom. I brought her inside and placed my hand on her throat. I told her that I mentioned to my 'friends' about our little 'fantasy"" and said that they would be willing to ""help us out."" I pushed her down to the floor, and then my friends and I started to 'use' her. &#x200B; ... ... ... &#x200B; After all of the events were over, we laid down and talked. I asked her what she liked and what could be approved. She said that she loved it and that it was super fun. I started to ask for more detail on which aspects she enjoyed or even noticed. &#x200B; * **Cologne:** She could tell that I used different scents and that it helped with the immersion. * **Audio:** She said that this was a good idea and that it seemed like a group of men were at a party. * **Fuck Machine:** She liked this a lot, and I am pretty sure we will be using this more in the future. She liked that I was able to change the speed on it to simulate different guys fucking her. * **Heated Lube:** She admitted that she didn't notice the temperature on this. I expected that since she did not know that I was pre-warming that anyways. However, I feel that if the lube were still cold, it would have ruined her immersion a bit. So I take it as a win that she didn't notice. &#x200B; Items that she asked to be different in future attempts. &#x200B; * She wants more vocalized orgasms coming from the guys.  She wants more ""I'm cumming!"" when I spray the lube on her to simulate ejaculation. * She also wanted more ass/anal play when the machine was fucking her. I skipped that this time because I didn't want her to feel too overwhelmed, and ass play is not something that we do too often. &#x200B; All in all, it went very well! Both of us had a ton of fun and will be doing this again in the future. I want to thank the community for all of their suggestions and kind words. It was great to read through all of your responses and helped shape the experience! &#x200B; Thank you all again! ",That's dedication! Seems like you've definitely figured out how to create the next best thing to a real one at the least. Cheers,2811
ecfqsu,"Writing this on a throwaway account because I could get fired for what I did. I work at a store that deals with technology. I won’t be specific, but it’s a pretty big store, and a family store with things for kids to play with and little classes for them. We do sales and repairs, so we’re pretty full-service and often busy and crowded. The other day, I was approached by a coworker with a question about the parental controls on a device. I’m one of the people who is very familiar with software and interfaces, and parental controls are one of my knowledge points that a lot of the younger workers aren’t familiar with (even though I’m not a parent myself), so this wasn’t unusual. The questions centered around removing them. My coworker asked if I could take over, and I said okay. This was all very normal, right up until he said “It’s this old guy. He wants to watch porn.” That got the requisite “WTF” look from me, and my coworker stifled a laugh. “Thanks for dealing with it,” he said. I kind of shrugged. I mean, I like porn, I’m not shy about browsing it, and that people have “needs”. I had no problem handling it, though I bet other coworkers might say I should just send him to a manager to get “politely declined service for that subject.” He takes me over, and introduces me to this very old man. He looked like he might have had Parkinson’s, with the tremor in his hand. His iPad was also very old, as was the software on it. I could tell at a glance that his system had a version from before 2013 (because I’m a nerd who can tell these things at a glance). His iPad would not even be compatible with newer systems. The old man didn’t say anything about porn, but he said that his grandkids had been over, and he thought they did something to his iPad, because it wasn’t working like normal. He said he thought that they’d set some parental controls “to block stuff so kids can’t see it”. I smiled, and sighed, and began to tell him the usual speech about how parental controls work, and how we’d need the passcode if one was set up, and if he didn’t have it, it would require deleting the device and beginning without a backup to get things working again. His iPad didn’t appear to have much on it. But when I got to the settings, I was surprised to find there were no parental controls turned on. I stopped, and I let him know that it appeared there were no controls or limits set. I turned them on and off just in case. I had to ask him. “So what wasn’t working?” I was starting to worry it might be a software incompatibility due to new web standards, and that his old iPad might not be able to be updated to match them. Internally, I did not want to have that conversation. People his age were often on fixed incomes, and could not afford to get a new device. He began trembling again. “I’m 93,” he said. “My wife died. I have nothing left. And the...the videos I’d watch, they aren’t working anymore.” He took the iPad and started to go to a webpage. “I go to xnxx, and the images are there, but when I...” I stopped him. “Sir, uh, our WiFi blocks that,” I said. I remembered using that site myself. It was one of the regular sites I’d used to go to for many years. He nodded and closed his eyes. “Please, I don’t have anyone. I just...need something.” I was struck. It stopped being funny. He was so fucking lonely, and the videos he watched online were important to him. I could see in his eyes, it was something he needed, to just keep existing. And I could see just how ashamed he was to come in, with such a subject and a need, but his loneliness was too much for his shame. He was practically in tears. I acted like what I did next was a big decision, because I thought I had to put up the act, even though it was a quick decision for me. I pulled out my phone, and I turned on the hotspot, and I put his iPad onto my phone’s WiFi. This would bypass the content restrictions our WiFi had. He thankfully had a cover on the iPad. I held it at a low angle, and positioned it so we could see but hopefully there’d be as little a chance for anyone else to see. I typed in xnxx. The porn site came up, and I kept furtively looking over my shoulder. He said “This is how it comes up, but when you tap, it doesn’t play anything...”. So I tapped. While the page changed, I remembered to turn down the volume, and I did. The video came up and started playing. A-okay, no problem. He began to say it wouldn’t do that at home, but still started thanking me. Still, I wasn’t satisfied. If there’s a bug, and it works sometimes but not others, it’s not fixed, it’s just a clue to find it. I tried other videos and they all worked. I closed the webpage and the iPad. He looked so thankful. I told him I didn’t do anything, so I wasn’t sure it was “fixed.” I considered that maybe his kids, the grandkids parents had put parental blocks up on his own ISP, but they’d block the entire site, not the vids. I told him to try it again at home. I didn’t know why it hadn’t worked, but at least we’d proven that his iPad could play them. He left, and even as I told him that I wasn’t sure we could help further he kept thanking me. I just stood there for a moment, and then I started tearing up and had to leave the sales floor. It struck me how lonely he was, how the porn was one of his only ways of just having moments of satisfaction. I felt that hard. I’m serially single. I’m very lonely, and porn is my escape, and I’m just 42. I realized the state he was in, that’s something that is likely coming. For all of us. I know that a lot of my coworkers would laugh at the guy, the pervert coming in, needing his porn. But I felt sad. Sad for him. Sad for all of us. I know that loneliness. It’s waiting for us all. I don’t know if there’s a moral here. I just thought I should share. And please, I know porn is something we laugh about and make fun of, and it’s deserving of that. But sometimes...let’s take away the shame of it. You’re lucky if you don’t need it to get those little moments. Don’t take it for granted. And allow whatever moments others have, however they get them, without shame or looking down. EDIT: I want to thank you all giving me compliments and sharing your experiences as well.  It warms my heart to see that love. I also appreciate the guilding...but if I were honest, please take the little bit of money that goes to these internet medals, and give it to charities that support the elderly or forgotten.   Or better yet, please give a couple of hours of your time.  Time is the most valuable resource we have.  We think it’s unlimited, but it’s very, very limited.  Giving the gift of your time to someone is the most valuable thing you can. Thank you again.",Thank you for treating another human with dignity,4159
ed64wq,"There's probably some guy out there that needs to hear this, so here it goes I started dating my love about 7 or 8 months ago. We had sex for the first time on after our third date (apparently that's local custom haha), and it was very nice. She didn't cum. A week later, when we were fooling around before our second time, she explained something to me: no man has ever made her cum. (no woman either, she doesn't bang women). In fact, up to that point no man had even tried very hard, but even the ones that had didn't get close. Now like any self respecting man, I already considered it my mission to make her cum, but upon hearing this it became my duty.  Being an avid redditer, I knew that the best way towards that end was my tongue. A string of selfish lovers, however, had left my partner with the opinion that she doesn't actually like someone licking her down there. I convinced her to let me try, and honestly, SHE LOVED IT! But she didn't cum. No worries, I'll keep trying and eventually she'll cum with me. We kept having sex, and she didn't always let me lick her but sometimes she did, and she still never came. Even though she was constantly telling me it was the best sex she's had in her life, I thought it couldn't be that good if she's not cumming. The first time she came with me was a couple months in. I got her to put her vibrator on her clit while I was banging her, and we went at it for ages. I had to stop myself from cumming a handful of times, but she got there! It was fucking amazing! I thought, yes, finally we can do it! We'll be able to get there nearly every time now! That's not how it played out though. We weren't able to get there every time. We weren't even able to get there half the time. We had a string of about 3 weeks after that first orgasm where I did everything I could to get her there, including lots of oral and dick+vibe combo, and she wasn't cumming. And she wasn't upset about it, not once at any time up to this point did she express to me that she was disappointed in anything I was doing - to the contrary, she was constantly telling me I was the most attentive least selfish lover she had had. And, being a man, it wasn't good enough for me. She wasn't cumming, and this was my fault. So one time, we're banging, I'm doing everything I can to get her there, she's clearly enjoying it but, like normal, at the end I cum and she still hasn't. And she says this to me: ""wow! I think that's the best sex I ever had!"" I said ""really? But you didn't even cum"" This sparked off one of the top 5 most tense moments in our relationship. She got upset, arguing that I was invalidating her pleasure and her experience. And... even though I just thought I worded it as a simple question, I could see how I was.  We got over it, and we kept banging, but she expressed to me that that comment had actually made her ultra conscious of cumming, and she was going to find it even harder than she had before to cum with me. This lasted for probably 5 weeks: 5 weeks of me trying to please her, accepting that she wasn't going to cum, and *still just enjoying the experience with her and accepting her pleasure despite no orgasm*. That's how long it took for my little comment about her not cumming to wear off, for the pressure to cum to stop being a burden on her. And then, one night, she came with me again!  Now, months later, we're madly in love, and she still doesn't cum most of the time. And that's ok. It's gotta be ok. If it wasn't ok with me, neither of us would be able to have a good time, because... that's just how her body is. But I still try every time, I give her all the smooches and cuddles and rubs and licks, and I fuck her real hard, and usually she doesn't cum but still she loves it. And for us, thats what matters. Cumming is nice, but it isn't everything, it isn't the entire point for her, and if I hadn't learned to accept that, ironically she'd never cum with me at all. Tldr; if you're a bloke with a girl who struggles to cum, DO put in effort, but DON'T pressure her to cum, beat up yourself if she doesn't cum, or invalidate her pleasure because she hasn't cum. You're just going to make it harder for yourself and less enjoyable for the both of you.","Thank you! I'm in the same boat as your partner, I have a lot of trouble coming. I can tell if my bf wants me to come, its instantly 20× harder to come because now I'm trying to do it for him, which is the opposite of what an orgasm actually is.",1412
egpm14,"I was reading an article about how the amount of sex serious couples are having is declining. One dude commented on it as one of the reasons being one partner  ""always says no."" And, this sparked me to respond with a number of reasons why someone might always/often decline sex with their partner. I have in real life heard people complaining about it almost stupidly unaware of their own hand in being turned down. Of course, there are also many reasons that don't have to do with one's partner. So, for any people who are disappointed by being turned down often by their partners, I am listing a bunch of reasons I've had in relationships, some of my partners have had for saying no to me or previous partners, and  some close friends have told me about. I hope people will add other reasons or maybe learn about possible issues with their partners that they could either communicate about or help with. Here's my list (sorry, I'm quite verbose-but you can skip the explanations and just read the listed reasons): **1. Partner is overworked and exhausted.** \-More than once, I have heard people complain that their partner never wants sex without at all understanding that both are working full-time but the partner is doing most of the work at home, cooking, cleaning, taking care of kids while the one who complains about lack of sex works, comes home, and mostly rests. Of course the one who rested for 3 or 4 hours after work has energy and desire. The other one spent 8 hours working, time commuting, and then 4+ hours on their feet at home, just wants to go to sleep. **2. Sex within that relationship causes a lot of anxiety that takes away from pleasure.** \-My ex-husband liked to think of himself as a good lover because he had always wanted his partners to finish and claimed it was important to him. However, he was not willing to do little things I needed and if I didn't finish he'd get mad, be all negative, and it was so upsetting, that it was less and less likely to happen as I would literally be begging myself to finish (inside my head) to avoid an argument after sex. This mindset made finishing more and more challenging for me. He still maintained he was a good lover because he wanted me to finish. He would not believe me when I tried to talk about the issue. I literally didn't finish once in the last 5 months of our relationship. **3. Partner is drunk or high and/or stinky and in need of a shower.** \-Again, my ex-husband. He would come home totally drunk stinking like beer and cigarettes. It was pretty gross. I would have to decide to say yes or no. Yes meant having sex with my head-turned to the side because of how badly he stunk. Needless to say, it wasn't a turn-on for me, nor was it enjoyable for me. It also meant that after he finished he'd berate me for having sex when I really didn't want to. No, would make him get angry and ask why he bothered to come home (even though he was already 6 hours later than he said he'd be.) \-Another instance with someone else, they were sweaty and quite funky smelling despite having showered a few hours before. And, too sensitive to be asked to go shower. It was easier to say no than hurt his feelings asking him to shower. **4. Being asked in the wrong moment and taking a sincere ""not right this second"" as a blanket ""no.""** \-Some people have this notion that sex has to always be spontaneous. It can be fun at times, but as adults with responsibilities there are moments that don't work becuase there is some task at hand and if not done, will be on one's mind during sex causing sex to be less satisfying. An example shared with me by a friend was when in the middle of cooking dinner after a long day at work, her husband came up behind her, put his arms around her, kissed her neck, and it was clear he was ready to go. She needed 15 minutes to finish dinner and when she stated that, her partner got offended, walked away, said she never wants to have sex, and didn't get any that night. She explained to me that if she just turned off the burners, the food would have been ruined and during sex she'd be thinking about how she'd have to figure out something else to cook and was just too annoyed and tired to spend 1 hour cooking for it to go to waste and then spend another hour after her 8 hour workday. Her husband saw no fault with his approach. If he waited 15 minutes rather than wanting to go right in that second because he got a hard-on, they would have had sex and then eaten dinner a bit cold. **5. Partner's body has been made fun of and they are not comfortable being naked.** I've heard stories from multiple friends about this. Saggy breasts, ""too long"" labia, overly loose vagina after childbirth, etc.. are hard to forget when a partner wants sex. One of my friends no longer wanted to be braless in front of her husband. Another stopped enjoying oral sex because of the comments about her labia. Another began to feel seen as asexual once she became a mom by the comments her husband made about the changes in her body. Oddly, none of their partners had any clue their comments were so hurtful and replayed over and over again in the minds of these women. I had another friend who stupidly made her boyfriend feel small as revenge for suspected cheating. He likely cheated, they broke up, she had a sexual relationship with another guy, then when she got back together with her ex, she purposely hurt him by comparing his anatomy to the guy she slept with while they were broken up. Their sex life was never the same. He felt inadequate and nothing she said after could make up for it. As a result, they had less satisfying sex a lot less often.... until they broke up for good. **6. Feelings about an unresolved argument are blocking one from feeling sexual.** \-This has happened to me, my friends, and my partners. Some people can go from argument to sex without causing an issue with the sex, others can't. If I feel disrespected, like my feelings don't count, or my partner doesn't care about how their actions affect me, I can't just ignore it. I've tried on many occasions to have sex anyways hoping I'd get in the mood, but it usually ends up being super unsatisfying and I feel quite depressed after, even crying right after sex. So, I say no instead of that. **7. There is a lack of physical intimacy outside of sex, making the ""no"" partner feel used for sex rather than connected to their partner.** \-Life gets busy, sometimes less cuddling, hugging, and kissing happens. Sometimes less physical intimacy outside of sex makes one feel disconnected from their partner and if that partner only seeks them out when they want sex, they then feel used rather than wanted. **8. The partner is going through something stressful and just cannot get to a place to feel sexual.** \-This has happened with my husband a lot. He has dealt with such horrendously scary, dangerous, and stressful situations (being targeted by the corrupt local police after reporting crimes on his person and then being locked up in a mental hospital to discredit his claims that the police didn't investigate, for example) and of course he couldn't think about sex. He could barely think about anything positive with the ever-looming fear of being locked up if ever needing to report something again. What works is flat out telling him he will need to initiate when he is in the mood and allow me to ""take care of things"" myself when I feel the need. This approach helped as he felt less like he was disappointing me and less pressured. I've had to accept sex less often. \-Less extreme example: my friend, who is a notorious perfectionist, started a new and stressful job. She spent a lot of time at work, spent time at home preparing for work, and then had nightmares about work. It took about 4 months for her to adjust. Nothing her partner could do could overcome the stress she was experiencing. **9. Pain. Either sex causing the pain or being in pain in general.** \-Outside of those who find certain types of pain stimulating, pain is exhausting and not sexy for many. \-There is a condition affecting 10% of women called Endometriosis, one of the major symptoms is pain: pain during menstruation, pain during ovulation, pain during and/or after sex, pain all month long. Women with this condition vary in how they feel from painful periods and not being aware they have this condition to such debilitating pain all month that they can't hold down a job. A number of women with this condition experience extreme pain during or after sex. They go onto online support groups and share heartbreaking stories of everything from their partners not believing they are in pain (and that being why the women don't want to have sex) to their partners pressuring or forcing sex despite the women being in such pain they bawl their eyes out during sex. If your partner says it hurts, believe her. \-Back pain affects sex. Sometimes partners cannot be turned on while in pain, are aware they might lose an erection (so they avoid sex to prevent embarrassment), have to accept they cannot function in all the positions they used to, or are currently not in pain but are terrified sex might bring back unbearable pain.. Again, believe them. **10. Unable to express their desires.** \-I have known people who either were too embarrassed or ashamed to express what really got them going, or who didn't feel safe expressing them to their current partner. Open communication is an ideal that not everyone can achieve. Pay attention to how you react when your partner opens up to you about themselves or opinions, do you dismiss them? Do you belittle their opinions or ideas? Do you actively listen? Are you quick to judge? If communication outside of sex is not safe for them, they may struggle to communicate what they want in the bedroom for fear of your reaction about a very sensitive topic. **11. Hormones and/or health conditions.** \-During certain points in life and with certain medications or health conditions, sexual desire dips. Sometimes people are aware of what is causing their low desire, other times they are not. Has your partner recently started new meds or treatment for something? That could be why you get a no. **12. Your partner is not interested in a particular activity you want to take part in.** \-I am not against people having consensual anal sex, if they enjoy it or at least it doesn't hurt them and their partner enjoys it and they don't mind taking one for the team. However, I have tried with 3 different partners and it was so unbearably painful (I have health issues with my bowel that I suspect make it more painful) that it's simply something I cannot do. My ex-husband tried it with me and didn't stop or slow down when I said it hurt.  The shock that my pain didn't cause him to immediately stop (as did the other men I tried with before) caused me to feel violated and react by jumping up and running to another room. My ex-husband came after me and yelled saying I reacted as though he raped me when this was a consensual act. He could not understand I reacted that way because he continued on not caring it was hurting me a lot. I explained and he told me he didn't stop because I'd eventually ""get used to it."" I never tried it with him again as I didn't feel safe, and his complaining afterwards made me feel inadequate, like every other woman he had been with before me was better simply for having anal sex. This greatly reduced how much sex we had as I felt like without anal sex, he would be unsatisfied and complain. **13. ""No"" is said because the desire to please one another no longer feels reciprocal.** \-One of my friends flat out stopped having sex with an ex she was living with because he refused to give her oral sex. He told her that intercourse was what she enjoyed, so she didn't need to receive oral sex. However, oral sex was what he enjoyed, so he needed it. She refused to give him oral sex if he wouldn't reciprocate, so he refused to have intercourse. I think their dry spell lasted 6 months. He even told her masturbation, for him, was more satisfying than intercourse, so it didn't matter if they didn't have any form of sex together. (Side note: never been so happy to hear about a break up as when they broke up!) \-For me, it ended up me giving oral sex way, way, way more often than I was getting it, so I no longer wanted to do it. My partner at the time didn't notice he basically stopped giving me oral sex months before I stopped giving it and complained that I would no longer do it. \-My husband enjoys giving oral sex. His ex-wife was very old-fashioned and it felt wrong for her. Rather than communicate this openly, she made fun of him for not being man enough to rely on his penis to get her off. He wanted sex less often after that and of course, she never gave him oral sex, which he said wasn't the end of the world, but would have been nice variety to add into the mix. **14. There was no build up.** \-Honestly, most of the time in this, my longest ever relationship, we tell the other we want to have sex, we then each have a shower, and we go to it. But, at times, I need more than that. I want to be seduced. I want to be kissed and touched and my clothes to be slowly taken off. We have worked on that and things happen that way too. It's a nice variety rather than always starting the same way.  So, rather than going right to sex, start with going out, having dinner, going dancing, or a massage, or making out for an extended time. So, what am I missing from this list? And, I hope it might help some people feel less rejected by their partners while others have some questions to ask in order for better communication.","You forgot kids.  Kids in the house.  The ultimate block... This pretty much sums things up. Edit:. Yes I know we created the problem, we had the kids.  I love my kids and wouldn't trade my life for anything.

eiylmg,"Burned the ol’ v-card yesterday.  Imagined it to be like this monumental moment where fireworks went off and there was now world peace and shit (if it had been a day earlier, fireworks might’ve actually gone off lol) but noo it was more like two sweaty slabs of human slamming their bodies against eachother all while sticking our tongues down eachothers throats.  As you can obviously tell I’m very inexperienced with all of this and yesterday was a kind of yolo for me after realizing sex doesn’t just fall onto my lap.   But I did come to several conclusions, and honestly I feel super at peace knowing that it actually wasn’t that big of a deal. 1. For some guys its the opposite, but I think after having watched porn for the past 4 years of my life in addition to furiously jackin the ol’ beanstalk, it is **damn hard** to finish.  In fact I didn’t even orgasm which made knowing when to stop sexxy time pretty difficult.  I really meed to lay off the porn for a while.  2. Holy shit is the vagina hard to find sometimes, and getting it in is even harder.  Ive got average if not under average girth, maybe she was just really tight.  I found it really difficult it some instances to stick it in.  The vagina is a lot fucking lower than I thought.  3. Boobs are amazing. 4. I feel as if I understand myself a lot better.  The sex was fun and all, but like I said, I imagined it slightly different and it was a bit underwhelming.  What I *do* feel though now is a better understanding of myself and what I want from sex.  And that I have a shit ton I need to practice. 5. Having grown up in an incredibly strict fundamentalist christian household, I felt kind of like a piece of shit afterwards.  Like, ashamed.  It’s really difficult trying to rewrite your brain thats been told from day 1 that sex outside of marriage is immoral and disgusting.  I feel better about it though now, and I inherently know there’s nothing to be ashamed about. 6. I was an idiot and had unprotected sex.  Not the whole time, but the second time when we wanted to go for round two.  Eventually put one on but goddamn monkey brain no thinky thinky sometimes.  While I think she was clean, really regret that and I probably want to get tested soon.

ekabo3,"I guess this might be a common issue, I don't know. Been with my bf for just over 4 years now. I was his first everything, even kiss, but I had a bf before him that I did everything with. It's fair to say that he is definitely better looking than I am, so when he became interested in me I jumped at the chance to be with him as he is a great guy and has the looks to boot. I know people will say ""don't be like that I'm sure you're gorgeous too"", but I'm not. I don't think I'm ugly in any way, but I know I'm not the prettiest catch ever, maybe slightly below average on looks.  Anyway, now that we are at Uni, my boyfriend has been around a lot of horny girls, as is natural at Uni. I wouldn't lie if I said I wasn't interested in all of that, because I was. When he came to me with the idea of being in an open relationship, I knew it was because he was speaking to this girl, so I agreed to let him have sex with her, on the condition that I could be with other guys too, which he agreed to. I downloaded Tinder for the first time ever and holy moly Tinder is filled with thirsty guys. I've never received that much attention in my life. So I began speaking to some of them and eventually went on a date with a few of them. It was getting to the point where sex was being talked about, so I sat down with my bf one night and said that I am going to see this guy to have sex. He seemed a little shocked at first, but was totally fine with it, told me to have fun, yadda yadda. So I ended up having sex with the guy and it was great, we did it a few times over the course of the next week.  Now guy two gets interested in sex, so yet again I bring it up with my bf and again he's all like ""have fun"". So I sleep with guy 2 as well. My bf then says that I don't need to tell him whenever I have sex with someone else, so I say ""sure okay, but I still wanna know when you fuck this other girl"", and he says okay, and tells me they had sex the night before. No problem.  So after a few weeks of not really bringing it up, he asks have many times I've had sex in the 4 or so weeks we'd been open. To be honest I'd lost count. I'd been sleeping with the 3 aforementioned guys regularly, so I responded with, ""idk, like 15 times or something"".  My bf then gets incredibly quiet and upset, and he tells me that the open relationship was a mistake and that he thought it would be a lot more even than it currently is, and didn't expect me to be sleeping around so much. I tried to console him but he just went to sleep. This was last night, and he barely said a word to me this morning.  Is there anything I can do or say to salvage this? I really love this guy, and whilst I don't want to give up sleeping with the other guys, I will if it is the only way to save this relationship.",He's pretty naive if he didn't expect this to happen.,4985
ekl6zx,"My friends have always poked fun of me for this opinion. But the thing I enjoy most about sex is cuddling up half naked after you both finished and either watching something, talking, or just falling asleep. I know this isn’t really a “manly” thing to say, but I’m not super masculine, and was wondering if others feel the same way. Sometimes I even get horny not really for the sex. But just the feeling and cuddling afterwards.","Cuddling is part of good ""aftercare"" and really builds intimacy imo. My bf and I usually cuddle for 30 min to an hour and that involves taking turns giving each other back rubs/back massages, I’ll rest my head on his chest while he strokes my hair, or he’ll rest his head on my chest and I’ll stroke his head/face. If he massages my breasts, round 2 usually follows so I’m not complaining! We love cuddling post-sex.",1267

enobgx,"Many of us frequently hear about sex where the man finishes, the woman doesn’t because the man doesn’t really try to help her, she says “it’s okay” (when it probably isn’t) and he just rolls over to sleep like it’s no big deal.  Last night, I received a small taste of what that must feel like for the millions (and probably billions) of women who have experienced that at some point in their life.  My girlfriend (F28) and I (M30) have been together for over a year. Sex has always been amazing where she used to finish regularly. However recently, she went on antidepressants which have made finding her orgasm a real challenge. We’ve gone weeks where we frequently have sex where I’m the only one that finishes (though we are in love, I would imagine that was probably irritating). When it does happen for her, we feel like popping a celebratory bottle of champagne. And fortunately, after a lot of experimentation of what works and what doesn’t in our new normal, she is starting to come more regularly.  Anyway, last night she turned to me and said she wanted to have sex. After a massage, and a mix of oral, fingering and using vibrators, she had an intense finish. We cuddled for a bit as she came down, and then she got up and said “I’m gonna go to the bathroom, I’ll be back” and winked at me.  Now here I was thinking “ah yes, my turn”, but then she comes back in the room, kisses me and says “goodnight darling”. The lights go off.  First thing that runs through my mind is “what the hell!” and felt myself becoming annoyed and resentful that I didn’t get to finish. I asked myself “should I bring this up?” “Why doesn’t she care about this?” and reams of other questions. I decided to shelve it and go to sleep.  Even though I’m a tad annoyed still, the morning has brought some helpful reflections, some of which I knew already and some which were new: 1) Particularly if you’re with a partner for awhile, finishing is not a scoreboard. You’re in the sack with them because you enjoy intimacy with them.  Coming is not the final goal nor is it something you’re entitled to. This comment I’m aiming particularly at men and not at women since I’m pretty sure most women already get this. And also because... 2) Holy shit, so many women in the world must be frustrated. They really take the whole “not coming because your partner doesn’t try to help you” and it happening so regularly on the chin like champs. I wish I could collectively upvote all the women on reddit on that basis alone.  3) I realise I’m speaking from a position of privilege as a man on this one, so sorry if I get this wrong. I can’t know the dynamics of everyone’s relationships or sex lives. But if you’re having unsatisfying sex, you need to speak up. It’s not okay to act like it’s okay. If I sat here pissed off about not getting off one time, I can’t imagine having a sex life where my partner doesn’t make an effort and me not telling them about it. Most people want their partners to finish, some because they truly want their partners to enjoy it, others for their own ego. But most people are accepting of feedback, particularly if it’s to help you come. 4) That said...Guys, we gotta do better. I’m not speaking to all of us here, but there’s a reason why they’re so many articles online from women asking or advising the best way to broach conversations with their partners about being unsatisfied with sex. Don’t assume what works on one women will work on another. And though I’m probably guilty of this, always look for ways to keep things fresh in the bedroom. Routine is the harbinger of staleness and boredom. Finally, when it doubt, just ask her. The strongest thing you can do is get out of the way of your own ego, be a bit vulnerable, and ask her what works for her and what doesn’t.","Thank you for speaking on this. This hits home for me. I've been with my boyfriend for 5yrs, and not once has he ever even asked ""did you finish?"" I dont think he cares if I do. Ive been responsible for my own orgasms since we started having sex. I've only had 1 orgasm (with the help of my own hand) with him in our 5yrs. He dosent give me the chance to finish, theres not even foreplay. Its extremely frustrating.",1613

epm3kq,"So last evening, after a whole day of teasing him, with pics and a couple of naughty ideas, I decided to have some fun post-dinner wearing only my favorite thong. About a minute into the blowjob, I noticed he got real quiet, closed his eyes in concentration, and before I could get my bearings, bam! Let's say I was lucky not to get anything in my eyes or hair.  Awkward ... you say? No!  He did something no other guy I've been with did. He told me he was blown away by my thong and I was just too sexy for him. He flipped me over, and told me to relax and let him do his thing till he's ready for round 2. And do his thing he did. He ate me out for possibly the longest time ever (yay, refractory period?) and we had an amazing round 2. I was blown away by how confidently he handled it. I've had plenty a guy wilt away and I have had to tread on eggshells the whole night making sure he didn't feel bad. But don't! It's flattering, I can't believe all it needed was some sexting and a thong, and you bet I'm going to try again! And the way he treated me afterwards, ... pure class! That's how you do it guys, and let me say, if you're ever shamed for accidents, please stand up for yourself. It's not cool and I know the effect it can have on the confidence of guys.","wow, he sounds like a freaking keeper, just saying.  why do guys feel so bad about it? are there women who shame them for it?

ergt4k,"I was hanging out with my girlfriends and the topic of sex came up. I was the last person to lose their virginity in this group and one of my friends used to call me vanilla because I didn’t watch porn. I’m a late bloomer, didn’t start having sex until I got with my first long term boyfriend in my late 20s. Since getting with my boyfriend I quickly got to know my sexy side. He’s my first and plan on him being my last. He has a lot of experience, so I let him take the lead in our sex life. I learned pretty early that he really likes to cum on my face. He said my face looked so good with cum on it and it always made him really happy when I let him. His moans are the best when he shoots on my face. I pretty much let him do this whenever. I found out I really like cum, so I always eat whatever gets on my face after.  Anyways, I was telling my girlfriends that my bf usually finishes on my face and they all looked super shocked. My friend that always calls me vanilla immediately asked how often I let him do this and I said whenever he wants, which is pretty often. It’s his preferred method of finishing. I love it, so it doesn’t bother me. She started laughing and said my boyfriend had me “trained” well. I asked her what she meant, she said facials were not normal and said that I was giving him too much. All my other friends were pretty much in agreeance, one said they would never do a facial and another said she only does it if he’s been “a really good boy.” I told her she made her man sound like a dog. To which she responded, “well, aren’t they?”  Everyone laughed and the topic moved on, but I felt really judged. Is it really so bad that I let my boyfriend cum on my face all the time? I honestly really like it and his reaction is so amazing. Is there a name for people who actually like cum? Edit: RIP my inbox and chats. I’m going to try to get to all these messages of support! Edit 2: I have a boyfriend... I mentioned him in the story... we are monogamous. Edit 3: Some people are asking why I was sharing my sex life. We were watching a tv show called Insecure and in the episode the main character gets an unexpected facial. My friends thought it was gross, but since I was silent on the matter they asked if I would let a guy cum on my face. Then we had the rest of the conversation.","What the hell does ""You are giving your SO too much"" even mean. The whole using sex as a dog treat of sorts that some people do really irks me, I've heard pretty much the exact same things in conversation with some girl friends of mine.

euhl5b,"I’m (25F) already crazy about him (31M), but this made me fall even harder. We’ve been dating since New Years. He was traveling all week and we had some very flirty texts going back and forth while he was gone. He asked me to come over for a movie night Friday and I knew what that meant. Legs shaved, hair done, cute undies, I was so ready to take that next step with him. After the movie we were making out on the couch, and in the moment, I said, “Are you going to take me upstairs?” And he paused and shyly said, “Is it okay if I say no?” I told him of course it was okay, but, if he wanted to share, I was curious why? He said “Well we haven’t really talked about it yet. I didn’t know if you were ready to take that step, by now that I do, maybe we could do that now?” We spent the next three hours snuggling and discussing birth control, contraceptives, sexual health (if we were both clean), past sexual partners, boundaries, kinks, fantasies, anything at all! It was absolutely perfect. I felt so close to him, and it was fun and sweet and sexy and I wasn’t upset at all we didn’t do it that night. I ended up staying the night with him, before we went all the way, which was a first for me but not as weird as I thought!

Plus standard missionary is also the most work possible for the guy (outside of weird porno positions). I will say, strictly in terms of PiV enjoyment, the pleasure a woman gets from this position is probably going to depend a fair bit on the shape the guy's penis.

It was almost over powering, I initially was gonna try and just eat her pussy cause otherwise her hygiene was good.... but I had to stop as my dick was not getting hard even though she was sucking it.

So long as none of her hard limits are touched, she'll pretty much let me do anything. This got me thinking, and after a bit of consideration I decided I would try a bit of dominant play. The idea was to make some speech the like of ""I'm going to take you whenever, wherever and however I want from now on"", and see how she would react to then decide wether to take it further (as in, actually do that) or let it slide as a one time thing and leave it at that. I expected her to be willing to try it out, I didn't expect her to take to it like a fish to water.

f6xem6,"I’ve(28F) always been attracted to super skinny guys, like when I see a guy with skinny legs in tight jeans, I just melt! But lately I’ve been seeing a bigger guy. He’s probably 5’7 and 230lb I would guess. I was worried I wouldn’t be into it, but it’s so amazing! I love the way his bigger belly fills in the gap between us so I can always feel his warm body on me. His thighs feel so warm and soft and comforting. Another bonus is, his stomach keeps him from thrusting too deeply/gives me enough room to touch myself while in missionary, so I can orgasm in a position I’ve never been able to before.  Anyways, this Pulp fiction quote has always been intriguing to me and this situation reminds me of it a bit. Like it’s interesting how visually I love skinny men and that aesthetic turns me on, but there’s something very sexy and comforting to me about the way a bigger guy feels.

f8apk7,"My girlfriend (F19) and I (M20) were having a conversation last night about when she gets back from school how we will be able to have more consistent sex and how great it will be and I kinda stopped and was thinking about how guys will ask for blowjobs, maybe push the head down a little. We do a lot of BDSM and as the dominant I will just climb and sit on her chest and fuck her mouth or what not. But she never asks for anything and when I told her she could she got all excited. I told her that if she wants something, ask for it! Don’t be shy! It’s very rare that I would ever not be in the mood. Want me to go down on you? Wanna sit on my face? Finger you? Do a certain position? Whatever it may be, I told her to tell me and she said that she never realized that she could do that. She always felt subconsciously that sex is a male dominated activity and girls just kinda go along with it. I told her just like i can ask for a blowjob sometimes and i don’t have anymore expectations for sex after that, she can do that too. We both just want to please each other. Even in a BDSM relationship where she’s the sub, she can ask for things! And I’ll probably give it to her after a bit of teasing or withholding but I just want to please her and I always try and make sure she cums before i do. Ladies, please ask! No this doesn’t mean you should have to ask every time you want someone to go down on you or else you won’t get it. But it’s all about communication, if you don’t communicate then your sex will never be as fulfilling as it could be.

fc170q,"I decided that I'd lose my virginity with a random guy from Tinder if I hadn't had sex by 18. Well, I turned 18 a few weeks ago and matched with a pretty hot guy. He knows I'm a virgin and, since I'm on the pill (heavy periods) and says he was recently tested, doesn't want to wear a condom. This kind of goes against what I've been taught in school about safe sex. What he wants isn't normal in the real world, is it? **Edit: Thank you all for the responses, I wasn't expecting this thread to blow up. I put my foot down as advised and told him that I'm 100% not having sex without a condom. That changed his mind pretty quickly and he's agreed to wear one now. I'm going to his place in a few hours time when he gets back from university, so have plenty of time to take a shower and redo my hair and makeup. I might update this post tomorrow, depending on how things go...** ---- **Update:** I went over to his place a little after 18:00. He lives in student accommodation for my city's main university and is a year older than me. Reading some of the replies I got sort of freaked me out (that he might 'stealth' me or I might be murdered?!), so I took a a few caps from a bottle of vodka I had in my car to try chilling out first. I walked the final stretch after this and sent him a text to say that I was outside. He came down to let me in, then led me up to his room. He poured us both some drinks and we started off cuddling on his bed as we sort of watched the TV, talked a little bit and he played with my hair. After a while, we started kissing and he was feeling me up. I was definitely nervous about getting undressed (I'm very petite, 5'2"", fluctuate around 105lbs, small boobs, etc.), but pushed past this. He gave my tits so attention first, which was a confidence boost, before moving onto oral. This felt amazing, he seemed good at it and was attentive. It lasted for maybe 10-15 minutes, but I couldn't come (probably just nerves) His clothes started coming off at this point and I saw he had an amazing body too. I've given blowjobs to two other guys at partys before, so knew what to do next to get him fully hard. He loved this but stopped me after a couple of minutes to lay a towel down on his bed. I was feeling a bit awkward about bringing up that he needed to get a condom at this point, but he ended up grabbing one himself before I had to ask, which was a huge relief. He might have seen me staring as he put it on, just to make sure haha. He was very slow as he first put it inside me, but I definitely felt something tearing and there was more blood than I'd expected (having spoken to a few friends). I got over this after a little while and started to enjoy myself a bit, despite still feeling somewhat terrified. He had me in a few positions to see what I liked the most with a few variations as well (pillow under my back). Some of these felt fantastic, but I still couldn't come. Again, I presume this was just nerves. This lasted quite a while actually, before he worked out I probably wasn't going to finish. He asked me to finish him with head. I saw him tie off a positively intact condom at this point, so I definitely wasn't ghosted. He gave me a little tap just before he came, which I decided to spit onto the towel. He offered me oral in return, but I wasn't really interested because I probably wouldn't finish which might make him feel bad. We ended up having a few more drinks after I quickly peed (thanks for the tip, whoever that was), cuddled and he played with my boobs. I was too drunk to drive home afterwards so ended up taking the bus. I'm glad to have finally lost the virgin label and the experience was actually pretty good. It was great that he didn't try to push condomless sex on me, since I really wouldn't have known what to do at that point. He actually turned out to be a good guy. It definitely would have been better if I finished, but I honestly think this was just my nerves getting the better of me. I reflected on everything this morning and have no regrets.","No, no it’s not. If he’s not going to respect your needs, keep searching.",4025
fcsk12,"My parents found out that I, their 19-almost-20 year old daughter, has sex with her boyfriend of nearly a year. They are upset and my mom feels shocked and betrayed that i’d ever think that was okay, despite her never talking to me about sex and relationships past the age of 12 where I was too young to even remember the advice because I wasn’t thinking about that stuff so young. Now me and my boyfriend aren’t allowed to sleep in the same bed when he’s over, as if that would stop us from having sex if we wanted to anyway.  It’s crazy to me that they don’t understand that I’m a full adult who is perfectly capable and responsible for her own decisions. Nice. I respect their rules but still, what the hell. EDIT: I really didn’t expect so many comments. Thanks everyone for the replies and advice, especially from parents. While some of you are saying things like “fuck that stupid rule, move out” they’re still my parents, and I still don’t want to disrespect them when they support me in so many ways. Me and my BF can still sleep in the same bed at his house, and we can still hang out as much as normal, so it’s not the end of the world. It will definitely be tough to get through 4 years of long distance without it though. And my parents will probably drive me away by enforcing a dumb rule like this but hey, it’s their own fault.",So your parents let you sleep in the same bed when he stayed over? And they're surprised you're having sex? That's kinda contradicting don't you think?  So punishment is no more sharing a bed?  I'm speechless,5767
fdrznm,"Had an interesting experience today. My FWB and I went a bit longer without seeing each other and she was kind of upset about how I ignored her for a while (work is really demanding right now). So today when I came over she immediately had a face on that made me think we were going to have an argument. Instead we went straight into things.  Now for context I'm a very experienced dominant partner, not necessarily full on BDSM but choking, spanking, pinning arms behind her back, a little slapping, hair pulling etc.  I've cleared each action early on with her and in the moment too I often double check to see how rough she wants to go. In addition I'm 6'2"" 195 lbs and athletic, she's 5'3"" 108 lbs.  So today when she got on top and started biting me I knew I was in for a role reversal. However soon I had been slapped in the face twice (something I've never had) and when I tried to playfully pin her arms behind her back got punched. Square in the chest.  We ended up finishing and I said to her ""what was that?"" Her response was nonchalant: ""I was mad at you"".  As someone that has been doing this for a while that was a pretty huge red flag. Pain inflicted during sex is for the purpose of pleasure not revenge or anger. So to girls out there thinking your guy is hurting you in anger 1) run away from that relationship but also 2) don't retaliate because if he isn't abusive its probably just some good kinky fun. No punching without permission either. To the guys: just because she's smaller, cuter, or usually submissive doesn't mean she can just break out and use abusive behavior as a ""response"" to an argument or to break the routine of you leading or delivering the rough stuff.","Yeah huge red flag. Not something I would tolerate and if she doesn't see that she crossed a thick red line, if she gives you some shit about ""you're a big man you can take it"" or something, you just found yourself a person who's shit when their emotions are high and worth not seeing again.",1883
fel9zk,"I have never met someone who was so confused, startled, and uncertain when I got on top of him to ride him lmao. I got on top and he just laid there with his arms at his sides. Didn't touch me, didnt make any noise... Just stared at me. I have only heard of women laying like a dead fish but this..must be how it feels.  I thought he just wasn't interested in the sex, which was confusing since he was the one who initiated it, but I understand not being sexually compatible with someone.  Only to find out later on that he has only ever done missionary, so he had no idea what to do.  He has had 6 or 7 partners before me.. Who ONLY DID MISSIONARY WHAT?!!?! That poor guy Edit: We absolutely talked about it afterwards lol. Communication is key and I'm not shy talking about sex or my preferences. He had always wanted to explore sexually but his partners only wanted missionary. So I talked him through and demonstrated some different positions, what felt good to me, what felt good for him, etc.",Wait until he learns about doggy style!,4110
ff1t49,"I hooked with a guy once who was fairly young (21) when I was 19 at the time. We got a hotel (classy af lol) and he was very sweet. Then the sex happened.. So this dude has me at the edge of the bed, and he's standing there goin at it and it was going pretty good until he pulled out and started pacing around the room and I was like ???? You good? Then he walks back, sticks it back in, goes at it, pulls out, DROPS TO THE FLOOR AND DOES SOME PUSH UPS, gets up and sticks it back in...HE IS DRIPPING SWEAT ALL OVER ME AT THIS POINT. I mean dripping. Internally I was screaming. Dead, confused, concerned, grossed out.. I'm sure you can imagine my facial expression.  I kinda just...let him finish. Didn't fake moan, just...breathed. I mean he was trying his hardest and things could be improved after a good ole chat, right? Thinking back on it, he was probably trying not to cum. But that was NOT the way to do it. Maybe stop moving your dick for a second and just kiss me while you wait it out but don't go do push ups!!!! Edit: Some of you are thinking he was probably on some type of drug lol and I mean, maybe, but his behavior outside of sex, before and after, was just a normal sweet guy. I did not get a drug vibe from him so I seriously doubt drug use was involved. Again, he was probably just trying to last longer lol in a very unique way",This is fascinating because when I was 18 I was fooling around with a guy (not even sex yet we were just kissing and doing things over our clothes) and I left the room to use the bathroom. When I came back he was naked doing push-ups and I never understood that...,3624
fg6fb9,"Hooked up with a guy once. I'm not vanilla and I can confirm that he is definitely not vanilla. We talked a little bit about what we like, and I mentioned that I like it kinda rough like ass slapping, scratching, hair pulling, choking, biting, or if I trust my partner, being tied up and using handcuffs. Not anything that crazy, though. Well. He definitely took rough into consideration. The sex was going fantastic. He went a bit hard on the biting and choking than I was used to, but nothing I couldn't handle. OUT OF NOWHERE he just leaned back and slapped me in the face. Not that hard, just enough to startle me. And startled I was. I laid there for a second and processed because I did NOT expect that. I was like ""Oh shit"" then ""Did I like that??"" Then he did it again and ""Okay. No no, don't like that."" Lmao that was a whole new experience and once I determined that I didn't like being slapped, I said so, and he never did it again. Plot twist: turned out he just got out of prison for identity theft too  Edit: On a more serious note, for those of you that are concerned that I was abused, thank you for worrying, but this was not a case of abuse. I told him I like ""rough"" and that was pretty broad. ""Rough"" can be decoded differently, depending on how someone defines rough. The first time having sex with someone is always a learning curve (and even many times after that as you sexually explore with your partner). This was one of those learning curve moments and when I determined that I didn't like it, he didn't do it again when I asked him not to. It didn't hurt at all. Now if I told him to stop doing that, and he kept doing it, or if he straight up gave me a black eye, then that's a whole other story and I'm sorry for anyone that has had to go through real abuse/sexual abuse.  Thank you all for looking out!","Okay but while reading this I heard “No, don’t like that.” In exactly Michael Scott’s voice and I just about bust my gut",1593
fjex8q,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 8 years. Our sex life has always been great and we have just clicked from the beginning chemistry wise. When we first started having sex 8 years ago I was adamant that I could only “finish” when on top or using a vibrator. This is still mostly true but some walls have definitely been torn down. Due to life, one of my parents has been living with us in our home for 2.5 years.. resulting in having to sneak and be quiet after having years of a very healthy adventurous sex life.. We make it work, but I had been getting nervous that we were losing our sexual chemistry because of our environment, age (early 30s + 8 years deep into a comfortable relationship is much different than being 18, wild and care free lol), and life stressors in general. I snacked on an adult rice krispie and hopped into bed. Anticipating quiet Sunday night sex after a few junk TV shows because it had been a couple days. But tonight...for the first time ever.. I squirted. All over. SO is sleeping on a towel on top of our sheets because who TF just gets up and does laundry at midnight? Intense fingering with 2 fingers and massive amounts of foreplay, and all of a sudden I lost control and opened my eyes to see what was happening. Just so much. It’s been a very long time since I’ve felt sexually vulnerable due to something new. So many emotions. Embarrassed? Turned on? Happy? Grossed out by the mess? All in all I’m pleased and I think SO is too. He apologized that it took so long to figure this out..  but how could I expect him to know this about me if I didn’t and was insistent it couldn’t happen?!  It’s a first for both of us which is not something we often share because we both have had multiple sexual partners previous to our relationship. Huge turn on for me. What I hate the most is I know why it happened for the first time TONIGHT.  For the first time ever I made a conscious effort to STOP thinking about everything under the sun during intimacy. I get so distracted by anything. I mean anything. “What will I have for lunch tomorrow?” type thoughts. Instead I forced myself to just think and focus on what was happening in front of me. Then about him cumming on me. AND BOOM.  I will never go back to overthinking again. Not sure if it’s the post squirt high or the edible high.. BUT I NEEDED TO TELL SOMEONE so I brought my rambles here :) If anyone makes it through this novel, what other things can be tried when having a noise restriction?","Great timing!

And after she came -- intensely -- she said, ""I think I just squirted.""  She said she felt something pleasurable when she orgasmed, followed by a release of liquid.  We found a large puddle of wetness right below her pussy.  She knows she didn't pee. Squirting for the first time at 60?  Holy fuck!",1038

fqwa2c,"Hi this is a throw away account because we both use reddit regularly and this is a bit private.  I (F28) am writing this.  My husband recently went through a spell where he just wasn’t in the mood for sex. He says that once it happened every other time he felt like there was too much pressure to have sex and it was a turn off, which resulted in less sex, which resulted in more pressure.  So what I did was take matters into my own hands, literally. I told him that I understood and would just masturbate as my libido was constantly higher than his. And then what happened was great. I’d tell him I was going to go do it and after a couple of times he asked if he could watch. Which led to great sex. So I began doing it at night when he was in bed with me, which for me I found was a huge turn on, and obviously was for him to because it usually lead to him joining in or us having sex.  He says that it got rid of the pressure and made sex fun, and that watching me was always a fantasy of his too.  Since then we’ve explored other fantasies, watched porn, I masturbate freely whenever I feel the need, and most of the time he joins in, and if not I am still satisfied. I encouraged him to masturbate too if he needs relief without pressure, but that always just turns to either sex or me finishing him which I love doing. It’s great now especially since we are both “stuck” at home.  Honestly try it. I was super self conscious to begin with, but it has been nothing but a positive experience. My husband says that my taking the lead has seriously taken the pressure off of him and made sex fun again and we are in a great place now. Even hearing that was great because up until now I just thought he wasn’t attracted to me, he’s not great at communicating so I wasn’t aware at how pressured he felt. We’ve now both opened up a lot and it has been nothing but positive for our sex life and relationship overall. So that’s my recommendation. Happy to answer any (appropriate) questions. Take care of yourself and he will join in! TLDR: husband had no sex drive, I told him I was going to start masturbating to meet my needs, this took the pressure off of him and turned him on and has lead to great sex.","While most posts which describe a sexual achievement get referred to the Daily Sexual Achievement Thread, this very thoughtful and original post merits a one-time exception to that rule.

fuwqhr,"Several years ago I had a girlfriend that put on bright red lipstick every time she gave me a blowjob. She liked giving, so this happened fairly regularly. As the months passed, I noticed that as soon as I saw her appear in red lipstick I would start to get aroused. Over time, I was completely erect the moment I saw her in red lipstick. So here’s where it gets fucked up. One day her friend shows up at the gym while I’m working out and she’s wearing the same lipstick, and I immediately get hard (gym shorts, very obvious). Her friend asks why I have an erection and I honestly don’t know. Later that night, my girlfriend asks why I got an erection when I saw her friend at the gym. She then tells me that they both watched the episode of The Office where Jim conditions Dwight with mints and decided to try it out on me. Kind of funny, but also, my brain has literally been re-wired to the point that I get hard any time I see red lipstick so...fuck Pavlov. EDIT: Hey, so I joined Reddit today to tell this story because my friend said it was funny and would lighten the mood during COVID life. You can believe it or not. The friend at the gym was wearing the exact lipstick. She was in on the plan. The gym was apparently the test to see how much I had been affected. It’s bright red lipstick. Totally uncommon.

We women are basically trained (yes, trained) from birth *not* to show our sexuality in any way, shape or form.

If we approach a man we think is cute and ask him on a date, society calls us too forward. Maybe even desperate. From a very young age, women internalize these teachings and they often stick with us throughout our lives. Remember that when you're wondering why your girlfriend or wife never initiates sex with you. Even if they *want* to, they probably have that little voice inside them that's saying ""don't do it"" or ""if you act *too* interested in sex, he'll probably just think you're slutty."" Men are rewarded for being sexual beings while women are (unfortunately) punished for it. By family, by friends, by society as a whole.

We’ve talked and anytime we do she becomes hysterically defensive, saying I should support her in her weight loss (which is what I’m trying to do, the point is she’s not even TRYING to lose weight which is a big issue for me). The other issue is, she’s constantly horny. My wife always had a high sex drive which was wonderful but with the weight gain I’ve been largely put off. She thinks my desire has waived off but it hasn’t. I’m just not attracted to her like I was AND admittedly her casual attitude about her weight gain and just “you have to accept me like I am” approach has really put me off. She’ll wear tank tops and leggings and see thru tops and think it’s a way to turn me on but all it does it show me how large she is. It’s an instant turn off. She won’t talk about it. And I find it hard to get up for her unless I look at porn or think of someone else - terrible I know. What can be done here? I’ll admit her breasts are still amazing so during sex I focus completely on those. Is that the trick? Just tits and close my eyes the rest of the time? Anyone else in this place?

So she's a healthcare worker and works really long shifts lately and comes home absolutely tired. Additionally she takes medication which knocks her out cold, and this impacted our sex life. I first jokingly proposed to her if I could have sex with her in her sleep. Surprisingly she was willing to give it a try. We have been doing this for 4 weeks now and it's surprisingly hot. We have our own code signal, she goes to bed with a babydoll when she wants to be fucked.

I obviously always follow all the rules and everything and I think this is working out great. Has anyone been in this situation before? What was your experience?",While I love the idea and have had similar situations occur my SO loved being awaken to me deep in her. The thing that puzzles me is that she is so sleep that you can roll her on top of you or put heels on her. Just not sure how I feel about that part. But as long as she is ok with it and so are you it is definitely a cool fetish,3047
g402w0,"Maybe not all women are like this, but there's a sizeable amount of us, I know that. When a guy is fine with waiting for sex, or takes sexual rejection really well, or checks in with me during sexytimes and makes sure I know that we can stop at anytime, I find it so incredibly sexy. I instantly become WAY more comfortable with the idea of sex when a guy makes it clear that he does not have any issue with a lack of it. Do guys know that this is the way a lot of women view sex? If they did, do you think there would be fewer guys pressuring and pestering for sex? If you take ""I'm not comfortable with sex yet"" like a champ and be all ""no big deal whenever you're ready"", I'm having sex with that dude SOON. But if a guy starts complaining or trying to talk me into it, my pussy shrivels up like a grape in the sun. Edit: wow I think this is my first post to really blow up so its a bit of a surprise. But thank you for all your answers!! Sex and sexuality is a fascinating topic to me and I love reading everyone’s different thoughts and points of view regarding this topic. Cheers you sexy people!! ❤️","My second gf constantly turned me down for sex but claimed to be just as interested so I decided to no longer bring it up unless she does it first....it was a lonely couple of MONTHS of constant masturbating before I realized she and I are just not sexually compatible....at the time I took it a bit more personal and thought it was me and not her.  Not actually sure to this day my ego 100% recovered despite having many positive sexual relationships since.  &#x200B; If one person is constantly pushing for sex and the other refusing, consider you two might not be right for each other and in the long run will lead to resentment, cheating, and bitterness.

g4dmpq,"My bf and I (both 20s) have been dating 8ish months, and while he’s never been the “turn over and go to sleep” type — he always has been cuddly — I’ve noticed over the past few months that after he cums, he’ll want to kiss me again for a few minutes and usually likes to stay inside me. And he kind of looks down adoringly at me for a few minutes, lol. This is usually when we’re in missionary.  Often, he even puts his head on my shoulder and will snuggle into me for a few minutes before we clean up. I find it very cute, of course, but I’m wondering what brought this on.

It almost felt like we were pretending that we weren’t going to have sex (but we both knew we were) and it made me suuuper wet. As we made out, we intermittently paused to continue folding laundry and talk about a podcast we both listened to. At one point he was still talking and started taking my shorts off.

g7dke4,"You've heard the tired cliched tropes. *Why is the bride smiling on her wedding day? She knows she's given her last blowjob.*  *It's not married sex unless it's filled with regret and over within five minutes.* And so on. I think it's hurting relationships and marriages. My wife and I, married for nearly twenty years have had our ups and downs and rough patches, but we've worked hard to be consistently intimate in ways we both love with each other. It's important! I love blowjobs and she is better at them than ever before. She loves a long deep massage and then sex, and we make sure to find time at least once a week if not more. You bet your ass we're at least trying out kinky things even if our bodies of twenty years back would've been more apt for some of our explorations. How do we not let this tired cliched trope become reality? How do we convince couples to speak up and work on their intimacy issues. If you loved giving BJs before marriage, why stop? Don't stop going down on your woman because you're now in your 40s and life's getting tough. I know you're busy with toddlers, but find a sitter every so often and go to town like the teenagers you once were. Let's make sex after marriage just as positive and important as before.","I think part of the problem is that we depict sex on TV and in the movies as something that ""just happens."" You don't talk before, after, or during, and you definitely don't talk about it. You're just supposedly overcome with your passions. Sure that happens in real life, but if you're waiting for that every time you're going to be disappointed. People don't just need to have sex, they need t talk about it. If you're busy, you might need to schedule it. That's not unromantic because it's planned, it's romantic that you make your physical relationship a priority.

g8wphp,"EDIT/UPDATE AT THE END GUYS! Me and my wife are currently getting divorced. Before this all came into place, we had a break at the start of the year. Before we started it, we agreed that if the opportunity arose we'd be ok for the other to have sex with other people while we were on this break.  Well it happened for me. A couple of months ago, while I was on a night out, I bumped into an old colleague who had her cute girl friend out with her. She was really attractive, funny and we hit it off so once the alcohol was flowing I went back to hers and we started to hook up. And it was absolutely awful. Not her fault though, it was all mine. I couldn't get the anxiety of bring with someone new out my head (I've been with the wife for 14 years and married for 10) and I just felt like I was cheating. As a result, I couldn't keep hard and couldn't even finish. To top it off, I burst into tears!  What makes it worse is that she was so nice about it all. She didn't show any signs of annoyance or anger, was really sympathetic and even gave me a hug! And being so English, made me a cup of Tea at 4 AM and sat there listening to me pour my heart out.  All this has been going through my mind while sitting here this past few days reflecting on my Divorce and what's happened recently.  I just feel so bad for this woman - she didn't deserve that. I hate the thought of exposing someone to that.  Would I be weird if I sought her out and apologised after after this time? Or should I leave it be? EDIT So I found her and private messaged her on her Instagram this afternoon. I basically said (in a nutshell) that I know it's been a couple of months now but I just wanted to thank her for that night and I really appreciated her kindness, hearing me out and for just being awesome to me in my moment of weakness and being there for me when I felt bad.  I wasn't expecting a reply so quickly but she came back to me super fast! She said she was so glad to hear from me and that she thought it was lovely to hear that. She said she really enjoyed that night, and she said I have nothing to feel as about, she enjoyed meeting a guy who was so honest and had my guard down around her. She said she would love to hear from me again one day and if I ever needed a vent over another 4am cup of tea, to drop her a line anytime! Then I got a follow request from her too.  As you can imagine I accepted. I responded saying I really appreciate that and when I've got my shit together, I'll take her up on that and she can vent to me anytime too.  Looks like I've made a friend guys. Thank you all so much.","Thank her :) she’s clearly a lovely person. You don’t even need to bring up the sex.

g8yv93,"Me [20M] and my girlfriend [20F] live together in a one bedroom apartment. We have been together for 3 years. She was video chatting her friends in the living room late at night while I was in the bedroom. She must have thought I was asleep. She wears earbuds when she video chats so she's louder than she realizes. I could hear my girlfriend say some really hurtful things about me. I'll list them:  -My pubes are overgrown and gross -I'm terrible at eating her out -She wishes my dick was bigger -My sense of fashion sucks -My voice is too high and a turn off  She has never voiced any of these concerns to me. I thought she was attracted to me and enjoyed having sex with me. The only things I've said to my friends about our sex life is that she's great in bed and has an amazing body.   When she went to bed, I pretended to be asleep. BUT SHE TRIED TO ""WAKE ME"" UP AND HAVE SEX WITH ME. I was so confused and really sad still so I turned her down saying I was tired. I turned around and (this is really embarrassing) I tried really hard not to start crying but I did. I couldn't stop myself. I've never cried in front of her before this. She could hear me despite me trying to keep it quiet. She asked me what was wrong but I just said I need space and went to the living room.

gbdri1,"*IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR GIRL IS FINISHING, PLEASE READ THIS POST* I have a billion girlfriends who fake orgasms throughout the entire relationship. I’ve faked for an entire relationship. I don’t think guys really understand how common it is to fake and how much pressure it can put on your relationship. Before you go, ‘nah my girl wouldn’t do that, plus I can tell that they’re real’, I promise you that if she wants to fake and have you not know, you will not know. A lot of the time girls start faking right off the bat because they don’t feel comfortable taking their time or giving directions when they’re with you for the first time.  And once you fake once in a relationship, it’s a really hard rut to get out of. When she fakes the first time she’s already set the standard for how long it takes her and what you have to do to get her there, when in reality you might need a lot more guidance and time to get her off.  I’ve been in a position where I had been faking from the get-go and ended up trying to show him how to finish me but because I was taking much longer than I ‘usually did’, he got discouraged and gave up.  Girls need to come just as much as guys do. Imagine if you were in a relationship and having sex for two months and hadn’t come. Imagine 6 months. Imagine 2 years. It’s the exact same for a girl. It’s incredibly frustrating and puts a barrier in between you two and you might not even know about it. It puts pressure on your relationship and makes her wonder if there are other options out there. It can be really, really hard to tell someone that you’ve been faking the entire time because you can feel really silly and self conscious and nobody wants to bruise their partner’s ego. I’m gonna be honest, few women are ever going to bring up the fact that they’re faking and sooooooo many are. Btw don’t get mad at girls if they are faking, girls learn that they should be coming on command like in porn and movies and think if they don’t, something is wrong with them. If I had been sat down by my s/o and seriously asked if I’d been coming, I would have been so much more comfortable telling them the truth. If a boy had given me an out and told me that they wouldn’t be hurt but they just needed to know, that would have been such a relief and my relationships when I was younger probably wouldn’t have ended because of all of the frustration on my end. So. I need you to sit your girl down and say these words: “hey, I wanna make sure that you’re finishing. I know that a lot of girls pretend to finish to make their partner feel better, but Id rather have to relearn how to do it or take more time to do it than have you not finishing. It’s totally okay if you’re not, but it’s important to me to know if you aren’t so we can figure it out. You know you can tell me if you aren’t finishing, right?” ( that last line used to say, “Have you ever pretended to finish?” instead, but after some talk in the comments, we thought this would be better and less accusatory) This is a *sensitive* topic for women. They might initially say no even if they are. Make sure she knows she could always tell you, no matter what, if she ever had been. I promise this talk will only do good things for your relationship. If she’s faking, it gives her an out. If she’s not, it shows what a great guy you are for having a talk just to make sure she’s coming.  Edit: just so y’all understand how prevalent faking is: in 2010 researchers found that about 80% of women fake about half the time. Later they found that 25% of women fake every time they have sex.  If you can look at that and say, “welp, sounds like a you problem”, that’s an issue. Faking literally isn’t talked about and many women have no idea how to bring it up. That info is finally getting circulated more, but men can help too. By showing that you’re invested in making sure she’s satisfied and recognizing that faking is super common, you can take the edge off of the conversation.  Also I’m not saying that everybody is faking. I’m just saying it would be uncool to ignore how prevalent it is.","I used to ask, years ago; in a 16 year marriage. I stopped asking if she faked, but I still ask if she's satisfied, every time. On the few times the answer was no, I would use hands and/or toys to continue.",1668
gcrs7u,"I've tried an experiment this month, at home. I masturbated every day, starting from the first day of my last period, just to find out how my orgasms changed day by day. I dont use a vibrator, just my finger and clit stimulation.  -Days 1-2: zero orgasms, I was in too much pain, and felt sick. I had no interest whatsoever.   -Days 3-5: I was in a better mood, orgasms were great.  -Days 6-10: orgasms were very powerful.  -Days 11-17: Mostly good. During ovulation it was kinda underwhelming. I expected better. But I thought about penises and men A LOT.  -Days 18-22: my libido tanked. I did it because I had to, but honestly I couldn't care less. Orgasms were very meh.  -Days 23-27: my libido was high as hell, Probably the BEST orgasms this month. Intense and long. I had 5 in a row on day 25.

gj0ijz,"UPDATE: So - my main issue wasn't actually lack of sex, it was the frustration of feeling like if I initiate it won't work, so I have to wait for him. I spoke to him about the issue and he explained that I often don't pick very good moments. For example, I'd initiate when he's stressed about a project or full up from eating a big meal. He says that he chooses the right moment to initiate and that's why it seems like we only have sex if he initiates. I do have a slightly higher sex drive so we're going to start planning sex time. This is another example of just communicate with your partner! The lesson I learn time and time again is to keep nothing to yourself in a relationship. Thanks for your responses :)  I stopped initiating a while ago because getting turned down makes me feel so awful. I have a higher sex drive than him so more often then not, he’s not in the mood and I end up feeling rejected and upset.  I’m sure loads of people have this problem too. The person with the lower sex drive ends up in a more powerful position because when they feel like sex they can initiate it and their partner won’t turn down the rare opportunity to get what they crave.  When he wants it - he can have it. When I want it - I have to... hope for the best.  My friend suggested I started turning him down every so often to rebalance the power and make him want what he can’t have. I did but - he just wasn’t that bothered. Now it’s been the longest we’ve gone without sex. He hasn’t even noticed and it’s all I can think about.","Relationships are not about power balances, they're about love. Talk to your partner. If he knows it's important to you (and is consenting, obviously) then you could talk about your needs. Like, I know it doesn't sound sexy, but asking him what triggers a mood for him, even if it's rare. Then trying around then. Another thing is if you're both busy, you could also schedule sex. I know it doesn't sound sexy, but if you're having trouble with the initiation, then maybe that's the fix. Whenever you're both the most relaxed and awake. I'm not saying do something he doesn't want to, but I sometimes watch romantic comedies (which I do not enjoy) with my wife because I know it's important to her. Talk to him, explain how important it is to you to be close to him physically, then work out a plan. And if that sounds scary or it doesn't work, check out r/deadbedrooms for some motivation. Good luck!",7094

gjr0de,"I've met two distinct sorts of guys when it comes to how generous they are in the sack.

It's enjoyable on its own and just a prelude to sex, not a necessary stepping stone to finish off. And yes, while I won't deny that plenty of guys can be good at actual sex, the ones who win out long-term are the ones who are generous before. And it shouldn't surprise anyone should it? After all girls are expected to have that attitude right? Imagine giving a blowjob till you got hard and no more, how silly would that be? That's where the fun starts! Do others also observe that there are distinct ways people think about foreplay and maybe one is better than the other, or maybe not, but compatibility on this issue is key!

Every single one of these women told me how I was the nicest guy they’ve ever met and one thought that I had feelings for her based on the way I was treating her.  So what is it about me that makes me the nicest guy ever? Well I told them they didn’t have to have sex with me or do anything they didn’t want to do. That’s it.

So just a shoutout to all the girls that don't mind making the first move for all of us awkward guys out there!","Thanks for the shout out! During the first time I ""hung out"" with my husband I wore a slutty dress, sat next to him on his bed and played with the holes in his Jeans. He didn't get the hint and I asked my uber driver on the way home if I was misreading the situation, lol. The next time we hung out we watched a movie at my place and I shoved his hand into my bra. Solved that problem real fast.",3120
gtuvyn,"I made a previous post here saying that I had no sex drive and I had a desire to raise it to please my boyfriend, got a few pointers and honestly it worked. My boyfriend and I have been spending a lot of intimate time together as per the advice, fishing, cuddling, massaging eachother and relaxing. This morning I felt oddly hyper and fidgety and waited for my boyfriend to come home, immediately I felt a hot rush to my tummy and kind of led him to the bedroom (it felt kind of awkward to lead him but I felt very proud that I did it). I don't know what came over me, I read some erotic literature before he came home to kind of prepare but seeing him I felt electricity and warmth rush between my thighs. It was amazing. I haven't felt desire like this, or even wanted to have much sex but I felt so good I even made noises and my toes curled, I had to shove my face in the pillows to hide my embarrassment at the noises that came out of me. We went fishing afterwards and the whole time I couldn't get it off of my mind, I felt really squirmy, warm and needy. As soon as we got home I felt more confident and took him straight to bed and rode him for the first time in probably two years. It was so fun and it felt amazing, I feel more sensitive on my body and closer to him. I know it's only been one day but I hope this keeps up, I want this to keep happening and I want to keep pleasing him (because frankly it has me going wild right now, I'm resisting waking him up for more since he works early) I'm just very happy and wanted to share and thank everyone who gave me advice.",Which advice worked?,282
gvyq3g,"I wanted to discuss “permanent” birth control: I have never once been pregnant and do not want children. I’m in my 30’s and I got a tubal ligation to prevent pregnancy. This is considered a “sterilization” procedure. Well, a couple years later and I have my first ever pregnancy. It was ectopic, partially ruptured and causing internal bleeding. It had to be removed via emergency surgery last week. Ectopic pregnancy can be life threatening. Since they were operating already, I had them perform a bilateral salpingectomy to completely remove the tubes. This is considered more permanent sterilization. I’ll explain the two differences as many people THINK they had the tubes removed, but in fact just had the tubal ligation: 1. *Tubal Ligation* - this is called getting your “tubes tied.” When you go to have a sterilization surgery, most of the time this is what they are doing. It involves cutting and/or cauterizing the tubes. It is effective, but now I’m learning it’s not nearly as effective as I was made to believe. Also, in the US, this is usually the sterilization procedure that insurance covers, if at all.  2. *Bilateral Salpingectomy* - Complete removal of the tubes. For sterilization, this procedure is often performed less, even though it’s much more effective and considered more “permanent.” After this, I started seeing just how common pregnancy after tubal ligation actually is (check the sterilization sub) and how I could have perhaps avoided this potentially life threatening situation if I had known about the other procedure.  What could have resulted in my death was not realizing I could be pregnant. I had never once been pregnant and was having weird pain. Because I had my “tubes tied” this possibility wasn’t on my mind and I waited longer than necessary to get help.  I share this because I want people to know the difference in the procedures (if you don’t already) and because I want people who have had tubal ligation and may be experiencing weird symptoms, to not rule out this possibility. Thanks for reading. Some may already know this, but in my research so far I have learned that many do not. I hope this helps someone.  TDLR: Got pregnant after tubal ligation (tubes tied) and have learned it’s actually not an effective method of sterilization. Almost died from an ectopic pregnancy, want to educate to prevent other deaths.  Edit: I’ve had a request to mention the sterilization sub. They offer resources to get approval for sterilization and doctors willing to perform the procedures. I hope this helps.","This poster requested and received permission to submit this PSA-style post, as an exception to Forum Rule #5: Posts Seek Advice, Comments Provide It.

gx1t5t,"We have been together with my boyfriend for almost 4 years now. From the very first days of our relationship anal sex came in the menu at his suggestion. It was a fairly new experience for me, but soon I realised how much I loved it and eventually it became my favorite sex act, giving me the strongest orgasms. We used to do it at least once a week, sometimes even more than that. Everything was going well until 1,5 years into the relationship, soon after we moved in together, we attempted to have anal sex again. I had just hopped out of the shower, but hadn't had time for proper preparation (not talking about enemas just simple cleaning with the help of a buttplug). Moments after he put it in he stopped, took it out and told me there was some ""debris"". He went to the bathroom to clean himself, and brought me some wipes. I was mortified; I froze there and was expecting to see his reaction. He told me it was ok, he still loved me, it happens. But then he just left me there. We didn't go back to having sex. I had to do the walk of shame to the bathroom alone, and then all was left was a very awkward silence. Let me explain one thing: When I started experimenting with anal I was very self-conscious, scared of the prospect of accidents etc. but once I started doing it, I stopped fretting that much and thought that if it happens it shouldn't be that big a deal; it comes with the territory and two consenting adults should be aware and cool with that. To be honest, I imagined that accidents like that might have happened already with my boyfriend or previous partners, but I believed that no one really cared enough to let me know and hurt my feelings. I learned not to care and just enjoy this mind-blowing experience. So back to the point. After the accident, my boyfriend, who previously adored anal sex, never touched my asshole again. I often suggested we tried again, but he would always brush it off, saying that he'd rather fuck my pussy instead. More than year had passed and I was certain the reason was that accident. I confronted him a couple of times about it, asked him bluntly why we stopped having anal sex and whether this was the reason and his response was that he wasn't thinking about it. \[For more context, in the meantime we developed a dead bedroom situation due to his anxiety regarding his performance, and we started seeing a couples therapist.\] I never bought his excuse and was convinced the reason was the accident. Then one day as we were talking about our sex life, he tells me the reason why he avoids butt play is because he is afraid his erection will not be strong enough to enter (he's a long-time stoner and this has taken a toll on the quality of his erection). I was surprised but I accepted his reasoning.  And then a week later, when the topic came up again, he comes and tells me that he lied. That he ""took the blame"" because he ""didn't want to hurt my feelings,"" but the truth was that he got turned off after the accident and doesn't want to have anal sex again. Needless to say I was mortified. I broke out to tears, not only because of the embarrassment, but also because of the lie. I felt betrayed and humiliated. And I was also so annoyed from the double standard. I am always the one who makes sure to be pristine clean in the relationship. He always praises how clean I am, and how I always smell nice and shower all the time. Whereas he keeps on farting stinky ones on my face, shitting with the door open, and I can't count the times I had to clean his explosive diarrhea from the toilet. Is it gross? Hell yeah. Do I care? I don't, because I love him and I know this is a normal human function. So his response to our accident really hurt my feelings. He keeps telling me he's not disgusted by me, he loves me and thinks I'm attractive, but he still won't have sex with me.  I don't know how to proceed now. Anal sex was one of the best things I could experience in life and it's been taken from me. What's more I feel like I've been scarred for life. I am horny all the time, but I feel so dirty and unworthy of sex. We've stopped therapy because our counsellor was not helping us at all, so now I feel like I'm completely alone in this. I understand the topic might be ridiculous but I really feel traumatised and would really appreciate some insight. Thank you all!","I say this as a guy who has tried anal and it's just not my thing, not because I'm scared of poop, I just don't like it:  it's ridiculous to freak out over finding poop inside an asshole. Obviously one will prepare for anal sex and try to prevent this from happening, but there is always a chance of it.",3647
gxwror,"I love playing with my boyfriend's penis even when it's not fully hard or we're ready to have sex. I love the warmth and the feeling of it growing. In my hands, in my mouth, anywhere! I love it on days when he's sporting a half it's so inviting to play with. I love how it fills me up, down there and in other places.  When I sometimes just wanna play with it and feel it guys don't realize how warm dynamic and fun it is.

gyo71a,"I just gave my boyfriend a blowjob for over an hour. I was getting so tired, jaw hurting, arm hurting. He was about to cum and pulled me back so he could edge himself - apparently he had been doing that this whole time! I had already orgasmed. I asked him why he pulled away and he smiled and said “because it feels so good”. His smile is cute but fuck i was kinda upset he had been edging himself. Is that not considered rude? What guy would give his gf oral for an additional 45 mins after he came?  I can’t even imagine asking him to do that to me (he probably would if I asked, but I personally wouldn’t feel OK asking that of someone).","You are 100% allowed to pull back and say ""I'm getting tired baby, time to come for me""",3260
gzkxit,"Porn makes it seem like squirters are worshipped by men, but it is actually quite the opposite. I have always been a squirter, simply cannot reach orgasm without squirting. But I've been so ashamed of it that it took me a long time to let myself cum for the first time. It may be true that squirt is pee, in that it is made up of similar stuff. But to me, they aren't the same - one makes my toes curl in ecstasy while the other doesn't. Nevertheless, whether I like it or not, my orgasm will always be associated with pee. It is something that makes me and several other women like me feel ashamed to orgasm with a partner, and often stop them before we reach orgasm. But what's worse is that I have actually been told not to orgasm by a few partners before. I acknowledge that it is a little taboo and not everyone is into it, and it's not their fault. But sex is a plane of life that can be very heterogeneous. Everyone likes different things and everyone functions differently - hence any kind of ideal held as ""normal"" which renders people who don't fit the ideal as abnormal is repressive, and this adds to the stigma around squirting.  It hurts me to see my partner move away from me when I orgasm, it makes me feel like I am disgusting in a moment that is supposed to be intimate, and when I feel most vulnerable. I wish I could just be held close and watched intently while I squirt - but guess I'm too gross for that shit.  Being a squirter sucks...","Someone said you should only sleep with men who are into it - good advice - but I think just a warning as things are moving to the bedroom might be in order. You can make your own flattering warning, here's one I made up: ""You make me really excited, I need to warn you that I squirt if a man can make me come."" If you frame it this way you might even get a man who's not usually into squirts to change his mind since he'll have proof that he's at least pretty good in bed: the evidence will be on his face and/or chest. :D",3137
h090ay,"So my bf (M in his late twenties) and I (F in midtwenties) have been dating for a while. When my bf was younger he used to go to the gym regularly and had a muscular body. Of course time went by and it became harder for him to maintain the same physical form. So he is still pretty strong but got kinda chubby in some areas like stomach and ass. And he's super insecure about it. What's more he's got quite a lot of hair on his chest and stomach which has been bothering him since his teenage years.  But tbh I love his body. Him having a ""dad bod"" type (though I hate the name) seems so hot to me, even hotter than before and I am really into that. Also I've got an average body but next to him I feel very feminine and delicate which really helps me to express my sexuality.  But every time I try to compliment him, touch him or tell him that I love his looks he eventually gets self-conscious and upset. He starts talking about his diet and exercises and how they don't help. How do I tell/show him I really love his current body and boost his self-esteem at the same time? UPD: thank you for so many kind words and recommendations. Maybe some people thought I didn't communicate with my SO enough but I constantly tell him the exact thing I wrote here. Really love seeing so many dad bod/father figure appreciation comments. Ofc if he wants to be fitter, he can do it, I am not stopping him from that. Just wanted to find some ways to express my love for his current appearance without looking or sounding like a douche. And I've read here some useful tips, thanks!","Dude here. Gained 30 pounds from job loss, job hunt, pandemic, etc. I run marathons and the extra weight is killing me on multiple levels. My awesome girlfriend loves my body, so I think maybe a similar situation as yours. Here's what's going through *my* head, which might help you understand what's going through his. Men's fitness very often ties the idea of being fit with moral superiority; strong will, capability, excellence. With this comes the idea, sort of baked in to fitness culture, that weight gain isn't a sign of stress response or a changed lifestyle that can be adapted for, but *moral weakness*. If being strong and trim makes me *more* of a man, then being weak and fat makes me *less* of one. It's false and unhealthy, of course, but it's easy to believe and reinforce when things are going well. When I look at myself in the mirror at this weight, it's like a body horror film. The weight makes my sport activities harder, It makes my clothes uncomfortable. It's not what I *ought* to look like. It's not what I want to look like. It's happening despite my efforts to stop it. For someone to tell me ""I love your body"" when my body looks horrifying to me just makes me notice more that **I** don't love my body. I know my girlfriend will love my trim runner body just as much this fall. I know that her attraction to this body is because she loves *me* and not the fat suit I'm wearing. But it's hard to remember that when we're in bed and I'm staring at the ceiling trying really hard not to freak out about having man titties, and she reaches over and pats my gut. I've had the same discussions you and your bf have had- she compliments me and I immediately bitch about breaking my diet and not getting out onto the trails, or wiping out my efforts with weekend pizza, or whatever. So, from this perspective, here's my advice. The dude is, probably, incapable of accepting compliments at this point, because he's wound up inside about how much he hates his body, because he's got some dysfunctonal ideas of the body as a representation of his moral character rather than an imperfect ally he can be kind to and work with. The best thing for him is probably to talk to a therapist, but the same ""I'm the only one in charge of things"" attitude that's causing him fitness problems may stop him from seeking help that way as well. Try to suggest it and see how it goes. The other option is to offer to support him. You don't want to be his gym manager or diet nanny, but if you can help him offload some chore-stress, or be in charge of food so you can cook and he can eat and have fewer ""I'll just buy takeout"" opportunities, or send him off on runs or gym mornings with a kiss or a blowjob or whatever, to make those 5am ""drag ass out of bed"" moments easier to push through, he should see it as support without accusation. **TL;DR** Nothing's going to convince him that dad bod is sexy, 'cause it's not sexy to *him*. Therapy will probably help. Being practically supportive of any healthy diet and exercise he's working on will also help.",2984
h79fi8,"Ok, so storytime. Was at my (f25) boyfriends (m25) house, and we were watching some random tv show while we were spooning. Got bored so I started sucking him off. I love doing that cause when he gets close he starts thrusting which turns me on so much I sometimes don't need foreplay. I edged him a few times and then we finally started having sex (sideways/spooning). So usually in this position he rubs my clitoris and gets me off once, sometimes two times in a row (Usually after that second time I tell him to stop, cause I get overwhelmed). But idk what clicked in me, so after the first orgasm I told him to please keep doing what he's doing with his hands, so the second orgasm came quickly but it was a little bit weaker than the first one. He stopped rubbing me and started thrusting in me harder, to which I told him that everything he does feels really amazing and that I never want him to stop. That probably sparked something in him, so he started rubbing my clit again while thrusting harder. The third orgasm was a vaginal one and it was amazing, I rarely get those, but when I do I appreciate them. So far that was my maximum in one session (never had 3 from piv like this time) but when he asked me should he stop, I told him please don't, so then he moved me on top of him, with my back on his chest. So the fourth one was the strongest. I've never felt this full body orgasm, I got chills and started shaking, lost control of my legs. By the time I came for the fifth time I literally started crying and again my legs were shaking even more.  He told me he can't hold it anymore so he came seconds after my fifth orgasm. After we were done I was shaking and my head hurt but damn it was worth it. This happened for the first time for me, so now I wonder, ladies what can I do to have this multiple orgasms more often? I sometimes read about women having 10+ orgasms in a row so how do you cope with it? I felt like I was about to faint after the fifth one. Also, how do I get more of those intense full body orgasms? P.s. he was so proud and the look on his face was the cutest thing I ever saw.",marry him,2834
h83sy2,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit to post this on but I’m going to post it anyways  So almost a year ago one of my bras went missing. I didn’t give it much thought and eventually forgot about it. Well, over the course of this year another bra, three panties, a thong and a bikini top have gone missing. I started to get worried someone had broken into our house. I forgot about my missing underwear and for a couple of months nothing else disappeared. That was until a few weeks ago when my mom mentioned to me that she couldn’t find two of her bras. Fast forward to two days ago and I’m in my brothers room looking for batteries for my tv remote. He has this large cardboard box under his bed where he keeps random stuff so I figured he could have some batteries there. As you can probably guess, I did not find batteries but instead found a bunch of women’s underwear. I immediately recognized my red bra that went missing almost a year ago, as well as my black bra that disappeared a few months ago. I didn’t want to assume what he did with my underwear but the questionable stains on my bras spoke for themselves. My red bra was covered in stains both on the inside and outside of the cups. My other bra had some stains but they weren’t as bad as the red one. My panties didn’t look stained, but my Calvin Klein thong that had gone missing about 6 months ago was disgusting. It was crusty and smelled terrible. I also found my mom’s two bras, a black one and a grey one. The black one had a lot of stains in the outside of the cups and the grey one didn’t look like it had any. But what I found the most disgusting was my 9 year old sister’s trainer bra. It had the most stains out of anything in his box. The bra had huge yellow stains on both sides of it. I’m not even lying I almost puked. I could still see some white on the bra but most of it was yellow from what I can only assume is my brother’s discharge. I put the stuff back in the box and left his room fast. I haven’t told anyone about this because I don’t know how to approach it. My brother is 17 turning 18 this July and I’m 16. What I’m asking is how I can tell my mom about this without affecting our relationship as a family.","Everyone is just saying tell your parents, without realizing your question was not ""if"" you should tell but ""how"". Tell your mom you need to talk to her in private about something very important and very uncomfortable. Tell her everything you wrote here-- you might even just open this up on your phone and read what you already wrote aloud if you're too nervous. Make sure you communicate your worries re: your little sister's safety. Do not tell your sister what happened to her training bra. Do not confront your brother. Those are both jobs to be handled by your parent(s). This will suck, but it's for the best. The only way for this wound to be healed is to uncover it and address it directly.",6079
h8nxwm,"My ex (24M) told me (21F) in January he wanted to try being polyamorous. I wasn’t really okay with it but didn’t want to lose him so said I was willing to let him try it, with a couple ground rules (eg. safe sex with others, communication, etc). In March he went to our friend’s (29F) place to watch a few movies, and ended up crashing there after drinking too much. From what he told me they had sex around 3-4am. He got home while I was at work that morning/early afternoon. Since she was my friend I honestly didn’t think anything would have happened between them. Him and I had unprotected sex later that night, which was not uncommon for us, we’d been together for a few years and I have an IUD.  I didn’t know until over a week later that they’d had unprotected sex at all, let alone just earlier the same day. By the time I found out, it was mid-March so all the clinics nearby had closed for everything but emergencies, so I couldn’t even get tested or anything. It’s been a couple months now and I still get really freaked out thinking about it. The fact that I had no idea, that they not only didn’t tell me but made some effort to hide it from me...I guess I felt/feel super violated by the whole thing, I dunno. Thoughts?  Edit because people are DMing me to “have respect for myself and dump him” - the first two words in this literally label him my ex, so that issue has been already been taken care of! Thanks for that though! ❤️  Also, most of your comments are amazing I’m trying to read them all right now, thank you everyone!! Edit #2 - polyamory is a valid lifestyle, and completely separate from being a shitty person or a cheater. For those of you saying I should’ve seen it coming when he told me he wanted to be polyam, I did my research about it when he told me. We had a set of boundaries/ground rules (like any relationship should) and he broke those. That makes him shitty, polyamory had nothing to do with it.","You're very justified in feeling this way. What people fail to realize is that polyamory is not the same as an open relationship. With polyamory, all involved parties know, and feel affection for eachother. It doesn't mean he just sleeps with whoever so long as the conditions are met. The fact that he didn't tell you about the sex, and that he failed to use protection is nothing but disrespectful. It seems to me that he doesn't truly care about your feelings on the matters so long as he gets what he wants. You need to put your foot down about this, or else he'll absolutely run wild with it. Honestly I feel as though you should sit down, and reevaluate whether or not this is a man you want to be with. A man who uses polyamory as an excuse to sleep around, doesn't follow agreements, and hides things from you. Edit: I apologize for my lack of proper understanding regarding poly relationships. I was merely repeating what a friend had informed me the definition was, but now it appears I have some research to do. Thank you everyone for setting me straight",2121

hbhtww,"I know most submissive women, like myself, love to be told to go down, or make a big deal and a ritual of it, and it feels like you're at his command and servicing him and all that.

I know guys who would love to talk about it but don't because they expect to be shamed.  It also really doesn't make sense that it's considered submissive all the time because the act can be seen as like super dominant, right? You've got the other person's entire pleasure under your control. And honestly, for blowjobs, you have his most sensitive part millimeters away from a powerful jaw, lol. How can that be considered submissive and weak?!  When I'm tied up and blindfolded and just waiting for him to go down on me and have a feast, I don't think I ever feel dominant lol. I feel like a toy or a snack that's completely his to enjoy.  It made me think that we shouldn't always see oral as submission or something one does to another person but as another intimate act where there's lots of different aspects of power dynamics. It's not always one being powerful over the other. What do you all think? Is that a healthier way of thinking about it?","I’ve never seen it as dominance or submissive.  I’m pleasuring my partner, and enjoying every minute of it.  They have said that they feel the same way when they pleasure me.

hd0gev,"In advance english is not my first language, and medical terms are difficult, so sorry if i use some words wrong.  And i didnt find anywhere else to post this I(20F) had cancer when I was 2 years old. I had a tumor on my vagina. It was removed with radiation, and left the skin around the opening damaged. It was thight and hard. I could bearly get a tampon in and sex was not possible at all. When I was 17 i finally had the tissue removed, and I could have sex for the first time. And omg my life changed. But the result of the surgery left my vagina without inner lips. Its like just a hole. It does not look normal. Even tho everybody is different, it still looks weird. Even my doctor was questioning me why it looked that way. So today I made the first step to get it normal. I booked an consult with a plastic surgeon, and im hoping to finally have a normal vagina. I just need to share this with someone, and if anyone have had vaginal surgery, please share your story. Edit: Omg you guys are amazing! The post has really blown up, and thank you for all the love. I want to adress that I am not doing this to have it look like a porn pussy. I have always wanted to do this after my first surgery, because the result was not as i tought it would look.  I know im young to, but this is also to make life better for me. Both my daily life and my sexlife. Thank you again for all the love and good lucks!","I've never interacted with anyone that has such a similar story to me. I got diagnosed with vaginal cancer at 18 months old and the scar tissue from radiation also caused problems for me as I got older, like not even being able to use a tampon. My doctor put me on birth control hoping that the estrogen would soften the scar tissue and that seems to be working. I may need to get a surgery in the future, so it's really nice to hear that you already had a successful surgery functionality-wise. I just wanted to say thank you for sharing your experience and good luck with your upcoming surgery!",1843

I know vasectomies are considered permanent, and that getting it reversed isn’t something you should ever plan on, but it seems like a no brainer to store a bunch of sperm samples at a sperm bank (sperm stays alive and healthy for an almost indefinite amount of time when frozen properly), get the vasectomy (which is not only the most effective form of birth control, but it is inexpensive, takes 10-15 minutes to have done, and has no side effects), and then when the time comes that I want kids, just use the frozen sperm.  I know this sounds crazy, but honestly, is it?  Is there some major downside that I’m not considering? Edit: thanks for all the insight. I just wanted to know the downsides of this and I see now that there are plenty. Back to the drawing board I suppose. Edit 2: I feel it’s important to mention that my primary motivation behind this post was to learn about the potential consequences so I can make a well-informed decision. Obviously there’s way too many issues with this plan for it to be worth doing. I didn’t realize the toll that an IVF has on a woman. This whole idea was not just for my own enjoyment of my sex life, but also to explore ways for my partner to not have to deal with nasty birth control side effects. I’d give anything for a working male birth control.","I think you aren't considering the potential downsides for a potential future partner who wants to have kids with you. Now instead of trying by stopping birth control, she has to undergo fertility monitoring and insemination medically (perhaps using fertility drugs to control ovulation) which is time consuming, potentially uncomfortable, and expensive (may not be covered by insurance at all). Just a thought to consider.",2806
hgarsy,"I love being given directions and I love to embrace the feelings of being owned, used, etc., so I definitely consider myself deeply submissive. But a couple of past relationships with the macho, aggressive, rough sex, kinda boyfriends left me feeling unexcited and frankly just a bit uncomfortable.  Until I met my current boyfriend, I didn't stop to think that it doesn't have to be this way. I wonder if what I like makes sense or is contradictory and where exactly does this come from? I've had a stable home life growing up, and nothing really to escape from or get out of. So what exactly do I mean? I'm talking about how he can be very calm and quiet, but still have that fiery intensity behind his eyes, words, and actions. Sometimes, he walks up to me, letting his hands roam all over, slowly but surely, and he doesn't have to say a word but I find myself melting just at how he does it. Little actions like putting a finger on my lips to stop me from speaking, or keeping my hands restricted subtly while he embraces me. It's, shall I say, surprisingly hot?  And then there's all the non-verbal cues he seems to have a complete mastery on. I sometimes feel he just needs to be resting in a certain way on his chair with a drink, and just snap his fingers, and I know at the bottom of my heart he wants me to come up to him and service him. I don't know how I know, but there's this quiet connection you know? And just a little smirk from him is enough to convince me that he can read me mind and know exactly how wet I'm getting. I guess for the first time in my life I've had a relationship that feels deeper and connected than ever before and it's kind of got me thinking a lot about what I thought I knew about sex and relationships and kink. Who else here can relate to that, and who else has wondered why can someone find something so subtle so appealing and possibly more powerful than overt displays of power or aggression?","Loud and scary says ""I am going to make you mine!!!"" Calm and in control says ""You and I both know you're already mine.""",2608
hh2hkx,"PSA: Clean your apartment before you bring someone over for sex. It is just as important as washing your dick. Simple things like putting away your dirty laundry, making your bed and putting the toilet seat down will put your date at ease and show that your actually respect your space and your things. It will also probably increase your chances that they’ll want to see you again and come back to your place in the future.  I was reflecting on some of my past dating and sexual experiences and just remembered this guy who I thought was such a wonderful match for me. We were compatible on every level, especially sexually. But I ended things because he kept his apartment in such bad shape. One time after sex I go the the bathroom to pee and clean up and after turning the light on I was in horror. Absolute complete horror. Toilet seat left up with mysterious stains on it (probably piss, etc) counter top was covered in a mess of products, dust and other gross things. Toothpaste stains everywhere. I don’t think he had changed his toothbrush on well over a year because it was doing that thing where the bristles are all splayed out and flat. The tub was dingy af and the shower curtain had mildew. I don’t even remember if I peed because I was just so grossed out. His bedroom was no better... the first time I went over I remember being embarrassed for him. But he was so non-chalant! He casually picked up dirty underwear that was lying on his unmade bed. There were clothes everywhere, books, papers, dust and random stuff all over his dresser, broken Xbox on the floor. It was such a mind fuck for me because on our dates he was so well put together and well groomed. Each time I went to his place I tried to convince myself that maybe he had a long week and didn’t get a chance to tidy up to give him the benefit of the doubt. After being at his place on three occasions I knew I had to end it. I couldn’t keep having sex with him (especially at his place) because I was so anxious about the mess and paranoid about bacteria and stuff. Sorry if this post sounds rude but please please please don’t bring people over for sex if your place is a mess! It’s just common courtesy. Edit: I’m really happy to see that this has gotten quite a reach because I think this is an important issue that can have long term effects in relationships and marriages. There’s a clear divide in the comments between people who are ok with this type of situation and those who are not. To each their own. This experience is not limited to heterosexual relationships, it can affect anyone. Some people seem like they are feeling hurt or attacked here but maybe it's an opportunity for self evaluation. We're all a work in progress. To the responses that intended to shame or criticize me for deciding to end things, please consider reading this article: [She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes by the Sink](https://mustbethistalltoride.com/2016/01/14/she-divorced-me-because-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink/). Additionally, it may have been a short fling but I still had respect for this person and did not end things in a malicious or insensitive way. There are so many superficial reasons why people break up (especially due to physical appearance) that are not as heavily criticized and are deemed ok because, hey, preferences right? I know there are a few comments about the mental health of this person being a potential reason as to why they could not perform proper housekeeping for themselves. This is valid. I do think there may have been a deeper issue present but it was my personal choice to opt out of doing the emotional and mental labour to work through that with them. I chose to prioritize my own mental health and remove myself from the situation. And for clarification, cleaning your genitals is just as important as cleaning your living space.

hhg31f,"For years, I’ve been struggling to understand what women mean when they say you should use one or two fingers to do a come hither motion. I thought this involved curling and uncurling your fingers while they’re inside of your partner, but that technique is ineffective and painful for some vagina owners. So people - take one to two fingers and keep them stiff and straight pointing the entire time (also keep them together, don’t spread them) and essentially do an upward tapping motion. The motion looks kind of like when there’s a bank robbery in a movie, and you see the clerk tapping the alarm button under the counter. Hope this helps!

hl4n5a,"Hi everyone,  I’m a 22 year old female and my boyfriend is 27. We’ve been dating for about a year and a half. I’ve picked up on hints that he likes to be dominated but I would say we’re both switches. A couple nights ago, we were trying out some new toys and were both a little high on some good old legal THC. I was riding him and he kept trying to make me slow down so I looked down and teased him because he was being a bad boy. And it sort of escalated from there. I called him a good boy multiple times, made him beg and ask for permission to cum, told him he was my little fuck toy and that his dick was mine to use.  I have never cum from penetration only, just clit stimulation preferably with a vibrator plus penetration. I found myself genuinely cumming two times while riding him and calling him a good boy and hearing him moan so loud and reciprocate that dirty talk. Like seeing him get so into it was exhilarating.   My legs were turned jelly and I was done by the time I told him he could cum. I have no idea how to navigate this kink or what to call it.  I also have no idea how to be more dominant without riding him. Riding him for an hour plus kills my legs. If anyone has ideas or guidance I would love it thank you. Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented or reached out! My boyfriend has been overwhelmingly happy that so many people share this kink. But, please don’t send me any more dick pics or requests to fuck. It’s inappropriate and gross. Thank you.",You don't have to be on top to be dominant.

It also makes me really frustrated to see people who are so much younger than me feeling insecure about being virgins at 18-19, even people going so far as to ask if they should hire an escort just so they can lose it and not feel bad about it anymore.

hz2uv4,"This is going to be a little long but I hope its worth the read. I've only been sexually active for about 2 years. I had my first gynecologist visit about a year and a half ago, but with everything going on in the world right now I've been putting off returning. For this past year and a half, I've been dealing with something that I've felt extremely embarrassed and insecure about. During my first gyno visit, she discovered I had BV, bacterial vaginosis. She explained the symptoms to me and prescribed me antibiotics. Since then, BV has been reoccurring. Non. Freaking. Stop. Within weeks of finishing my antibiotics, the symptoms would start. I've done 3 rounds of antibiotics since the first visit. I confided in a friend about it and their response was extremely hurtful. They basically called me gross and said that something was wrong with me, because they've never had that problem. It really tore me up inside and only made all my insecurity a million times worse. So needless to say, when I went to my gynecologist visit today, my anxiety was through the roof. When she came in to meet with me, I just... broke. I started venting and crying, like a lot. This has severely impacted my self esteem, and my sex life has suffered at times because of it all. It all just started pouring out and I couldn't stop. I felt so ashamed and overwhelmed. I had an irrational fear that she would react the same way my friend did. My gynecologist was amazing. She listened intently, not interrupting. When I was done she asked me some questions not only about my symptoms but about my mental health and personal things I'd shared with her. She comforted me with so many kind words and reassurances. She told me she has many patients who have recurring BV and that she wishes I'd felt comfortable enough to come in and have this discussion with her sooner, because there is absolutely nothing wrong with me. She helped me identify and locate a specific pro-biotic to start taking. She told me to stop using scented soap and not to clean my nether regions as intensely as I have been. She recommended that after activities which leave me sweaty to change underwear and dry any damp areas. She also discouraged any feminine washes like Vagisil. After that, she did my exam, comforting me by confirming once more that there was in fact nothing wrong with me or my vagina. When everything was done, she parted with a few more closing words and told me not to hesitate to call or come in if I had any other concerns. I left feeling like this massive burden I've been carrying for the past nearly 2 years has finally been lifted. I was so grateful to have such a kind, empathetic doctor who actually listened to me and truly understood how difficult this has been. I've heard so many horror stories and complaints regarding doctors who seemingly don't care about their patients or don't handle certain situations well. So I'm here to tell you that if your doctor or gynecologist does not treat you with dignity, respect, and kindness, please know that better service is out there and you deserve it. I wish everyone could have the wonderful experience I had today. Edit: I just want to say thank you everyone for all the kind comments and messages. It's been really uplifting to hear everyone's stories and words of advice/encouragement.

I got horny sorts looking at them a few times and it did wonders for my self confidence and I now hate them a bit less.  Does anybody else feel this way? Disclaimer: using a friend's throwaway so my DMs don't get bombed with weird messages, sort of sad that happens but I'll respond to the comments on my own! Edit: God, people get a grip, this is why women call guys creeps. It's been ten minutes and I've already got my friend texting me about the DMs on the lines of *can I see what's turning you on * from guys. WTF man?","Yeah, I do. It’s a combo of   a) tits are great   b) seeing ourselves through the eyes of our prospective sexual partners-this is especially common for women because the female firm is so widely sexualised   c) they are a source of sexual pleasure for me and so they have a mental association with that  and d) turns out I was bi and I really like tits, see comment a",1364
i00msr,"I’m a straight cis man and I’ve struggled with this topic as it’s been circling on social media lately and the other day I was asked point blank “are you attracted to trans women?”, they were not happy with my answer. Here is my thinking currently(please read the whole thing before replying):  If your reasoning for not dating a trans person is BECAUSE they are trans then that is transphobia, in theory you should be willing to date anyone you like and are attracted to and there shouldn’t be any labels that prevent that because who knows I may eventually meet a trans woman who is perfect for me, so just saying no to the possibility period is transphobic.  BUT sexual preferences do exist, and as pro LGBTQ+ as I or anyone else are it cannot be argued that a trans woman is the same .period. as a cis woman. It just can’t. Please don’t try because until gene editing exists to the point we can actively morph physiology I reject the idea. There are physical differences whether someone chooses to acknowledge them or not. And those differences are subject to sexual preference. The main one being; as an inherent quality to being a trans woman a person is either pre or post op, both of which I must admit I am not attracted to. I’m not saying it’s impossible, it’s possible I meet a trans woman that blows me away so much that I forget all that and it doesn’t wind up mattering, I’m open to the fact that it’s not impossible, but theres a preference that exists and influences my decisions subconsciously whether I like it or not.  I struggle with this because I know it is technically discriminatory, but my question is if this is transphobic then where does it end? Am I homophobic for expressing that I am not sexually attracted to men? Am I racist for saying that, on average, I find generally find myself attracted to more women of my own race than others? Fatphobic for not generally being attracted to the morbidly obese? Is it discriminatory to say I like blondes? What if, at an undetectable level outside of thorough testing, I am slightly more attracted to people who smell closer to cinnamon than to clove? IMO these questions really get into the basis of how sexuality is formed and what power we have over it. Is my attraction to blondes innate or molded over time? I’ve made no conscious decision to be attracted to blondes so is it moral to criticize me personally for something I largely had and have no control over? If we find it’s a combination of innate and learned behavior is it morally ethical to “correct” a persons natural attractions to be more equitable or to demand they change them themselves? Who gets to decide what is “correct”, based on what factors? It doesn’t seem to work too well on gay men in those conversation camps, which are certainly not moral.  The common thread I think I’ve picked up on as to what is phobic and what isnt is the degree to which a preference is biologically ingrained vs societally molded. But the problem is: we really have no clue to what degree most things in sexuality are natural vs nurture, so how can we possibly fairly assign bigotry to one preference vs another? Why do some societally molded sexual preferences get a pass and others are vilified? Why are some objectively natural preferences considered “wrong”? Even if after this whole post the answer returned is a resounding “yes you are transphobic” ...wtf am I supposed to do? I can’t force myself to change the preference, I’m not going to lie just to appease the crowd or to disillusion myself, I’m not going to force myself into things I’m uncomfortable with to try to “get over it”. If I admit that it exists and that it isn’t ideal and we should do our best as a society to stop influencing sexuality... what more can possibly be expected? Am I doomed to be ridiculed for something I didn’t choose and can’t really change for the rest of my life?  Sorry for the long post and apologies to anyone I’ve offended. I would appreciate any thoughts, but please try to teach rather than be cruel, I genuinely want to learn. Thank you EDIT——————————— First of all thank you for the discussion, I honestly got way more out of this then I expected and learned quite a bit. Apologies if I missed your comment or forgot to reply, I started to get buried faster than I could read. So what did I learn... Well honestly I feel a bit odd about what I believe I’ve discovered about my reasoning because it isn’t what I expected. As people asked me to explain my reasoning for not wanting to engage sexually with a trans woman(beyond not liking dicks, which I learned is called genital preference. Duh) I found myself always back to the point that I just am not comfortable that the genitalia are surgically created. I don’t feel that they’re still masculine, I don’t have a problem validating them as women, I don’t have a problem respecting them as the people they want to be, I don’t really think about the fact a penis was once there, I just.... don’t like that the post-op vagina(I also learned that the term pre-op can be considered offensive) is surgically created. But why? Well I realized that I feel the same way about this as I feel about shaking hands with someone missing a finger, or looking at a large surgical scar, etc. I’m uncomfortable around surgical abnormalities(for lack of a better word) even if they’re completely healed over like say an amputated limb, I just don’t want to touch it as bad as that sounds. I don’t outwardly treat anyone who has something like this differently, I certainly have no bias against them, I’m just a bit squeamish I guess? Obviously this brings up a whole host of new potentially problematic issues and I’m not sure this is any better of an answer than the one I gave before, but I genuinely believe that’s the biggest factor. I’m curious to hear thoughts on this.  Overall I learned that most rational people won’t hold it against me so long as I just give a polite “im sorry I’m not interested” when approached or a “I haven’t met any that I’m interested in yet” when asked directly how I feel about my interest in trans women. These are probably the answers I’ll give rather than explaining my actual weird reasoning.   Some other things I gathered that may be useful: It is only ____phobic if you give a non-negotiable statement regarding your preference, such as “I will never be attracted to any ____. Period.” Much like scientists cannot technically prove things as facts they can only gather evidence that supports the theory, to say that you will never find yourself sexually attracted to something is disingenuous because you simply cannot know that. Instead it’s more truthful to say “I have never found myself attracted to ____, and I find it unlikely(though not impossible) that I will given my preference for/against ____”","Okay, folks.  This has been a really good conversation.  As is always the case with this topic, we've had to deal with some transphobes, and as is also always the case, we get more as the topic hangs around. We're past the time for the mods to be able to babysit, and with things getting uglier, we are now locking this topic.  Thanks to all who discussed this in a respectful, constructive manner.",4805
i27grf,"My husband and I have had a very trying sex life over the past few years. I chronically get horrible BV and yeast infections after we have sex... every time.  I’ve been to see multiple OB/GYNs and they all recommend the same things (wash/clean beforehand, pee straight afterwards - both of which are awesome mood killers BTW, only wear cotton panties, low sugar diets, etc etc etc.)  It’s gotten to be that I don’t ever want to have sex because I know what’s coming the next day and my husband feels like it’s his fault and that he’s “unclean”.   This past week was our anniversary and we went away for a few nights. I forgot to pack lube...and I miraculously didn’t get an infection for the first time in...6 years!?!?  Came home this week, had sex and got a yeast infection and something suddenly clicked. A quick google search confirmed it. Most common lubricants (cough KY) contain glycerin which is basically sugar. HOW HAS NO DOCTOR EVER TOLD ME OR RECOMMENDED THIS!?!?","Yup! > [**6 Lube Ingredients You Might Not Want to Put in Your Vagina**](https://www.self.com/story/6-lube-ingredients-to-avoid) > If you’ve experienced discomfort with some lubes in the past, or just want to play it ultra-safe, here are six lube ingredients you should know about and potentially avoid. > **1. Glycerin** > Glycerin is a humectant (meaning it helps to retain moisture) that shows up in a lot of lubes, especially ones that are flavored or warming. Although those special effects can be intriguing, your vagina might struggle when it comes into contact with glycerin. > “Glycerin is a metabolic byproduct of sugar, which can serve as food source for microbes,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, M.D., board-certified ob/gyn and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Vista East Medical Center in Waukegan, Illinois, tells SELF. > In particular, glycerin may contribute to an overgrowth of yeast, which can then cause yeast infections. “That doesn’t mean everyone who uses a glycerin-containing lubricant is going to get a yeast infection, but if you’re already prone to them, glycerin may be an ingredient you may want to stay away from,” Dweck says. That's a good article. I don't know why stuff like this isn't more widely known. We've used virgin coconut oil for years – decades, actually – and I've never had a problem. It's compatible with vaginal pH and has mild antifungal properties. Plus, it feels, smells, and tastes good, and it's a great massage oil for those full-body sessions! Just don't buy refined coconut oil and don't use any oil with latex or polyisoprene condoms.",4313
i2q3pb,"Don’t.   The person you’re having sex with isn’t just a vessel for your pleasure. They are a person who has consented to sex with protection. Once you betray that understanding, the act is no longer consensual.   Every single one of my friends have experienced stealthing and I just want to understand how can men can be so callous. You’re risking your health and the health of your partners just cause it doesn’t feel as good? A moment of satisfaction for you while she feels a gut-wrenching panic, the anxious reach with every future partner just in case they decide to be as selfish as you?   Please, be responsible. Whether it’s a one night stand or a relationship, every person you sleep with deserves to feel safe.   **Edit:** Wow I really wasn’t expecting this to reach so many people. Some things I want to clarify:   To those that have experienced this, of all genders, I’m so sorry. I only specified men in my post because it’s relevant to my experience, not to say that only men are capable of this violation.  To those that say, “Well duh, I would never do that” I’m glad you are respectful of your partners boundaries. Please hold people accountable if you hear them talk about it casually cause that’s how complacency harms. And no, this doesn’t just happen to people who hook up with strangers (even if it did, that’s no excuse for rape)  it also happens in relationships, with people you thought you could trust.   To those that bring up the way that women lie about taking birth control pills, I hear you. That is also a violation of trust and is completely intolerable. However, it comes across as insensitive when you enter a space that is specifically addressing ones trauma and use it as an opportunity to twist the narrative. Similar to the argument, “men get raped too!” when a woman comes forward. Yes, no one is denying that fact, but you need to ask yourself why this is the moment you choose to address it. Is it out of defensiveness? Is it out of genuine concern? Is it to win a debate? Do you take the time to advocate outside of these perimeters? Just something to consider.  Thank you all for your openness, I hope that you found some catharsis in sharing.","I totally was reading this in such a naïve way.  I thought you meant taking it off AFTER finishing.  I was thinking that yeah, a moment of cuddling or something instead of rushing to get rid of the condom and clean up.   Do people actually do this?  Wow, I just can't even imagine that level of selfishness.  Or stupidity, I'd definitely consider any amount of physical retribution as acceptable to get out of this situation.  I'd try to rare back and kick them in the balls, if only to assure that they would lose their boner and give time to escape.   At what point is that rape?  You consented to sex within certain parameters, such as it being done with protection.  Just because I wanted to have sex with you doesn't mean you can suddenly change that!",2378
i4aybj,"This is a group almost work like type setting; I was joking and roughhousing (karate arms and terribly fake kicks etc) with a newly acquired friend of mine and our jokes escalated into things like “I’m gonna beat you up” etc and then to “I’m gonna choke you out” back and forth and so he playfully puts his arms around my neck and stuff and it’s funny.   And then one time he really does choke me a little bit hard and he’s staring right into my eyes and I choke him back and then he lets go and walks off and.... o___o it was so hot I can’t stop thinking about it.   I saw him a few days later and we joked around and he said “I bet you can’t even fit your hands around my neck” and so I tried and couldn’t and slightly squeezed and he said “harder” so I did it harder and then we exchanged a couple jabs and laughed and walked our separate  ways but... omg.. it seemed casual and friendly at the time but the longer I think about it the more incredibly sexually charged both interactions seemed now.     Also I’m also feeling kind of weird because I have a bf of 8 years that I’ve been with since I was 16 and lost my virginity to. He’s choked me in bed before since I’ve asked before but it doesn’t really feel like it’s because HE wants to, and he definitely doesn’t like being choked.    I wouldn’t break up over sex it just makes me feel like there’s so much I haven’t experienced, and he’s paid for camgirls in the past which makes me feel unwanted, and idk I’ve been thinking about the choke for the last two days now and maybe I’m realizing I haven’t felt desired by him in any way like that in a long time.    Tl;dr I got playfully choked and it made me feel really good in a lot of ways. It’s almost kind of making me question if picking one sexual partner at 16 is actually a sane decision that can be carried out through entire adulthood","I could easily see this comment section turning into a debate on the merits of monogamy, but in reality I don't see how such a discussion would do you any good. The best advice here would be to talk to your partner. Convey your feelings through meaningful conversation. Also, keep in mind that the framing and context of this conversation will be important (Starting with ""My friend choked me the other day and it turned me on and I don't remember the last time you made me feel wanted"" probably isn't the best). Make the tone of the conversation more of an honest confession of your feelings with a focus on how you want to improve your sexual health (or even intimacy in general, since you haven't felt desired) with your partner. It's not a fight or argument. If you're wanting new sexual experiences, maybe even suggest trying new things together? Change up positions. Try new locations. Lingerie? Hopefully, your partner will have some feedback of their own to add. Best of luck.",2898
i5qg8o,"Okay, as someone from Norway, I am asking a genuine question here. Why are Americans so incredibly weird and invasive over their kids sex lives?  I read posts from older (Older referring to at the age of consent) teens having to get it on in the car or an abandoned building because their parents won’t allow them to have sex in their rooms. I’ve also read comments from parents who despise the idea of their kid even having sex at all. It’s the strangest thing I have ever seen. I understand being scared of pregnancy but with birth control AND condoms, pregnancy is extremely EXTREMELY unlikely to happen. We promote safe sex here in Norway and teens have access to condoms in school.  In Norway, when you’re 16+, your parents allow you to take your partner in your room. Here we believe everyone has the right to privacy. Your room is your room. Everyone has access to condoms and contraceptives. Sex education is taught early on. We have one of the lowest teen pregnancy rates in the world while America has one of the highest. I think the strictness of many American parents contributes to that. What’s ironic is that in most American states, the age of consent is 16. That’s also the average age of consent in most of the world. Meanwhile statistics showed the average age to lose your virginity is 17 worldwide. Now that you have this knowledge, I hope some of you know how incredibly ridiculous you sound if you think your older teens (16-19) are going to stop having sex (If they are) just because you disapprove & want to put a stop to it. I just can’t believe you have to sneak around to have sex over there. Like... Why?! The things I read surprise me sometimes. I always thought the USA was pretty progressive.  And for those of you who have to get intimate in cars, or forests, or whatever else.. WATCH YOUR SURROUNDINGS ALWAYS. Voyeur porn is a real and serious thing. People record you and upload you to various porn sites. Then it gets reposted & shared to other communities.","HA I'm 24 and my partner of 2 years still has to sleep on the couch when he comes over, and I'm not allowed to close my door.

I am so lucky to have him and I just want to let you all know how amazing the perfect partner can be.

i8m4cf,"This is a throwaway because the guy knows I‘m on reddit. So I (23F) met this guy (26M) through Reddit like two months ago and we both noticed that we live very close to each other. After two months talking almost every day, we had two dates and then I asked him to come to my house to watch a movie. We started kissing and fooling around and when we were both naked he tried to go inside without a condom and I closed my legs quickly. He asked what’s wrong and told him that I have condoms in my nightstand. He said that he doesn’t do condoms and I said that I wasn’t on Birth Control. Then he told me that I was hugely irresponsible and selfish for not being on BC and because I was expecting him to sacrifice his pleasure putting a condom on. That he was very good and pulling out and I had to trust him. I’ve never had unprotected sex and I’ve always used condoms with my partners (ex boyfriend, FWB; fuck buddy) because I’m not comfortable with going raw and pulling out.  Well I insisted on using a condom and then he said that he’d rather just masturbate at home. So he put his clothes back on and left my house. I feel very hurt and confused. Is it really that bad to ask for a condom? Or should I get on birth control to avoid this kind of problems?

i91916,"I am pasting my response to a post from the other day because I've seen enough posts about bad vaginal odors and so much misconception regarding the cause: &#x200B; I have to answer you even though I'm late to the party.  I never had a problem with any fishy odor until my husband and I started having sex. Everyone screams BV...I worked many years as a clinical laboratory scientist exclusively in Microbiology.  I thought that I did have BV simply bc of the distinctive smell.  Well, I didn't, because I had NO symptoms of BV except odor...but what I ***did*** have was a chemical reaction going on when my husband's semen got inside of me. The bacteria that cause BV (Gardnerella vaginalis) are part of the normal flora in women.  When a woman's vagina becomes off balance (pH), the normal flora gets replaced with increased amounts of Gardnerella, among other bacteria not usually part of the vaginal flora.  All women have Gardnerella in their vagina.  When we would do an external slide test from a vaginal swab, if a woman has BV, a drop of KOH on the slide (a wet mount made from a swab of her vagina) would produce an overwhelming fishy odor (called the ""Whiff test"").  I'm thinking that there is a substance in semen that creates this same result.     The solution?  Quit ejaculating inside of her vagina, or wear a condom. This was the only thing that worked.  No amount of washing or douching would take the odor away. None.  It just literally had to wear off, for lack of a better word.","When I had read about semen’s alkane and a vagina’s acidic nature, and the chaos that ensues when the two meet, my first thought was “Man, Nature be a cruel ass hating bitch”.",1914
i9u4cs,"I'm 22F and he's 20M, both in college. We've been talking to each other for awhile and within the last month or two, our texting has gotten pretty sexual. We exchanged nudes and sexted all the time and my self confidence has never been higher!  I've been sexually active since I was 15 but only ever had sex with two long term (2+ years) partners, but have fooled around plenty. He's a stereotypical frat boy and considers himself a self-proclaimed sex god. Okay, he's cocky. Maybe there's some truth to it? I thought. We agreed to start a FWB thing and I drove two hours to go see him last night. I arrived at his building and he took me to his room and I was really nervous so he just kissed me, which was nice. But he was probably one of the worse kissers I've experienced. Tongue immediately down my throat, little lip movement. Within a few seconds of us making out he starts rubbing my cooch like it's sandpaper and he has a woodshop project due tomorrow. Okay, whatever, not many guys are good at fingering. He takes off my pants. This is less than 5 minutes in, so I'm still trying to get turned on. He immediately divebombs two fingers into my vagina and starts jackhammering away and playing with my clit like it's a turntable. I tell him, in the nicest, sexiest way possible, ""hey there, eaaaasy. Do it like this."" and I show him how I like it but he doesn't really give a fuck and just continues playing DJ on my clit and jackhammering away at my vagina. Bonus: his nails aren't clipped and I can feel it.  I decide to go down on him since it's something we've talked about. Now folks, one thing I \*will\* brag about is that my blowjob game is good. I made a boy post-orgasm weep tears of joy before and he raved about it to our friends for some reason. I know I'm good, it's my specialty. But one thing I, nor 99% of women don't like, is having our head violently pushed down without warning as soon as you start. It's been awhile for me and there's a learning curve with every new penis you encounter, correct? I was still trying to get the hang of the vibe but he immediately crushes my skull down the entire length his average dick and then goes ""can you use less teeth?"" Motherfucker. Fine. I don't use my mouth and just lick it and use hands instead like he instructed. Okay, fine. We're both naked. He's giving me a hickey which I think is pretty juvenile but at this point I don't care, let's just fuck on this twin xl dorm bed. So he puts a condom on, which I had to supply, and just shoves it in. No easing, no teasing, ouch. Okay, main event, let's go! He just looks down the entire time at his dick in my vagina and slowly, very shallowly thrusts. Not much stimulation and I'm trying my best to move my hips around and grab his ass to go in more, but he's not having it. I ask him to use his hands too but he thinks that means grab my boobs. Maybe he's trying not to blow his load immediately? I suggest we change it up and go from behind — he's an ass man after all. I turn around and back my ass up onto his dick, he puts it in and before I can shake my ass twice, he cums. He apologizes. Cute, flattering, okay. My turn to get off now. No. He gets off the bed, throws the used condom on the desk because he doesn’t own a trash bin for some reason, and keeps jerking off. ""This is weird,"" he said. ""Oh? In a bad way?"" I asked. ""No, I don't think so. Just weird."" Okay, well that's weird.  He gets back on the very small bed and we start making out again because he thinks he can go for round 2. He stops kissing me and says ""yeah this never happens, I can't get hard again."" I say that's normal, you literally just came 3 minute ago. He insists it's unusual. Sure. I play around with his dick, get on top of him, grind on him, nothing. I ask half jokingly, ""ha, is it me?"" He says ""it might be, I don't know it could be a lot."" Well..thanks. He asks if I came, I say no but don't feel bad because my bottom half still works so we can keep going. I ask him to eat me out and he does, and it was actually pretty good, like the best oral I've experienced. Still don't come, but close. He seems to think I did so he stops and we get dressed. He brags about how his ""head game is pretty fucking great."" Then he says the zinger: ""I don't know. Like, have you done this before? Like had sex with many people? It doesn't seem like you know what you're doing."" EXCUSE ME? I'm...offended. And hurt. You came within 5 seconds of being in me and I'M bad at sex? You jackhammered my pussy and sandpaper rubbed my clit with unclipped nails, and I'M bad? You didn't even thrust when we started PIV and I'M bad?? Ya'll....hear me out. I get some people aren't sexually compatible. It happens. You can always tell me if you're not enjoying yourself or want to stop. But under no circumstance is it okay to fucking insult me when you won't tell me what you like. I asked him multiple times, ""what do you like? what do you want me to do to you?"" only to get ""I don't know, anything."" So I did what I could do. He walks me back to my car at 1 am, gives me a half assed hug, and says goodbye. No ""text me that you got back home safely"" or ""be careful"" considering I'm two hours away. Just nothing. I just needed to vent, friends. Any words of encouragement or advice is welcome. I'm texting him later to tell him that what he did wasn't cool and if he doesn't want to hook up again that's fine, but never insult me again. I just got out of a sexually abusive relationship within the past year and opened myself up to him, which he knows about. And it just brought me back down to where I began.

It feels very powerful but also very frustrating sometimes... As a woman a lot of ""prep work"" goes into having sex. The outfit, having freshly shaved/waxed/making sure you are clean and smell good, planning around your period, etc. Many of my female friends literally time out their beauty routines based on when they intend to have sex.

Some weeks it's insatiable other times it's hard for me to get turned on. Anybody else like this?,2009
idjlta,"For me, when i finger myself, it feels like I’m a doctor or something looking around in there. It doesn’t feel sexy. and my hand gets tired.... and my arm isn’t long enough so i can’t really lay down and do it..... it just feels awkward. but being fingered by someone else can sometimes be CRAZY like EXHAUSTING. it’s almost too good! being fingered is like the wettest i ever get and the only time i can squirt.  do any other people with vaginas feel awkward fingering themselves??? growing up that seemed like.... the thing.... the way to masturbate..... but i just can not get into it i also cam and fingering myself is a huge request and i’m just like ugh ok it doesn’t feel good but whatever lol",It feels like nothing if I do it. It feels like OHMIGOD ITS WAY TOO MUCH BUT DONT EVER STOP if someone else does it.,2088
ietls7,"As probably every woman ever, I also feel self-conscious about my body. For example, I used to hate being on top cause I thought I don't look sexy. Sometimes I'd be way up in my own head and I couldn't climax. Which sucks. My boyfriend always kept telling me that I look great in every angle, but I never fully believed. My confidence grew a bit, but sometimes I could regress to my old ways of avoiding certain positions. Fast forward to last night, I was on top, reverse cowgirl. My bf told me that I look so effin hot and asked me can he film me so I can see it myself. And I said yes. And I can't believe I've been bringing myself down over this. I don't look bad at all. Actually, I can even dare to say that I look good. All the flaws that I thought were so BAD (specifically I have stretch marks on my bum) aren't even that visible. They are there, but there is something so much hotter going on. The movements, grunts, his hands over me... My confidence finally grew and I can't wait to ride this wonderful man again! I don't know if anyone needs to hear this, but ladies we should stop feeling bad because of our  bodies. Men really do not notice our flaws. I wish I believed my boy when he kept telling me this for years. Edit 1: I'm so glad this story helped some of you and that I got so many positive comments! Edit 2: No, my bf didn't trick me into anything, he filmed it with my phone and we deleted the video after we watched it. He actually did it just in order to help me boost my self-confidence :D",How does someone feel better about not really having a butt?.. asking for a friend of course edit: y'all are unbelievably nice. thank you.,1388
if5vig,"This literally happened a few hours ago. For reference, I'm 28 and the guy is 34. We've been seeing each other for about a month now and this guy is really introverted, to the point that it makes him more than a little anxious. So I have been the initatior for most of the time we are seeing each other.  I asked him out first, I kissed him first. At first I thought that he might not be as interested but once I do something first, it's like he's comfortable doing it as well without asking. Anyway, he came over yesterday and I'm not going to lie, I teased him like all throughout dinner. We get to my room and he sat on my bed and I got up and took my dress off and he just came without me touching him.  I didn't understand what was happening at first but when I got it, I started smiling, not laughing at him but only because I thought it was so hot that he got so worked up that he just finished. I went to go to him and he just got up, said sorry and ran out of my apartment. I couldn't really follow him cuz he did it so fast. I tried calling and he just apologized and said he would talk to me tomorrow. It's now tomorrow and nothing. I want to message him in a way that doesn't sound condescending or embarrassing because I didn't mind at all and frankly, if I had it my way, I would like to see if that could happen again. Just looking for advice on how to word it. Don't need advice telling me to leave him due to him running away. I'm not doing that because I know he was just embarrassed and because I still want him. So any advice on how to word that it was ok would be appreciated.  UPDATE-  My update post was removed so Im putting the update here. I really want to thank everyone for their advice and I tried to read all of them. The three pieces of advice I kept seeing were pretend it didn't happen, or talk to him in person to tell him how you feel, or make a move when you guys are together. I didn't really know what to do so I just decided I would try each one if the previous advice didn't work.  He actually had tried calling me on sunday, the day I made the post but I had a feeling he was going to try to break it off because he was embarrassed so I didn't answer. Instead I texted him and asked if I could see him Monday night. He said yes. I went over his place and It was just casual convo because we were both avoiding the subject and it was so, so, awkward. After  5 mins of that, I just decided to tell him the truth, that I thought what happened was hot, that I didn't think it was bad in anyway. His face just looked so hopeful, like he wanted to believe me but he didn't.  He got up and went to the kitchen for water. Tbh, by now, this was like 20 mins, I was just done with this convo so I followed him, cornered him against his fridge, got on my knees and just gave him a blowjob. When I was done, I got up and just said, ""your dick has just been in my mouth. I'm obviously into you so can we stop with the awkwardness now?."" I don't know how guys but saying and doing that fucking worked cuz he laughed. I guess that's a really good indicator that a girl likes you. It's like a switch has flipped and he's back now to how he was. He actually initated sex later on that night twice with no prompting for me so I'm really happy.  We did talk after. He said he just panicked and by the time he realized what he did, he was in his car and thought he couldn't fix anything. I told him that I get that he has anxiety but he has to trust me when I say something. I also realize now that I have to be the intiator at least at first. It just reassures him when I do that and I have no problem with that because it makes him comfortable and me as well. I did tell him that I made a post for advice and in his words, ""I guess, I now have to avoid reddit forever"" but he's ok with it. So we're good. It's a learning curve for me but I have no issues with that because I want him and I think we will be good if we communicate.  Thanks for all the advice everyone. I really appreciate it.","There are some pretty good answers here ... tbh I just want an update!!! Can’t lie I love when a guy finishes fast, I feel sexy, such a compliment.",2118
ifkeyu,"I know this sounds strange but I remember when I was a teenager, like age 15-18, “makeout sessions” were a thing. With my teenage bf, we would make out for a loooong time, heavy with tongue and all that. But we wouldn’t have sex. So I feel like we kinda compensated for sex with kissing a lot..?  I’m 25 now and I’ve noticed with partners, especially casual partners, there’s barely any kissing. It’s mostly foreplay and then penetrative sex. I’ve never had a long steamy makeout session with anyone in my early/mid 20s.  Anyone else relate or is it just me? Edit: ok when I posted this, I had NO IDEA it would kinda blow up like this. Lol!!! Love reading everyone’s story!","I’m 28, and that has been my experience as an adult as well. But I gotta say... I MISS THE KISSING! I love kissing. It makes me feel so much more connected to my partner. It’s also a wonderful, underused form of foreplay! That being said, all that extra connection I’m feeling means that all that kissing is limited to guys I have actual romantic feelings for. I just feel weird and don’t have the desire to kiss a man (no matter how intimate we’ve been) if I don’t feel something for him.",2032
igdi5f,"Why is it that pretty much all guys go on about how they love eating pussy and they're good at it and it's their favorite thing in the world, but then when you're actually in a relationship with them they only do it once every couple months AND you even have to ask for it?! What's stopping them?","Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear.  In other words, those of us that love it don’t brag about, we just do it.

ih0gt4,"So, first of all, I grew up in a religious household, in a community that wasn’t very tolerant, so gayness was always something that “happened to other people” in my mind, which I think is true for a lot of people. The possibility that I was a lesbian is not something that ever crossed my mind  Growing up, I avoided intimate relationships (partially because of the religious household thing). I was only interested in sex in theory (I’d read about it in books/movies, etc), and sometimes I would even flirt with guys, but when it seemed like a guy might actually try to ask me out, I’d panic and back away The first time I had sex was when I went to college. I was drunk, which got me out of my head enough that I could go through the motions, despite not being very into it. During it, I remember thinking “finally, I’m doing what normal girls do” rather than actually focusing on the sex that I was having Afterwards, I just decided that maybe I wasn’t a very sexual person, but I also decided that I couldn’t avoid dating forever, so over the next couple of years I dated some people, and each time when we would have eventually have sex, it’d be purely because I felt like it was what I ‘should’ do rather than truly wanting to. It was always him that had to initiate it because oftentimes days or even weeks could go by without me remembering that we should probably have sex again For me, sex always felt like something I was doing *for* him, and not *with* him, and any pleasure I got out of it was kind of self-centred, because I was always focused on how I looked in whatever position we were in, or how much he was enjoying himself because of me, which would then make *me* feel good In other words, I would get so focused on thinking about how sexually appealing I looked, without ever thinking about how *he* looks, or being turned on by his naked body like he was with mine. I wasn’t interested in having sex, I was just interested in feeling wanted. As a result when I did have sex, ‘vanilla’ felt boring/uncomfortable since the sex on its own wasn’t a turn-on. So my sex life included a lot of domination/rough sex/BDSM, etc All of this came to a head when I went to a party and finally met the girl that gave me a rude awakening. Immediately, she was the type of girl I was used to “admiring”. I’d always thought this strong sense of ~admiration~ I sometimes felt for some girls just meant that I wanted to be her friend really badly, or even that I was jealous of her, but later that night, we ended up dancing together as gal pals do, and then out of nowhere she started kissing me, and I finally felt like I could understand why people get so eager about sex. I’m not saying the skies opened and a rainbow shot down from the heavens or anything, but I actually felt arousal, and not the tense anxiety I had been mistaking for arousal before, but actual arousal For the first time, I genuinely wanted to see someone naked, and pleasure them, rather than just being willing to “let” *them* see *me* naked and take pleasure from my body. With her, for the first time ever I was an active, enthusiastic participant during sex without feeling like I was having to pretend to be enjoying myself while waiting for it to be over This is long, but I wrote it just in case there’s even one person out there who might benefit from it because I know if I’d read a post like this a couple of years ago, it’d have saved me a lot of stress and tears TL;DR: Found out my “low sex drive/fear of commitment” was really just a failure to ever consider whether I might just not be into dudes EDIT: I’m close to tears at how supportive you guys have been, and I appreciate it so much. And to the girls who are in the same shoes I was in not too long ago, I wish you nothing but the best as you continue to discover your true self. Whoever she ends up being, I bet she’s great.

ihvjbs,"I visited a nude beach recently and I thought it was going to be a sexual experience for me, because I had always associated nudity with sex. But when I stripped down and saw others acting so casually whilst nude, it wasn't really sexual at all. In fact, it was quite peaceful and liberating. I interacted with others and didn't really notice that they were naked. It made me think that as a society, we focus too much on clothes and if nudity was more accepted, the human body wouldn't be treated as a sexual object all the time. Just curious to see what others think.","I grew up with Hippies. There was lots of naked hottubing and swimming in lakes. It helped to create different context for nudity. I can be unphased by it.  Tho in an even vague sexual context it's easy to get turned on.  We definitely place too much emphasis on the taboo of nudity. It is much less so in Europe and elsewhere outside the U.S.     It really shows in our TV and Movie rating system. Heaven forbid children see boobs! But violence is okay.  Besides, clothing that covers up some, but not all can be even MORE sexy.",836

ij0wwp,"My girlfriend and I(m23) broke up 3 Months ago. We´ve been together for 1 year and it was my first relationship. I was happy with her and she was the first person I really opend up to. I could talk about everything with her amongst other things my sexuality. It was something I never really got the chance to do. I live in germany, sex and sexuality really isn´t something thats talked about (I guess Germany really is prudish). My parents wouldn´t talk about it either. So 3 months ago my girlfriend said she wouldn´t love me anymore. We broke up the next day. We both cried but I guess it was for the best. We never really had a dispute while we were together, we always talked it out and thats the way we´ve gone apart too. I still miss her or better I miss her as somebody I can be totally honest with. Sooooo anyway my sexual drive is pretty high I guess? I masturbate at least two times a day, when I´m bored even more. I watch videos or browse for pics. Last month I discovered this site online with sex advertisments locally from different private users. Didn´t seem like a scam and I used it as fap material. It turned me on alot to imagine to do it with someone ""in reach"" (I live in the middle of nowhere so in reach is still like 15km). One led to the other and I discovered a site for prostitutes. And yesterday I did it. I wanted to see what it was like, if making ""loveless"" love would be something I would enjoy, at least that´s what I´m telling myself. It was a pretty weird experience honestly. I was pretty tensed up even before I went there. I was fighting with myself the whole week if I should go there or not. At last I decided to do it. I was pretty nervous at the start and I really didn´t know how to handle the situation. After a bit of foreplay she blew me for a while. I mean it was hot and all, but I just didnt´t turned on my gears. Even when she sat ontop of me. When we went into missionary it klicked in my head. That moment I realized that this wasn´t something for me. I stopped and laid down. She was a bit confused and I tried to explained it to her. I think she didn´t understand everything I said, but she said something like 'sometimes you just have to get your head free' and then she started to give me a handjob xD. I took me forever to reach climax. When I say forever I mean forever. I was on the verge of cumming for like 10min at least and when I did finally I was pretty beat. But honestly it took a huge load (pun intended) from my mind. After I finished she refreshed herself in the bathroom while I was still recovering on the bed. I got up after some time and we talked a bit. She said her clients have all different reasons to come to her and it´s mainly to loose up and enjoy for a while and forget about all the rest. She had a point there I guess. I asked why she would do this as a job and she said, she had sick sister at home and she needed the money to support her back home. Her sister has cancer and it was terminal. I comforted her and she cried a bit. I hugged her and we talked for the rest of the time. When my time was up I wished her goodbye and a strong heart, hugged her a last time and left. I was oddly in a good mood because of the wholesomeness and it was as if something heavy was gone. And now I don´t know what to do with this. It is a pretty weird story and I have the need to tell this to someone (Hello reddit :D). I´m a bit ashamed of myself because having it with a prostitute isn´t really socially accepted. I don´t think my parents and friends would approve or could understand. I don´t know if it is okay to just be ""carnal"" sometimes. But it was weirdly pretty wholesome and I got a whole different perspective on prostitution. Also I experienced ""loveless"" love-making and it definitly isn´t something for me. I want someone I can look in the eye while doing it and just know it´s the right one. I´m still a bit torn. Can I hear your thought´s? Thanks in advance.","Sounds to me you've answered a few questions for yourself. I think its good to realize that sexual intimacy is something special that deserves careful attention. I don't think you need to be ashamed, I think your reactions and what you are feeling now is because you're a normal decent human being.",2949
ilqcqb,"r/sex has gotten a little weird lately, and I think it's time we do a little self-reflection. The function of r/sex is pretty clear. Rule 5 says it best - ""The main forum is focused primarily on posts seeking specific advice, education, or discussion about distinctive personal situations."" Advice is the operative word. People come here for advice. They discover a question (or better put, a problem) in their sexual journey, and they come here to confer with a like-minded group of individuals to help them find the answer (or solution). Finding said solution to the problem is the goal that you, the replier, are tasked with. It's a noble endeavor, and historically for the most part r/sex has done a bang-up job. Now, admittedly, I don't go out of my way to navigate to r/sex specifically anymore. I only see the posts that're upvoted enough to hit my main feed. But when they do, I read them. And seemingly every single one of these posts goes the same way: >OP: ""I'm struggling with \[*so and so problem*\] with my partner and want to solve it, any ideas?""   >   >Every top response: ""Just ignore it! Fuck 'em! You should never do anything you don't want to do! You should completely disregard any challenge and eschew any difficult experience and recluse into a tiny bubble you create for yourself where everything you love is all that exists and anyone who likes anything you don't like is an enemy you cut yourself off from forever!"" Obviously this is hyperbolic, but I'm trying to make a point that this is the general vibe r/sex's discourse is giving off. Ok, yes. Of course, you are absolutely right. **You should NEVER EVER be forced, persuaded, manipulated, coerced or pressured into doing anything you don't want to do.** That's rape. Cut-and-dry, by-the-books, definitive rape. You're right. It's bad, it happens a lot, and it's something we should all make an active effort to fight against. Of course. OF COURSE. Except... when it isn't. Stay with me, because I know that line of thinking is a rapist's bread and fucking butter, but please stay with me here. There's no such thing as a completely perfect match, and that's a good thing. You're never going to find two people that have absolutely 100% exact perfect sexual synergy. Sure, maybe for some of you all the big kink categories might match up pretty well with your partner, maybe a couple of you even got a perfect match on mojo upgrade or whatever, but it's in the little indescribable things. A big part of the fun of a relationship is resolving the ways that you're different (not just in sex). You're not dating a clone of yourself and I promise you'd hate if you did. I need analogies to explain my point so please forgive me. For the musicians, it's like finding a way to take two different chords and creating a harmonic melody. For the readers, it's like reading a book from the perspective of someone with a different life experience from you. For the cooks, it's like finding a way to take two different ingredients and making a delicious meal. It's discovery, and it's the fun part. It can go wrong, of course, and then it should probably end, sure. But when it goes right, it's what makes the magic. People come to r/sex because the first time they tried to mix peanuts and chilies, it tasted gross. And they want it to taste good, they know it could but they don't know how. This is the part we tend to forget. **they want it to work**, and they came to you with that goal in mind. I might be getting lost in analogies and I know commenters are gonna come out of the woodwork arguing against the concept of perfect matches while missing the real point; people come here for solutions or answers to sexual problems or questions that arise with people they love. It's fine to have sexual differences with your loved one. They don't want to end their relationship, or deny their partners the pleasure they seek. They want help finding pragmatic solutions. Because people enjoy pleasing their partners, even if they don't receive direct sexual stimulation in return from doing so. The received pleasure comes from the act of giving selflessly to someone you love. Or perhaps their partner does something similar for them. Either way, it isn't apples to apples, and it isn't up to you to argue against *if it's what they want to do*. Le'ts be very super extremely clear on something. Let's draw a hard line. It is **perfectly fine** to do something you don't enjoy for a good reason, if you choose to. For example, I hate trying to figure out what to get my mother for her birthday. It's a nightmare. She's old and really picky and judgmental and already owns everything she wants to own and I've given her many dozens of birthday presents in her life and I'm out of ideas. I hate it, but I do it because I love her. I'm not planning on stopping any time soon, even though I hate it. If I go to an internet community for advice on what to get her, I am NOT looking for ""OMG DONT BUY HER ANYTHING, YOU SHOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING YOU DONT WANNA DO"". I know when I'm being forced against my will. I know what that looks like. This isn't that, and I didn't come here for that advice. Thanks, but no thanks. I came here for help overcoming my challenge, not for help talking me out of trying. ""I hate the taste of cum but my bf likes when I swallow, any ideas?"" ""OMG FUCK HIM, YOU SHOULDN'T..."" blah blah blah. You're not helping, and you need to understand this in order for r/sex to keep kicking ass. Like, it's 2020, and this is reddit. We're all woke too, okay? We don't need every single post to start with ""you should never do anything you don't want to..."". It's implicit. Everyone here knows and agrees already. Ok ok, I will admit, occasionally there ARE posts that very obviously need that kind of advice, and when that happens it is sound and good. But it doesn't apply to every thread. It doesn't apply to most of them. Now, are you gonna help them, or are you gonna use their struggle as your opportunity to virtue signal?","Same thing on r/relationship_advice. “Just break up/divorce already!!” Sometimes. Absolutely. Like that relationship is destroying you. But like did we forgot to work through problems? Build up confidence? Is that cancel culture? I remember when I was totally new to sex and everything around it. It was so scary to give my first hand and bj. I really didn’t wanted to! I thought it would be gross, it scared me. But seeing he loved it made me love it and now I enjoy it. Sometimes you learn to love things you always despised. I hated cheese as a kid. Definitely not anymore.

inweda,"Another post about being woken up with sex reminded me of a thing I used to do when I was young and too timid to initiate and thought it may help someone else. We agreed on me wearing an “indicator” that I was DTF. When I was wearing a certain scrunchie in my hair that was his green light. It was actually a lot of fun because I’d wear it when we’d go shopping, to family events, etc and it drove him crazy! Sometimes I’d put it on after he went to sleep and he would wake up to seeing it, granting consent for the “alarm cock” as we call it.

This led to a very frank, honest discussion about contraception and related topics. We talked about condoms and birth control pills. We researched the effectiveness of various contraceptive methods, and calculated the effectiveness of combining methods. I explained some things about female anatomy and fertility to make sure we were on the same page. We talked about STI testing. By the end of the conversation, I’ve got to say, I really trust him. I’m confident that we both care about being safe and that we both understand what that entails. And I’m proud of us for sitting down and talking about this like the mature, responsible adults that we’re trying to become. Friends, if a couple of awkward teenagers can do it, so can you.

iq5xzs,I've discovered this new little RP that I'm really really enjoying. It basically has me walk up to my bf when he's doing something innocuous. Like the last time it was when he was reorganizing some of his bookshelves. I drop down and start going down on him while he tries to continue to do what he set out to do. I finish and these are some of the times I love to swallow it all up to leave no evidence behind. Then I continue on my way and pretend like nothing really happened. Hardly even an acknowledgment from me except maybe a smile. Something about this really really gets me going. Maybe it's the implied secrecy that no one else would know except the two of us .. even though there really isn't anyone around. Maybe it would be more fun if we started having people over and sneaking away to do this. It's also very hot that I can pretend like nothing happened and it's a silly little game we play. Please tell me I'm not the only weirdo who enjoys things like this!,I love this..... a drive by BJ lol Im so going to steal This!,1671
iqlroy," I’m seeing this wonderful man and he’s aware of my deafness. To give some background info, I was born deaf which has affected my speech development. My voice sounds different and it’s my biggest insecurity. I’ve been made fun of because of my voice. Hell I refuse to speak unless it’s necessary.  This man is aware that I’m insecure about my voice and he said he would like to sleep with me one day but I just can’t. I know deaf people are very...vocal during sex and have been made of for that reason. I just don’t want to be a laughing stock. By the way I’m a virgin.","It would be unfair of anyone to say that you should just go for it because insecurities are not always rational. You might know that this guy cares about you, but the way you feel is not something you can always reason your way through. So it’s going to take a bit of effort on your part to sort out just how much potential embarrassment you can deal with. I’m not saying that anything is going to happen, but according to your insecurities it might so here is an option. You can try to talk to your guy about it or maybe even send him an email if it’s too much to talk about it face to face, and tell him what makes you worry about your first time. You can try to think of what sexual activity might be the least anxiety inducing thing and try making small noises to see how it feels. It could be as simple as if he touches you and you like how it feels just respond with a very quick vocal response. It might take a bit to work up to making more sounds but this can be a fun exercise. You could also go the non sexual route and try to speak more with him. Maybe give him a flirtatious look and say “hi” the idea is to slowly give yourself permission to be vulnerable with something that really scares you with a person that cares about you. It would also give him more of an opportunity to adjust to how you might best want him to react to this newer thing for you. The best thing to do when looking for support from others is creating a space where they can support you in a way that will be beneficial to you.",2986
iquls3,"My friend mentioned once that her boyfriend doesn’t precum, at all. Then i realized that I never really thought to check if my boyfriend is precumming, or to look at it when he does. So it was brought to my attention and ... whew  It. Is. Glorious. Feeling that wetness on his dick is enough to get all my clothes off. Although I don’t see it come out everytime, or maybe i just dont notice. Yesterday we had a verrryyy slow sensual teasing session, because his family was home. As soon as he pulled off his boxers his precum was practically shooting out his dick. Its just SCRUMPTIOUS oh jesus Thank you. Is this a thing many people enjoy? Males, does it happen often?

irgnew,"I guess just to say that, I was seriously overthinking this stuff when I was younger.  Yes obviously, have some class and charm when you ask a lady out, court a girl first, but when I got more confident to speak up about this stuff with women I was dating?  A well delivered proposal for ""Dinner and sex"" can be \*very\* well received indeed.   Of course if she's not interested you thank her for her time and move on, or slow down a bit if she's just not ready for that but still wants to date, of course, sense the mood, fellas and respect her boundaries!   My simple point is, I have had literally dozens of dates where I took weeks to work up the nerve to propose taking the lady out to dinner and ""maybe some fun when we get home?""  or simple ""would you like to come to my place after this pizza?"".  90% of them said they wondered why I hadn't pursued bedding them 3 dates ago, and I was totally oblivious to their being \*quite\* receptive to it!   Sensing the mood, having good execution, and then?  Just the balls to \*ask\* if she's interested makes all the difference.   But literally all of them said after I told them all this ""Uhhh,, tacos/pizza/steak dinner and sex?  Yeah, sounds great!  You were really overthinking this, guy, I was sending ALL kinds of signals I was down"".    I just wanted to share that tidbit for any other guys out there who like me, can be SUPER oblivious.....I'm much more astute than I was, but hey, ladies are people too, just like you!

is9c5b,"The guy I’m dating now is so sweet, timid, and a bit shy outside the bedroom. We met at work and I would’ve never expected him to be any different intimately. He’s like a big, cuddly nice guy to everyone. Even when we first started seeing each other outside of work he was like this. We just started being intimate 2 weeks ago.  And I was so shocked the first time. He is very dominant, very commanding and not soft spoken like he is usually, very vulgar with his dirty talk. He even looks differently, like more serious. Don’t get me wrong the sex is great, I am submissive in bed, and I’ve never have orgasmed so many times in my life with anyone. And it’s mostly from penetration.

it17ft,"I have this friend I've known for around six months. I find him extremely funny and fun to chill with, and we've been hanging out a lot. I don't find him hot at all, so i thought we'd just be friends and I hoped we were on the same page. We were hanging out and ended up talking about hot celebrities. I said I'd hook up with a certain person, and he asked me if I do hookups. I told him I'd had a few, and he was shocked because he ""didn't take me for that type of girl."" So he starting asking me all these personal questions about my sex life, like when I did it last, which I declined to answer. Then he was just like ""I'm DTF."" I was like ""I'm not."" He said ""You did it with all those other guy, why not me? At least I'm someone you know and love spending time with."" I said ""But I don't find you attractive."" He got mad and said ""Oh, so you're judging me for my looks?"" I said ""I'm not judging you, I'm just saying I wouldn't have sex with you."" Then he was like ""I might be good at it. You have to at least give me a chance."" I said ""You're scaring the shit out of me. Leave now."" Then he insisted he was just kidding, and I was like ""Okay, whatever."" He kept making naughty comments to me throughout the night, hinting at sex. Eventually he was like ""Why would you give your pussy for free to men you didn't even know, who did nothing to earn it?"" I said ""I enjoy attractive men."" He said ""Stop talking like a slut then acting like you don't want sex."" At that point I was so offended, I made him leave. Now I'm basically wondering if I should ever speak to him again at all, or if there's anything in particular I should say to this guy.","He's definitely not your friend, probably never was.

iwalf9,"When I was 13, I moved to a new state and was sexually assaulted at school by three upper classmen. I essentially lost my virginity anally before I even knew what masturbation was. That said, the idea of anything entering my ass has always been a no go for me. I've heard of prostate simulation, and well, I've always been scared that I'm going to trigger myself by trying anything involving my anus so I stayed the hell away from that.  I finally decided to start therapy about a month ago and it's been going well. One thing I've always wanted to do but was scared of was trying a butt plug while masturbating. With my wife at her mom's house and some liquid courage, I decided to give it a go. Low and behold, I didn't trigger myself and it made the orgasm much more intense! Keep in mind, I was/am a little intoxicated. I'm hopeful that this is something I can do again, and maybe something my wife would be interested in exploring with me as well. I've had the urge to try it for almost 9 years now, and I'm literally in tears knowing that I can do it without triggering flashbacks. Not only that, but it's incredibly pleasurable and I think it can really spice up my sex life. Thanks for reading! I'm currently done fucking myself in the ass, but I'm happy with the results and I'm proud to say I'm trigger free! Can't wait to do it again soon ;) EDIT: To clarify, my wife is at her mom's house right now and I'm at home.  EDIT #2: I appreciate all the support surrounding my abuse. It truly goes to show that trauma isn't something to be ashamed of, and quite honestly I wish I had shared it sooner. Much love, and though I may not be able to respond to each and every comment, I just want you all to know that my drunken anal masturbation session last night has led to some of the most positive support I've ever felt in my life.

ixoeg9,"So I went over this guy's place last night, it was fun, we were talking a lot and it wasn't awkward. We were also drinking a little and took some edibles. I could tell he really wanted to make a move because he keeps inching closer. But because I want to see what he'll do, I didn't made a move either. Eventually I got bored of waiting so I made my move. I told him im going home, so he walked me to his door. When I gave him a goodbye hug, I kissed him and we started to make out. He was all over me in an instant. But what I noticed is that he keeps sticking his whole tongue in my mouth. I know that we're french kissing but still, i made out with guys before and this is the first time someone is sticking his whole tongue in and devouring my mouth it almost hurt because I could feel his teeth. I had to stop and tell him that it's too much tongue. So he would calm down with the tongue but started to do it again.  We managed to get in his room but at this point I'm exhausted telling him that it's too much tongue and I wasn't even reciprocating his kisses anymore because I can't! I couldn't even open my mouth without a full on tongue attack. I could feel he's very excited and has a huge boner, but I wasn't into it anymore so I told him I really need to go. Kissing is a huge part of sex to me, if a guy is a good kisser almost always I would give in and have sex. But it is also a big turn off when a guy doesn't know how to kiss, i feel like this guy wouldn't know how to fuck either. Is it just me? Edit: Wow I didn't know this will blow up. Anyway some people are confused about the part where I'm making my ""move"". I was really about to leave but I thought I'll just kiss him goodnight.  And he's a really nice guy, no one is villifying him. I was just sharing my experience and thought I would ask people from Reddit if they experience the same thing.","I hooked up with a guy last week who would open his mouth all the way as soon as I went in for a kiss, and then he would vigorously suck my bottom lip into his mouth.

izo08l,"So I wouldn't have thought he'd have one dominant bone in his body, but the few times I've sort of encouraged him to try, without him getting embarrassed or thinking too much about it, have been incredibly amazing.  I'm sort of embarrassed to say that when I'm intimate with myself I use those few moments. I want him to do more but I just don't want to come bursting out!  The things that got me way more excited than I thought possible included him texting me in simple but firm tone about what I should be doing. Something as simple as: ""Love you dear, when are you home tonight? And be prepared to spend the rest of the evening without panties, as soon as you enter the door. I've decided you've not earned them tonight."" Or him agreeing to play my favorite board game but every time he beat me he would get one wish -- first it was a BJ his favorite way, then it was ordering me to play with myself. I think that was really really hot and so uncharacteristic. I'm loving this side of him. Help me encourage more of it!","“I get wet when I think about you being dominant”. Boom done. “Tell me what you want me to do. And I’ll happily do it for you.” Boom done. “Put your hand around my neck.” Boom done. “Sir, should my panties be on or off for you?” Boom done.

j2k3ug,"I'm a straight male and when it comes to porn, I can only watch something if the woman is getting genuine enjoyment and pleasure from the sex or sexual activity. I have to stop watching if I notice any tiny sign that she might be faking it. I need to see the woman having real orgasms and being passionate and into it, like it's real authentic sex that she is really horny for. This means that I find myself searching for female-centric porn most of the time, like bellesa or seeing women getting their pussy eaten out. Do any other guys or girls have the same feeling for porn, or does the woman's pleasure not bother you? You could say ""well how do you know she is enjoying it? she might be really good at faking it"" That is true, but I think there are obvious signs when a woman is not faking it. Things like involuntary body spasms from orgasms, loud involuntary noises and certain faces they make during the act, these all show that she's highly unlikely to be faking it.","Same for me, thats why whenever i open any porn videos site i just watch the Amateur category",1908

jkeusz,"I (M29);got with my current girlfriend (F25) about 9 months ago. Things have been great, we have a really good chemistry and our sex lives are as exciting as they can be under current circumstances. One issue that's come up more recently is the fact that I don't go down on her near as often as I used to. About 6 months ago, my girlfriend stopped shaving. I don't really have a problem with it most times, but there are things about an unkempt, bushy vagina that just don't make me want to put my face in it. I definitely don't get turned on by the idea like I used to, and i used to go down on her almost any time we had sex. And my girlfriend has noticed. We got into a fight the other day because she goes down on me somewhat regularly, but she's mad I don't reciprocate anymore. When I told her it's because she doesn't shave or trim down there, she got really offended and started talking about her bodily autonomy and how what she does or doesn't do shouldn't determine whether I find her sexy or not.  Now, she refuses to have sex unless I go down on her first. At first I just dealt with it, I'm still really attracted to her and the bush isn't a deal breaker, I just don't like to do it. But now it's getting kind of ridiculous and I'm feeling resentful about how she is approaching it. We haven't had sex in a little over 2 weeks because we're now playing this game of sexual chicken.  I'm not sure what to do. On the one hand, I think she's right. If she doesn't want to shave, that's her decision. but on the other hand, I feel like it isn't fair she get mad at me for not wanting to go down on her when she doesn't trim or shave. I feel like those aren't outrageous requests, and I know I would be looked down upon for expecting head without accommodating her needs. I guess I'm looking for advice. This thing is starting to get between us, but I feel like just biting the bullet is wrong since it ignores my feelings on the matter.","You’re both in the right.

jpb4j4,"I often get the sense that a lot of guys don't really understand or appreciate how much practice, skill, and determination it takes to get to a point where you can handle letting a guy just take full control and face fuck you however he likes. For me it took a bit before I was really at a place, both physically and mentally, where I could really handle it being done roughly. Even then, that doesn't change the fact that it's a very uncomfortable, strenuous act. I'm not trying to say that I don't enjoy doing it, because I do like doing it. But, still. Not being able to breathe, gagging, even throwing up, are always factors. It's just the stuff that you eventually get used to and learn to deal with. I was just sort of pondering this, and questioning do guys really ""get"" like how challenging this is to do for a girl? I feel like they don't really see it as something that is impressive on the girl's part, like a skill. It's more often taken for granted I think. I feel that it's often falsely credited as ""the guy does all the work in a face fuck"". So, never mind the fact that she's the one taking the dick down her throat at your whim while she is literally choking on it? I feel like the world of porn has programmed people to denigrate the woman's efforts in this act as a given. Like, disregard any effort or skill required for her to do it, gloss over the reality of just how uncomfortable the process can be for her, and just focus on the spectacle of how ""dominant"" it makes the guy seem. Almost as if vanilla deep throating is a more appreciated and respected act than face fucking, even though face fucking is much more difficult in all aspects for her to do. Sorry if this comes off as ranty or anything, I don't mean it that way... just musing about how it seems to be an underappreciated, or under-credited skill. In my experience, a lot of guys seem to take it for granted. Like they don't consider the experience from her perspective, or have been programmed to gloss over it. I dunno.",I fucking hate it.

js0cga,"Me (M27) and my partner (M29) have a scenerio that we have been playing for years.  It grows and changes -- almost like (and forgive me for comparing it to something some may not find super sexy) playing DnD with the same group for a long time.  It's the same set-up, and the same characters, but, by returning again and again and iterating on it, you enhance the story. Here we go -- time to talk about one of my favorite, most precious aspects of my life that I havent told real life humans because its vulnerable and overly earnest to do so~ He was a classics minor, history major.  I was a classics major, history minor.  We are both on our ways toward PHDs in studying Ancient Greece, him taking a more anthropological route, and me working with the surviving literature.  [Insert joke about how every Classics student is gay here] You may think I'm leading up toward saying, ""because we like Greek myths, which are 90% about non-consentual activities, we do a lot of dubious consent play.""  Oh no, friend, that would be mainstream enough for me to talk about with my friends and not have to make a reddit to be able to spill my guts to someone. No, (prepare yourself for full, unshielded, genuine vulnerability folks) my partner plays as an ancient king and I am his favorite concubine. I could be in the middle of doing something unathetically modern, and he will order me to pleasure him and next thing I know I am on my knees.  It is like being hypnotized.  It is my favorite thing on this earth.  I love when he commands me to him.  I love what he does to me after I get there. My character is a gift he won in war.  His cup-bearer.  His therapon -- the only person he would trust to bear the mantle of his honor in his stead.  (Yes ""Song of Achilles"" is like the pumpkin spice coffee of the Classics world...but there's a reason basic things are popular -- they're hot and accessible). God there is something so hot about being wanted.  About being desired.  About being a gift.  About someone else taking the reigns and giving you specific commands that can be correctly fulfilled.  That's why there's so many dubious concent scenes in romance books -- while in practice each of those scenes would be traumatizing, under the rules of the fiction, where no real, complex person is being hurt, you can imagine yourself to be wanted by this virile person who desires you so fully that you need not meet him in the middle, he'll come to and in you. When I shower, there's about a 1 in 6 chance he will wordlessly walk in, help himself to me, and walk out.  I will be folding clothes or washing dishes, and he will open my pants and start stroking me while ordering me not to get distracted from my work. Having this secret world between us is the most intoxicating thing Ive ever experienced.  I am very shy and skittish in real life, and being able to combat my illogical fears by taking my King's arm and making believe that as a warrior, he will protect me, soothes me and makes life fun.  Fight crazy with crazy.  I feel so safe walking beside my King.  And all I need to trade for that safety -- trade for him using his body to protect me, is letting him use mine whenever he wishes.  Win win~ We have a rich and normative life outside of the fantasy.  He is my best friend when he is not my sovereign lord, and the play hasnt bled out too far or given him a big head.  And another part, besides for the physical and emotional connection, it's just damn fun.  Picking out costumes.  Noticing things in thrift stores that make great set dressing.  It's just so fun. Sometimes the comment section in my mind sends me think pieces about how ""harem/concubine"" fantasies are problematic because real sex-trafficking victims exist.  To an extent, the thought is right, but I want to give myself permission to indulge in a taboo story because that's all it is, a story.  I do not let it color my activities outside of my partner's grasp.  I might post a different post about roleplaying taboo subjects and the shame that can set in if you dont ground yourself in the reality that it doesnt hurt anyone else what you imagine in your head while getting pounded.

jsl1ae,"Trigger warning I do mention rape, nothing detailed or graphic.   I am an 18-year-old female and also a rape victim. I was raped when I was 11 for six months almost every day at school. It has affected the way I have sex in some strange ways. I sometimes just switch off and can't feel a thing, whether it be my partner's hands on my or their dick, I just completely mentally remove myself from what is happening. I've learned when my partner is rough, extremely so, I don't switch off. I feel it's because my first sexual experience was rough or maybe because since so much is happening my mind can't leave the moment. So I encourage them to be rough and normally have to tell them to kick it up a notch. I've never told them I switch off, I worry it could make them feel as if I don't want to have sex or don't enjoy it.   I have had many abusive relationships, most of mine have been. Thankfully I have met an amazing man that makes me feel safe. Unfortunately, because I still live with my parents unless we have sex in his car he isn't rough. So almost every time we have had sex I've switched off. I have told him I've only ever almost came from oral sex and not to worry about me orgasming as I personally feel it's a mental block from trauma, but after getting my first toy I've begin, by myself to work through it.  Tonight it happened, I had my first orgasm. I burst into tears afterward from pure joy. I never thought it would happen. I had comes to terms with it. But finally beating it, finally healing from that man it feels amazing. I know it's a small step, but it feels like a big deal to me.  I almost want to tell my mother as strange as that sounds. I want to run and hug her, tell her I finally after all these years won. I am considering telling my boyfriend, as my mom would be horrified, but I worry. I am scared it will seem so trivial when to me this is one of the best days.  Honestly, I posted this here so I could share my happiness with someone. Maybe even talk to someone with a similar experience. Thank you for reading through all of this. Sorry for any spelling errors, typing this made me burst into a tearful smile. Edit: I posted this right before I went to bed and didn't think much of it, I figured I would get a comment or two. Thank you everyone for being so kind! I also just realised the typo in the title. I went to a multi-language school ( I hope that's how you put it) and while it was in the US and I live in the US, I still make little mistakes as my parents don't speak English and most of my friends these days don't, so I miss things sometimes.",Congrats on the organism,1151

jujka7,"So my Girlfriend has always been a little submissive in bed, but last night she surprised me and blindfolded me.. She told me I wasn't allowed to talk and started teasing my whole body, really taking her time with kisses all around my body. She then sucked the living soul out of me which ended in some cowgirl and through the whole time I wasnt allowed to use my hands nor talk, while blindfolded the whole time. She really enjoys how I'm going crazy with my breathing/moaning and grabbing the sheets and so on.. Im not used to being so passive, so I'm trying to figure out what I can do to make it even hotter for her, I already love it especially because she is really shy about the things that turn her on, and I really want to support her opening up to me","Recently we went to the Halloween store and I let my bf pick out a costume he liked for me. He went with a nurse, then on the way home he started giving me ideas of how he’d like to role play. Turns out he wanted to be a bit more submissive this time than he usually is.  At home he was a comatose patient and I showed up for his sponge bath. Same thing, he couldn’t move and I got to do whatever I wanted with him. It was super hot and we’ve played a few variation since. It’s one of the rare times he’s been sub and we both loved it.  So maybe explore some role play versions of her kink? For us the conversation came out of the shopping trip. Sometimes we exchange ideas while watching tv or after sex. There’s sort of a casual approach to the conversation that lets us throw around a couple of ideas and get some parameters on what either of us would be ok with, then during the session we can stay in character. Bonus, talking about it is pretty hot too.",1218
jva9ms,"I have had a strap-on I got to try pegging for quite a long time, and separately I've had a dildo because I like to watch girls as I use it on them or watch them suck it for me, but it wasn't until more recently that I decided to try just fucking someone with the strap-on. And they really actually enjoyed it quite a lot, and I enjoyed how it felt like it took away any performance anxiety or expectations on my part because they already had had like multiple penetration orgasms before I went to fuck them and at that point they were so blissed out that anything I did was just another bomb going off. To my surprise, this move has been pretty well-received by pretty much everyone I suggested it to since. While some of the fantasies I've tried to introduce often surprise me with how little interest they generate, this one seems to go over surprisingly well and the actual results are undeniably powerful. I think it's fairly common for heterosexual couples to use vibrators and dildos, but for whatever reason people haven't realized that using a dildo by humping and thrusting with it attached to you via strap-on is way way way easier for the dude, feels 1000x better for the girl (because you get to feel the guy still using his hands on your breasts or throat or ass or hips or whatever), it's easier to makeout and kiss while using the strap-on, you can use one hand to rub her clit or do whatever she likes without having to worry about that split-concentration affecting your ability to enjoy it or your erection from being affected, and obviously you don't have to worry about size or stamina. With dual-density silicone dildos, it feels squishy on the outside with a hard inner core which makes it remarkably realistic according to partners I've asked when your hands are all them and they can't see it.. Whether you: \-want to give your partner a new level of pleasure they haven't experienced \-be able to fuck them and watch their facial expressions and listen to their moans and pants and breaths without being distracted by your own pleasure before you stick your dick in and can't look too closely or it's cum-time and mission complete \-want to address insecurities about whether you are going for long enough or fast enough or are too big or too small \-want to set yourself apart and break the mold of heterosexual sex \-think it would be fun to give her earthshattering orgasms and guarantee you're the best sex she's ever had \-girl needs super slow movement or no movement and wants to just do figure eights and grind on you but you'll go soft without more friction? strap-on solves that \-girl needs super fast pace for a period of time that would make you cum three times over? strap-on solves that Consider trying it. 7/10 times she will 100% come back for more, guaranteed, sometimes. **but what do I get out of it as a dude?**: ok but for real I know many people are probably feeling the 'but what if she prefers it to me' thing, to that I say - she won't prefer the strap-on sex to you because the strap-on sex IS YOU. the whole reason it's so enjoyable is it's a sensation she would never get from using a dildo on her own (and trust me, it's not like women aren't aware of hairbrushes or cucumbers or sex stores - if just a big phallic object was all she needed then why would she bother dating you when she could go to a hardware store?). you can think about if a girl grinded her pussy on your face while using a super vacuum fleshlight on your dick, would that make you not enjoy fucking her anymore? if you try a strap-on and dildos you won't be competing against dudes with bigger dicks, you'll just now be competing with the other Michael Jordans of sex out there who are also aware of high level shit like this. also expecting some 'but I enjoy PIV because it feels good on my dick ya dingus so this sounds dumb' , but hear me out. do you finger your girl? or give her head? well those are things you do to pay it forward and give your girl some solo attention, this is in the same category. the difference is it's way fucking easier than those things and it'll make her cum 100x harder and she can still feel you kissing her neCk or making out with her or your weight on her or whatever else. this can be a 5 minute thing before you get whatever dream sex act you want from her back. if you really need pleasure, put on a vibrating cock ring or toy that vibrates your cock at a very low setting, or put in a butt plug if you're OK with anal and the thrusting will still stimulate you. finally, if you do top tier shit like this it will just motivate her to step her game up to because she'll be like damn this guy is willing to do some outside the box shit. you want her to dress up like a catgirl or give your blowjobs while you play Super Smash? well if you want catgirl sex you better be wiling to do some real avant garde shit yourself.","Excuse me, where do you place your dick while wearing the strap on?",2213
jwemiq,"So I was playing a game with some friends back home, catching up, and one of their wives I guess came into the room naked. She hopped on his mic and said ""sorry guys I really need [name] right now, enjoy your night!"". One friend laughed and said he loves when his wife does that, the other friend agreed and the conversation turned into this pissing match of ""hot things wives do"", which sounds like it could lead to overexaggerating, but knowing my friends' wives/girlfriends, I can almost guarantee isn't overexaggeration. I didn't say anything because, quite frankly, I didn't have anything to add. I ended up making up some excuse to leave and logged off.  One of the friends that I'm closer to ended up messaging me and asking if I was alright, and I just said the conversation made me a bit uncomfortable. After we chatted, I started to read back what I had written and came to the conclusion that my wife isn't sexually attracted to me.  Now for the part where I feel shitty for even thinking this: my wife is a victim of sexual assault. I knew that going in. I know nobody is entitled to sex, so it wasn't a big deal. And it wasn't like we were having no sex at all. She told me she doesn't hate sex, but the psychological trauma from the assault makes it difficult to verbalize wanting it, or to feel like she wants it without feeling shame. She doesn't masturbate, and is uncomfortable with porn, so I have next to no outlet sexually. When we do have sex, she says she's attracted to me, she's enjoying it, etc. But outside of sex, there's absolutely no sexual affection. No playful touching. No flirting. Nothing.  We went to couple's therapy to deal with it last year, and discovered she has this thing called a 'reactive libido' (which I guess means she can't initiate because arousal doesn't come to her spontaneously?), so I have to do 100% of the initiation, and thus deal with 100% of the rejection. I ask maybe twice a week, and get accepted maybe 1 - 2 times a month on a good month. Again, it's not like we're having no sex, but it would be great to have more. Or sex that doesn't feel clinical. I can't just kiss her, or touch her, and lead into sex naturally. I have to flat out just ask / message her ahead of time. Our sex is great too. Or I think it is, at least. I make sure she cums first, oral / vibrators for quite some time before we start penetration, am careful not to touch places that might trigger her, etc. She's assured me in private and in therapy that there's nothing wrong with the sex. And part of me wants to just blurt out that it must be bullshit. Outside of sex, we go on dates, walks, watch tv shows/movies, etc. If she's unhappy, then she hasn't verbalized it to me. I don't think I'm all that attractive. I've put on some weight, and my penis isn't winning any awards. I hate this gross feeling I get of feeling so unwanted and unattractive, because it's not her fault, and there's nothing I can really do about it. I'll never know what it's like for a woman to need me. I'll never know what it's like for a woman to want me to badly, they just ask for sex. I'll never know what it's like for a woman to pull me in, and kiss me, and make me feel like I'm desired. I don't know what being desired feels like, to be blunt. I feel pathetic for that even getting me down. My therapist told me I should be grateful to be having sex at all instead of focusing on this because it's not common for women to seek out men, and that my situation is more common. I guess my question is - how do I get over the fact that I will never been desired, sought after, etc., and just be grateful I'm having sex at all? Thank you for your time.

jxoev6,"My wife and I have been together for 6 years now. It’s been a wonderful marriage and I love her to death. I know that she feels the same way about me too. One of the big things we have in common is that we both love riding motorcycles. That’s actually how we met. Well about 5 months ago I got into a pretty bad wreck. I was in very bad condition for a while. I eventually started to recover but we learned that I would be permanently paralyzed from the waste down. This was heartbreaking news. It made me feel like I’d be a burden to my wife. I apologized to her and told her that I didn’t want to be a burden to her. She said I wasn’t and told me she’d do whatever she could to take care of me. I promised her that I’d learn to take care of myself so she would t have to.  So something else we definitely have in common is our love for sex. Before the accident we had a great sex life. We were both adventurous and had great chemistry in bed. We have tried to have sex after the accident, but so far it hasn’t gone so great. Half of the time I can’t get hard and the other half when I am able to I can tell that I’m not able to please her as much since she has to do all of the work. It’s really embarrassing to be that way. I just feel like a burden to her in this way as well. Recently I have gotten the idea to let her sleep around. I feel like this could possibly help out our marriage if it is done in a safe way. The boundaries would be that she’d only be able to do so with strangers, it’d have to be at our house so I knew about it, and she’d need to get testers every few months.   I haven’t told her this yet but I honestly think she could go along with it. She’s been nothing but great to me so I want to do something to help keep our marriage as strong as it always has been. So, should o go along with my plan and talk to her to see what her thoughts would be on it? If so, is there any advice on other steps to take it she does end up sleeping with other guys? I want it to be as safe as possible for her but I also want her to enjoy it. TL;DR- I want to let my wife sleep with other men since I was in an accident and have lost my abilities in bed.","Wait don’t do this. So you have becomes disabled, that’s no reason to push her away. So she does a lot more now, she loves you & still desires you. Don’t go down this path. You still have a partner who wants to please you and be pleasured by you.  Disability isn’t something that neuters you, it just. Something you have to adapt to. As for not getting hard half the time that could be the mental side of sexuality not necessarily a physical thing. If you head isn’t in the game then your body can’t follow.  Please don’t push her away. Just keep at it.  Because if she takes the option, you may well be destroyed an feel even worse, it’s a poison chalice for her too, maybe she’ll feel like sex is a burden to you, or this is an oblique way of mentioning a cuckolding fetish.  Far better would be to show her this post and have the conversation between you two, about physicality and sex and what’s going to work, rather than lobbing a pre-made solution without her input.

jzbukz,"This was like an hour and a half ago. I (17m) was home alone for the whole day. My girlfriend (18f) started sending me stuff. I told her to come over and she said she’d be there in 20 since she walks. She comes over and we immediately get into it. Literally not even a full 8 minutes and I hear the front door open. She jumps off me and grabs her clothes and runs inside my closet. I quickly put my shorts back on and acted like I was tending to my fish lol. My dad knocks then opens the door. I said “Hey papa” and he goes “Hey kid, I bought your burrito it’s in the kitchen get it now before it’s cold” I said okay and he closes the door then comes back. He said “Hey mijo?” And I asked yes? He points at the closet and goes “Get her out of there and tell her to go home” I cringe and shout no ones in there as a reflex. He laughs and goes “Kids give dads no credit, we know everything” Then he shouts “Hey Dolores!” and my girlfriend peaked out of the closet a little to wave. He smiled then closed the door. I just stood there awkwardly and confused on what even just happened. I’m wondering if he knows we had sex or if he just thinks we were hanging out. He always told me to wait til I’m in my 20s or marriage and I don’t want him to be disappointed now. Should I talk to him?

k2iu3s,"I know to many people this may not sound like a real situation, but here it is. And I am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. I dont know where else to post this.  Background on me because this is kind of important to why I made this decision: I am a very sex positive person. I am a big advocate in a better sex education in public schools and minimizing the negative stigma surrounding talking about sex to other people.  My daughter is 14 years old. She is at that age where she is becoming curious about her body and how it works. I raised my children to be very open about their questions so they do not worry too much about coming to me about these things. I want to teach her that her body is her own and she can decide what she wants to do with it. She came up to me asking about masturbation. I told her that it is normal to be curious and it is normal for people to touch themselves. She admitted that she has tried a few times, but what was concerning to me is that what she has admitted to using is not safe. It isn't sanitary. So I told her about safe practices with masturbation and I told her about different sex toys that exist. She asked me if she can get one, and I agreed. I bought her a little bullet vibrator. My husband found out about this and he was furious. He told me that she is too young to be using that, but I believe that if she is old enough to ask questions, she is old enough to be told the right information. He said im turning my daughter into someone who is easy (I dont want to say the actual work in case this post gets taken down for that) and that I should not have bought it for her.",I wouldn’t say you’re wrong. She came to you. There’s nothing wrong about helping her.  And holy Jesus effing Christ she came to you! I would never ask either of my parents anything like that. It’d be way too awkward.

k40x4b,"I (22f) got a call this beautiful Monday morning from my gyno telling me the news! I wasn’t entirely shocked to be honest. I have always played the dice when it comes to condoms. I’m on birth control so I guess I was taking that as a free ride. I thought I was being safe since the guy and I were only seeing each other during that time and he claimed that he was clean. I just wanted to post so y’all know not to be stupid like me!! I’m a big fan of doing it raw, but I’ve learned I need to be safer for both my own well being and any future partners. Stay safe and have fun (but not too much)!!","It's especially tricky for guys because they're nearly always asymptomatic for a lot of stds.

k4k7ho," ***I've posted an update***  My boyfriend and I went for a walk after dinner. We came home and started making out which lead to sex. He came and I noticed he wasn't making eye contact anymore and started tearing up. I asked him if he's ok and he said nothing. I asked him if I did something which hurt him, he said no. Then he just leaned in and hugged me really tight and wouldn't let go. I just ran my hand through his hair and patted his back and hold him ""I'm here, I love you, everything's ok."" I don't know what happened. We've been together for 2 years. I got him water and then we just cuddled. He fell asleep in my arms. It's currently 4am and I just whispered to him ""I'm right here, I'm just going to the washroom.""  I'm worried somethings wrong. I thought I should hop on here and ask for advice. Should I wait until he brings it up or ask him in the morning? Could it be cause of school? We both have finals next week and have been stressed out but I don't know if guys cry during sex because of that.","You took good care of him.  I'd talk to him about it for sure. Maybe wait and see if he mentions it himself.  I've heard of women crying after they cum too, as part of emtional release. It could be many reasons. It may not even be one thing, but multiple reasons.",4767
k5h20a,"Any suggestions? Update: I’m at the ER waiting for an X-RAY. Please y’all, do NOT use things that are not meant for your butt. It’s not worth it. I’m so disappointed in myself because this could have easily been avoided. Update 2: They could see it in the X-ray and they said it’s pretty low in the rectum (thank god). The doc is going to perform a rectal exam and remove by hand/using an instrument. Update 3: The doc did the rectal exam and wasn’t able to retrieve it. OH MY GOD IT FKN HURT. He could see it but the object is in such a difficult position; making it difficult to retrieve. I will have to go through a more invasive procedure. This fkn sucks guys. I THANK you all for pushing me to go into the ER. This could have escalated terribly. Wow! thanks for the attention and awards guys! I did not expect my post to gain this much traction. My interaction with all of you has certainly made my situation better. I am still waiting for surgery to call the doc back. Update 4: surgery dept called back and is doing my case today. I just finished taking the COVID test (OMG ALSO)  and I am now awaiting transport. Thanks for your support everyone. You all are really making this process easier. Update 5: This all feels like a dream, or nightmare I should say. I am still in my room waiting for the COVID test to come back. Once that happens, I will finally go through a minimally invasive surgery🤣. Again, THANK YOU ALL. I have been on Reddit for the past hour, reading all of your comments and replying. I will update y’all more soon. You all are legends in my eyes 🤙 Update 6: 40 mins later,  I’m about to go into the OR. See y’all later.  Update 7: I’m in the post op room and they got it out without any complications. YAY! I’m feeling very groggy and I’m awaiting for my ride to pick me up. The general anesthesia was crazy.  Although I should be happy for not having any surgical complications, I shouldn’t even be here in the first place! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, take this post as a lesson for everyone to use proper sex toys. I literally have just gone through hell for something so stupid and unnecessary.  Hey everyone. It’s 4AM, and I just got home. This has been a wild ride. I’m reading through this post, and my god you guys are funny. Y’all really helped me get through this so I appreciate every single upvote, comment, and award. I am feeling no effects from the procedure except a little bloating. I’m still a little groggy.  If this ever happens to you, please please seek medical attention. Take deep breaths and don’t panic. You can try to fish it out with your fingers but please be sure to not push it in further like I did. As soon as you don’t feel it with your fingers, brave up and go to the ER. Taking a laxative may help or push it even deeper. I initially planned to wait and poop it out or pull it out but you guys really encouraged me to go to the ER. All of you honestly might have saved me from terrible terrible health consequences. I have learned my lesson and will never ever ever stick anything up my ass besides sex toys. I hope this post saves someone from potentially doing the same thing.  Stay safe everyone, and enjoy responsibly.   Note: Some of you don’t know if I’m M or F. I am a straight male who likes butt play. So being in the hospital is even more awkward than it has to be. Why can’t I reply to comments anymore?","If it doesn't come out within the next 1-2 hours or so (that's just the time frame I'd give myself before I'd realize its not gonna come out on its own), unfortunately that's an ER room visit.

k71gjv,"Ok so I (29M) am married to my wife (30F). We have been married for 6 years. Lately she only wants to have sex once every other month.  She also doesnt like it when I Matsurbate but thats beside the point. Anyways this is the second time she has seemed disinterested in me. But this time around i am absolutely clueless on what to do about it. I talk to my wife about her feelings. I talk to her about my feelings. I talk to her about what she wants to talk about. I make time for her. I help around the house. I help with the kids. I plan dates. I work 60 hrs a week 5am to 5pm M-F. So that she can be a stay at home Mom which is what she wanted. She used to look at me differently. When I talked to her I was able to be Vulnerable and so was she. Now she is walled off. When I make time to do things like rub her back, shoulders, or feet she will gkadly accept but I cant remember tge last time she touched me sweetly. When I make time for her she tells ne she wants to be alone and will disappear with her phone and tablet. O try snuggling her on the couch. Watching movies and stuff rrying to bond. I do dishes. I do Laundry. I try to make her life easier. I deal with the kids when i het home so she doesnt have to. I put the kids to bed. I plan date nights. I call her during rhe day to see how she is doing. All these things show her I care about her. Now I feel like she is just Jaded to me. Im starting to suspect when she goes to the gym she is meeting someone. That when she retreats to be alone she is texting or sexting him. I convey my feelings that something is wrong. That something is off. But she says she is happy then acts like thats all that matters. Idk how she can be happy while I am feeling sad and alone.","She needs to know that even though she says she's happy, the way she is acting is making you unhappy, and that is unbalanced. Go see a therapist. If she won't go with you, let her know you need to go alone anyway. It may help you (or both of you if she wants to do the right thing) gain some clarity and address any big issues that come up with a neutral person present who can mediate and offer strategies/steer the conversation in the right direction. *Edit: Therapy is not just a solution to keep unhappy couples together. It could also help OP process through what might be a tough realization to leave. Also, looking into benefits from your job and if they offer an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) initial therapy sessions are free. In my experience with this, our therapist kept the case open (and covered by insurance) longer because she needed more than what was covered at first (5 sessions in my case) to have a chance at resolving the problem.",2835
k8sffb,"nothing frustrates me more than when im about to orgasm and the guy starts jackhammering or slowing down to a stop or worse, ending penetration altogether to suck my clit. when the latter happened to me i actually yelled at him.  It’s almost like they automatically think they need to stall my orgasm like we stall theirs. if that’s not it, why do you guys do that? thoughts? edit: whoa this kinda blew up didn’t it?  here’s what i’ve learned from the comments: saying “i’m gonna cum” is hot and makes men cum so they try to avoid it so they don’t ruin it for us and end up ruining it anyway. so it’s best to just say don’t stop or not say anything at all, or give clear instructions","When I was younger I'd hear someone say they were about to cum and my lizard brain would take over with the mentality of ""if wat i do is good, more of wat i doing = gooder"" or some stupid shit along those lines and I'd start going faster/deeper/etc. and fuck it up.",4384
k9wm1i,"I (43f) am a principal at a high school in Colorado. Recently, there was a meeting about improving sex Ed. I heard that Vermont would be the first state to require secondary schools to provide condoms in the nurses office. I thought it was a fantastic idea. We, as in the staff, superintendent and district, voted to provide free condoms in the nurse’s office for juniors and seniors. We sent a poll out to the parents emails. 61% voted yes and 39% votes no. Meaning there will be many, many upset parents but teens can not be stopped and it’s much better if they are able to protect themselves. I have caught a few students having sex in the bathroom. Typically they are supposed to be suspended, punished, etc- but they would beg me not to tell their parents with legit fear in their eyes. I realized then that they are the products of strict parenting which pushed them to have sex in unsafe places. So I would not tell their parents but I would subject them to consequences like volunteering in the office instead of getting lunch break for a week or so. So- Free condoms will be in the nurse’s office for juniors and seniors. Students can come by and pick them up, no comments needed from either side. This will go into effect after Christmas break. Should we add or do anything else? I was thinking about booklets that will let students know where they can get cheap/free resources if they aren’t comfortable with going to the nurse. Should we print and administer those as well? There is a sex Ed crisis in American society and it needs to be combatted. Edit: People are bringing up inclusivity. We have many LGBT students attending! My son, hes 17, is bisexual and I had to educate myself on sex Ed for LGBT teens. A couple of people have mentioned dental dams. I will see about that. Should lube be included as well for lgbt boys? Another edit: Many people have stated that keeping them with the nurse might discourage students. I will talk with the staff about placing them in bathrooms.","If you want to improve sex-ed, make a way for a student to anonymously ask a question whether it be with a note or whatever, and have a plane with all the questions and answers in the lobby or the toilets or halls, wherever every 2 weeks. Edit:  Also wanted to ask you since you are a pretty young principal, have you watched and if yes, what do you think about the netflix show Sex Education and specifically what do you think about the principal of the school in the show?",2677
kap18e,"So I'm a guy, and throughout my whole life I've never really been on the receiving end of lust. In all of my relationships and sexual experiences, it's always been me initiating, complimenting, and expressing my sexual interest, and it's been super draining because it doesn't fit me.  I'm shy, I'm not the best at reading people, I hate the complex and awkward dance of trying to decide if they're reciprocating interest, if they're doing it for me or because they want to. I never ever want to pressure people into sex (or anything really), and I hate the idea of sex with someone who isn't just as eager as I am. I'm good at making that judgement at this point, but there's always uncertainty that maybe they're not in the mood but are going along with it. I just want to experience sex without the anxiety that I feel when I have to initiate.  So for once in my life I want to be lusted after. I want my partner to grab my butt, kiss me, throw me into bed, make me feel sexy. I want to know that my partner *wants* me, I want to see the hunger in their eyes. But it feels so unattainable. I've dated wonderful people who I've really connected with sexually, but still haven't found this. It seems to still always fall to me, and at this point I feel a bit resigned that partnered sex will always just be kinda subpar because of my apparent default role.  Are my expectations unrealistic? How do I even seek this out? I guess I'm just looking for advice on how I can approach dating, etc so that I don't always have to initiate everything.","Have you ever communicated this to your partner? I know it seems like it should be a given that both men and women want to be desired and lusted after by their partner, but generally it seems most men and women naturally fall into more traditional dominant and submissive roles. For a lot of women I don’t think it occurs to them that men want to be pursued and openly lusted after, so you might need to explicitly tell them you like that and want it.",977
kaunht,"I love my sleep but meh, I’m down for trying new stuff. For no reason my body jerked its self wide awake at 3am I figured it’s as good a time as any. So I started with some soft kisses up his neck to his cheek till I reached his mouth as I slowly climbed over him coming to a missionary mount right on top of him. Hard and welcoming the kisses seemingly half-asleep he suddenly jerks up and says wait. Startling me I come to an abrupt halt still perched on his lap I leaned back and waited. He grabbed the bed side clock and paused, “...babe, it’s 3am..”  Me:”...yea but you said you wanted to try so..” Him:”yea but it’s 3am tho...let’s just do it again in the morning?” Me: “ok well at least we know it’s not our thing haha” Him:”heh yea.” Said our goodnights again snuggled up and immediately got slammed by sleep.  In this relationship we learned sleep is more important than sex. Don’t be afraid to try new things. Next time we’re trying some bondage heh.","Hahaha that sounds like the most adult response ever and it's great. ""It's sleep or sex, choose! I choose sleep.""",1529
kb8d5z,"So.. School was canceled today because of the weather. My daughter is 17 and she’s a senior. Her boyfriend is like 17 or 18 I’m pretty sure and he’s also a senior. My daughter has anxiety and when she was 13, we built a treehouse for her. Only she goes in it. It’s her space to cool down or be alone, especially since we have 4 younger kids and at her age she wants privacy. Two hours ago I was looking for my daughter because she wasn’t in the house. Usually she texts me if she’s in the treehouse but I didn’t get a text so I was worried. So I went out to our backyard and started approaching the tree house. I get halfway up the stairs and see her and her boyfriend going at it. I walked back down but yelled up to them. It got awkwardly silent and then I heard a lot of movement- i assume they were putting their clothes back on. They came out and the three of us stood there awkwardly. I told her boyfriend I liked his hair. He said thanks. I nodded. He nodded. We looked  away awkwardly. I asked them if they were using a condom. They said yes. I said “Good, now go home or come inside, how are y’all even ignoring this weather?” After that we went inside. I kept my distance from them because I am temporarily traumatized. (But to be fair, my wife and I caused our daughter to feel the same way a couple months ago when she walked in on us. So I guess it’s equal now)  I grew up in a home where girls were treated differently from boys. Girls got stricter rules and got punished for the same thing boys did. I saw how my dad treated my sister vs how he treated me and it made my sister resent him. I decided that I’d be opposite with my girls. I also know that teenagers will have sex regardless of how you feel about it, so it’s better to make sure they are safe rather in the forest somewhere with no protection. But... I still need a drink lol. I guess the next step is asking my daughter if she wants to go on birth control? Or just another safe sex talk??","You handled it well I think. You didn't intentionally make her feel uncomfortable (it was uncomfortable on its own, but you didn't add to it) you made sure they were being safe, and you gave them some space to get over the obvious awkwardness. I honestly don't think you could've done anything else to make it any less uncomfortable than it needed to be.",4764
kc1n00,"so for the better part of two years (18-19) i have had vaginismus due to sexual trauma which basically means that penetration is near impossible or at the least very very painful because the muscles of the vagina tighten up in sexual situations to “protect” from unwanted, or even wanted, penetration. i just dealt with the fact and abstained from any penetration including not even being able to use tampons because it hurt when anything was inserted, no matter the size of the object. i never used any toys or even my own fingers for penetration and clarified to any sexual partners that it was an absolute no-go during this time, so i kind of forgot what it even felt like to have something up there.  so fast forward to a couple months ago i had an intimate encounter with a girl and things escalated, she was touching me all over and i was so aroused i barely even noticed that she had slipped a finger inside and when i did i got so happy that my body didn’t choose to tighten up like so many times before so i didn’t even allow myself to feel anxious or scared... i was honestly almost at the verge of tears because i felt so connected to her in that moment. she managed to do something i hadn’t even been able to do alone for such a long time because of the disorder.  after that night i still had moments when the disorder came back, i wasn’t fully cured yet and i still got anxious and would tighten up even with this same girl a couple of times if we moved too fast, but i was getting better all the while.  at the peak of my disorder i genuinely thought i would never do penetration again and i was completely fine with that, but now i have completely changed my mind. it can feel absolutely incredible when done right and i highly recommend any women who don’t quite enjoy it fully to work around it and keep exploring different things to do with a partner or alone with a toy.  i would never quite understand when women would say they “crave their boyfriend’s dick inside of them” because i never craved anything inside of me, but now i get it, lol.",awww :) something on reddit finally made me smile,589

kedoon,"I don't really have anyone I feel I can tell this to, so I'd like to share with you guys. Maybe hear some similar experiences from people. Over the last 1.5 months I've made big diet and excersize changes, meaning I'm down 30 lbs over that period. I'm lighter now than I've been in a long time (since far before my sexual debut), and had a realization yesterday; my balls are leaner. My dick even looks bigger since it's got less fat around it. I've only really been thinking about the health benefits of losing weight, not the difference it would make to my sex life (once there's no longer a pandemic and I can start dating again). But it's going to be so different I can feel already. I'm far from where I want to be, but I already feel better with myself and much more confident with my sex appeal. Anyway, wanted to share.  EDIT; HOLY SHIT, this blew up in a way I did not expect. Thank you for the awards and upvotes! I've gotten a lot of similar questions of what I did so adding a bit more back story and weight loss info. I had very good health reasons to lose weight. I've long been overweight and struggling with depression. I've made strides in losing weight from my heaviest point, but now I had even bigger medical reasons to lose weight even quicker. High blood pressure and several weight related issues like gout and sleep apnea. I was up for a gastric sleeve surgery, but I felt I was getting a lot of conflicting info from medical staff. So I tried some of the low calorie diet that you were supposed to go on before the surgery, and while the first week was hell, I then quickly realized that didn't need to eat as much as usual and still have energy.  Mostly it's eating proper, healthy breakfast and dinner. Not too much sugars, good amount of greens for dinner always, som simple ones for breakfast as well. Then three really small meals during the day, like 200-300 calories each. Not special stuff just healthy things. Cut way down on snacks and candy. The stuff I do take I put in a really small bowl, think ashtray or smaller. Drink a lot of water. Also get on the exercise bike at least 10 minutes a day, been keeping it to 30 minutes or more for the most part though. It's done way more than I thought it would. Honestly it is as simple as making sure to take in less calories than you burn. I never thought I'd be one of those people, but it does work. EDIT 2; I'm at work and can't really keep up with the replies. Several people have been concerned about the rapid weight loss, and I don't think you realize how big I've been. I'm 6'3, pretty stocky build by genetics. In 2013 I was at my biggest, then I successfully lost more over a few years until plateauing at 340. Managed a bit more, but nothing changed much until I went on this new diet and dropped from 330 down to nearly 300. I've BEEN FAT. For a long time. I'm fine. I'm losing at a slower rate than I would have with a gastric sleeve operation.",The conversation on this topic has run its course. Comments locked.,2623
kf2vtq,"Ok bare with me. I've never felt anything like this. I've been seeing this girl from work. She is so smart and beautiful but she has low confidence and I have no idea why because she's perfect.  We slept together a few times but it was always a drink filled night.  This morning she was up early stoking my face while I was half asleep tired from a late night. We are laying there naked and she is touching me so I'm half hard.  She climbs on top grabs me at the base and gets my cock just hard enough to slide it in. She tells me to wait then whispers in my ear she wants to feel me get hard.  Ok. This is hard to explain. Without moving she starts squeezing and pulsing stroking my cock from the inside. No movement just holding down my hands and pulsing on my cock which starts to swell.  As I grow inside her she gasps and makes the sexiest noise I've ever heard.  By the time she starts to slide up and down on me I explode after a few seconds and she whimpers and whispers in my ear thank you. No no sweetie, thank you. We laid like that for what must have been an hour.  What the fuck just happened?",They’re called Kegels. The muscles inside the vagina can be contracted and a lot of women can do those types of “exercises” throughout the day so they have a really strong “squeeze”. I’ve heard some girls can literally push a guy right out of her from those muscles tightening when having an orgasm.,4349
kfjtdh,"If you’ve ever had a U-spot orgasm, you know exactly what I’m talking about. If you haven’t had one, I HIGHLY suggest you get familiar.  The first time this happened to me, both my partner and I had no idea what had happened. I explained that it “felt like a G-spot orgasm but from the outside” That’s the best way I can describe it. So we started researching and came across quite a few articles about what is referred to as the “U-spot”. It’s a lesser-known pleasure spot right between your clit and the opening to the vagina (in close proximity to the urethra) that when simulated, can cause extremely powerful orgasms. For me, this was discovered during oral sex but I have also been able to achieve this on my own with a wand. Though, at the beginning, I was only able to get off at this spot AFTER having a clitoral orgasm but now that is no longer necessary. I figured I’d share this information for the ladies who may not know about it and also see if there are any who have discovered it??  ETA: thank you for the awards! I didn’t expect this post to blow up the way it did but hopefully that means a lot of women out there will be having better orgasms! Haha Also, I understand that this is “jUsT pArT oF tHe cLiT” BUT it’s an unconventional spot that produces a stronger orgasm (in my opinion) and I hadn’t found it until I was 29 so I figured more women ought to know about it ‍♀️","When my wife is masturbating with her Pocket Rocket, all I have to do is come up from her vagina with my index finger to right under her clit. I can feel the vibrator and with a little applied pressure there, she turns into a screamer. Every time.... Good thing we live in the country. She screams, the dog starts barking. She's bucking begging for it to stop, saying ""no more, no more""!  I really think she might pass out some of the time, it's so intense. Love it.....",3203
kg2r8u," Big title, but I mean it literally: Most of the time, when I have a deep orgasm, I am transported into a vision while I come. They’re often random and not connected to my life, though sometimes they’re riffing off of events or anxieties. The best way I can describe them is flashes of dreams that are quick, but often so immersive that I forget where I am and what just happened. Then I’ll crash back and remember I just came.   A little bit more about me. I’m a 26 year old woman with a pretty high sex drive. I love making myself come and partly I think it’s because of the visions lol. They don’t happen as much when I’m with a partner.  Once I read this was sexual synesthesia. Some people see colors when they come or have other sensations. I’ve never really verbalized this because I’m scared if I acknowledge them they’ll go away! And they’re such adventures!

kgtc16,"The previous relationship lasted 3 years, the one before that 1 year, and same for the one before that. None have managed to make me orgasm through oral sex. I couldn’t describe what went wrong. Fingering was no problem as long as I did it myself. They didn’t listen properly when I told them what to do. Lots of stupid shit like them putting 3-4 fingers inside me just because they could, even though I told them not to because it feels weird as hell, or them drawing the alphabet with their tongue (WHY?). The most recent ex claimed he had made many women orgasm before and suggested the problem was on my end, that maybe I was just physically unable to do it. Well, turns out he was wrong. I can orgasm from oral sex. And I did. Many times. So just throwing this out for anyone out there who feels inadequate because of their inability to orgasm from oral- your partner might be the problem, not you!","Oral sex is a **re-learned** skill.  Meaning, it doesn't matter if they made 1 or 10 partners before you orgasm, there is no global oral technique and they need to learn what works for you, which might be vastly different than what the other partner's needed. Your ex had an ego problem and it was easier for them to blame you than admit they didn't have a magic technique that worked on everyone.

The two of us are pretty comfortable complimenting other people's looks without sabotaging each other's self confidence. Things kind of escalated though when I ended up agreeing with her. My exact words were ""not gonna lie, that is a stunning specimen"".  My girlfriend teasingly asked ""since when do you find guys attractive?"". I interpreted that question as playful banter, so I joked and said ""straight doesn't mean I'm blind to good looking men"". My girlfriend, who was snuggled up against me on the couch, slowly proceeded to rub the inside of my thigh before asking what I would do if the guy in the commercial was doing that to me. At that moment I wasn't really sure if she was just being seductive or checking to see if I'm gay. Either way, I was getting turned on. So to answer her question, I said ""If his hands were as good as yours I wouldn't stop him"". My girlfriend reached into my pants and asked me what else I would let him do.  Not gonna lie, I said some gay shit. I came inside my girlfriend's mouth while describing how I'd spread open another dude's ass and eat his butthole. My girlfriend was literally blushing afterwards. She said it was hot.  I have two questions.  1) If I had to put a label on this experience, what would it be?  2) Now that the homo-erotic door has been opened, what else can I do in that department?  **TL:DR Dirty talk between my girlfriend and I had a gay plot twist. It turned us both on. Now I'm just looking for some answers.**","I’m a bisexual woman and I find the idea of two men having sex extremely erotic. So do many of my female friends. Also don’t worry about any of that stuff becoming a rabbit hole towards being completely homosexual like it’s a linear path. Not that there’s anything wrong with that either. There are lots of bisexual heteroromatic people and I’d say that you could fall into that category if you wanted to experiment. The bisexual aspect being in variating degrees. Sometimes it’s just a fantasy without even wanting to be with a man irl.  You can try sucking a dildo, you or her cross dressing, you being pegged, anal on her etc. then of course there’s the idea of a threesome but that’s if it’s okay with all parties involved. Life’s too short to worry about this stuff too much. Just have fun and feel free to explore this as much as you two like. ",4489
kipbek,"So a few weeks ago, I went on a date with this guy, he invited me over (just cause it's corona and we had nowhere else to go) and after some time, we started making out. I told him I wasn't ready for sex because I barely knew him and he said that that was perfectly okay and that we can still continue making out. So we did, took some clothes off, we were almost naked and then he asked me again if I really didn't want to have sex and I said that no, really, it's too soon. Everything was okay to that point but then he told me it was really hard for him to stop and that he hopes that I appreciate him for not having sex with me. He also said that a lot of guys would just continue and claimed that he was the nice guy cause he didn't have sex with me although we were both almost naked. I didn't mean to be provocative or tease him or whatever so I felt really bad about it but then I thought.. This guy just wanted my gratitude because he respected my boundaries??! Was he really considering violating my trust because if he had continued.. that would have been a rape, right? So I was just thinking, was it that weird to just make out being almost naked? Is it that hard for a guy to stop or was this one just a prick? Edit: Thanks for all your comments, I didn't expect so many of them! Thank you for all the opinions and I just want to say that I resolved not to see this guy again even prior to this post. It just doesn't feel safe. He didn't have to mean what he said, to be honest, I don't think he is a rapist but probably just wanted to make me feel guilty because he was disappointed I didn't change my mind. Still not okay.   A lesson I learned: Be more careful, don't go into strangers' houses, and look for the genuinely nice guys because they are out there and I can see them here in the comment section. Some of you are not into intense making out if it doesn't lead anywhere, that's also good to know.   Something to tell you: If she says no, you can be the one who determines how far you go, don't blame her for going too far, you can also stop it whenever you feel like it's getting too heated. Girls, if you say no and then change your mind as the emotions kick in or you actually want the guy to push you, you make it harder for the rest of us who really mean our no as a no.   Thank you again, stay safe and Merry Christmas :)","It's a weird mindset expecting praise for doing the bare minimum to not commit a crime so yeah I do t think you're wrong here. I had the opposite situation once, I happened to bump into a girl I knew once on a night out, she was approaching black out drunk, had got separated from her friends, no phone or cash on her so I offered to take her back home with me. Essentially took her to my room, put her on the bed and went to sleep on the sofa. The next day she thanked me for not trying to have sex with her and that made me feel very weird",4468
kjlyi3,"TLDR: Plan B is NOT something to take lightly. You cannot just ask a woman to take it like she's popping an advil. If you can't use a condom + she's not on BC then don't have sex. I (21F) had sex with a guy (23M) a couple months ago and the condom wasn't fitting him properly so he asked if we could have sex without it and he could pay me back for Plan B. I knew it was a bad idea and really wanted to say no. However I've had bad experiences in the past with an ex boyfriend who would get really pissed if I didn't want to take plan B (I wouldn't want to for valid reasons) so I felt too scared/pressured to say no, and ended up just saying yes. Well, now I'm here over two months later and my period has been missing (I had a withdrawal bleed after taking it, I'm not pregnant). I can't explain how frustrating dealing with irregular periods is, esp bc I've already been dealing with a hormonal condition the past few years and was just starting to repair and regulate my cycles. Now I'm worried I've fucked it up all over again. Plan B has a fuck ton of progesterone that really affects a woman's cycle and hormonal system and overall health. I've learned my lesson now and will never say yes to taking it just to have sex one time but I really want all men (and women) to understand that it's not something to be taken lightly. Please do not treat it like some over the counter medication that has no effect. Listen to the woman in your life if she tells tell you she doesn't want to take it and absolutely do not pressure her into it.","While PSA/rant/essay-type posts are generally disfavored here — see the **Forum Rules**, and especially **Posting Guideline #10** — this post merits a one-time exception to those rules, for now.

kld3jo,Due to sexual abuse when I was younger I still have a lot of hangups about sex and I’m trying to figure my body out. I don’t feel comfortable explaining it to him.

klsrfq,"My(F20) partner (M21) decided to try something new and it started off with me eating his ass which he liked and moved on to me putting a finger in and then almost a second one and he orgasmed. This is the first time he has finished so quickly (usually takes between 30-60 mins even with penetrative sex and he never orgasms just from head) but with this he jerked off a bit and with the stimulation he came in 15 mins.  After that he had a weird look on his face, got up immediately and went to the bathroom and when he came back he wouldn’t even look at me. I tried to get him to open up and he said that he liked it but he’s angry and feels disgusting for liking it. I told him I won’t bring it up again unless he wants to try it again at some point and he replied saying he would do it again in an instant he just feels so disgusting and emasculated for liking it.  I tried telling him that our bodies are weird and why should we limit ourselves when there is so much pleasure to be found everywhere and doing anything for the first time is an emotional experience but he wouldn’t even look at me or say anything and within the next 30 mins he just told me he needs to go and went back to his place.  I think this may be stemming from his upbringing (we are both from very strict Asian backgrounds) and it sucks seeing him feel so disgusted with himself when it’s something he just found out he enjoys. I want him to be happy and feel good and I’ve never seen him feel this way about himself especially when it comes to sexual things How do I handle this without making the situation worse ? EDIT: Thank you everyone so much, I never expected this kind of attention and help. I was super lost with this whole situation and you guys helped figure out how to be a better and more supportive partner in this regard, really appreciate it!","Sounds like he's suffering from a bad case of butt stuff = gay. But there is a positive in there, he said he ""would do it again in an instant"". I guess if this is something you'd like to do again or explore further you're gonna need to convince him that you do not see it as an emasculating act, you just see it as another way to bring pleasure to your partner. I don't know how clued up on biology he is but explaining that the prostate gland (which is often referred to as the male G spot) is most easily accessed anally, the reason he felt so good and came so quickly is a biological reason and nothing to do with his preconceived idea of butt stuff = gay.",3061

kn6yy3,"My husband (M33) and I (F32) haven't been connecting in the bedroom lately. We've been together 8 years, but this last year it feels like we've lost our mojo.  So after endless conversations and troubleshooting, we're trying to get back to our fun sexual selves. Well I've been feeling absolutely fantastic. I've been wearing some of my sexy clothes around the house and have been trying to initiate sexting. I've been flirting and touching whenever I can. We have been having more sex, and it is more fulfilling and fun.  I decided to record myself masturbating. I watched videos of solo girls masturbating to try to get good ideas for positions. I had a fucking blast. I looked sexy as hell. I loved watching myself, and seeing how wet I was getting. I played with several different toys, tried different positions and I orgasmed twice.  My husband didn't really care. He watched it (or parts of it) and lightly masturbated but then moved on to something else. Alright, he wasn't that into it. That's fine. I felt a bit let down, because I felt so confident and sexy. I kept thinking about it, and I'd watch part of the video throughout the day.  Well yesterday I decided to record myself again. He doesn't know (and probably wouldn't be interested), and I feel so hot and horny. I'm a fucking sexy woman and I fucking love pleasuring myself and being recorded and watched.  I do wish he was more into it, or found me as sexy as I feel. Although he might not appreciate me, I appreciate myself and love being intimate with myself.  Is this something I should talk to him about or should I just keep having fun on my solo adventure?",You need to tell him that he has given you the impression that he isn't that into you anymore. Address that shit fast or it will fester really bad. &#x200B; He probably doesn't mean to present that to you and is unconscious of it.,1771

kp6a7s,"I (F26) have always liked a specific type of men: I always go for shy guys, they just attract me like no one else. And slender, slightly feminine AND shy guys? That you have to approach since they will just look at you, go red but are too afraid to talk to you first? Oh yes please, I will do the talking. But I’ve noticed there is a lot of stigma here on reddit on this particular topic, I’ve seen some people making a post about it here or in other subs and getting straight up attacked or accused of “fetishizing” people. Is it not normal? I think it’s literally “having a type” and everyone has at least one.","\> “fetishizing” people     &#x200B; This is most likely coming from people who are looking to be offended and interpret everything in the worst possible way. It's a reddit disease. Fetishizing exists, but on reddit you're fetishizing if you're not following mainstream beauty standards. And if you do, then you're addicted to and brainwashed by porn and the media with no idea what ""real women"" look like. It's fine to have preferences.   &#x200B; Another thing on here is that people think in boxes. Being shy means lacking confidence in social situations. And people then conclude that being not confident in one area of life must mean that the person is horribly insecure in every single aspect of life.  On reddit, once you're insecure in any way, you're also manipulative (out of fear of losing the partner), need therapy (for that behaviour), gaslight your partner (again, fear), probably can't love them (as you're too obsessed with yourself), are unloveable yourself (who can love a person who doesn't love him/herself?) and a bunch of other assumptions that people pull straigt out of their behinds.    &#x200B; So basically, reddit gets offended over nothing and makes a problem out of everything.

kplrqk,"TL;DR: Bought condoms from a different brand, they were too small, ruined my night and now I'm angry. I just moved to a new place, wanted to grab some condoms but my local store did not have the brand I used to buy. Since I always bought the basic ""classic"" condoms I just grabbed the ""classic"" ones from another popular brand. A few weeks later I was ended up with a nice woman in my bed and tried to put a condom but it just did not work. After 30 seconds of pulling and sweating it was finally on, but a few minutes later my dick went flaccid. I was so confused and after minutes of trying to get hard again I told my partner that we have to dispense with the penetrative part of our naughty activities. The next day I gave it another try, this time alone, without any pressure (Should have done this before). The condoms were definitely smaller (probably too small) than the ones I used to buy. After some googling if found out that the condoms I used to buy have a 56mm diameter and the new ones only 52mm, both labeled as ""Classic"". The next time I was in the near local supermarket, I spent quite some time in front of the condom shelf and inspected most packages looking for one with a ""real size"" of 56 mm. It took a while and i already got some weird looks from the staff working there. Most of the brands do not even have the size printed on the packages, I had to google like 70% of them. The fact that most brands use non-benchmark terms for measurements where precision is actually important confuses me. I do not say the cant use them anymore, but at least they could print the actual size on the package. Also I wont forget again trying unknown condoms first alone in a solo mission. Edit:  Turns out I just picked a brand which makes condoms for a tighter fit. Changed to another brand and the ""normal"" size fits. Edit2: Never thought I'd learn so much about condoms in one day. Edit3: I know how and where to buy condoms, it was just a rant about condom brands not labeling the size of their products well visible on the packaging. Edit4: Turns out buying condoms is a lot like buying women clothes. The difference is you can bring the clothes back if they do not fit, the condoms on the other hand...",This isn't a new problem...NASA even had to deal with it: [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spacesuit-envy/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spacesuit-envy/),2237

krofv6,"A year ago I (20m) made the decision to tell my parents I'm gay. A week ago my dad made the decision to surprise me with a female sex worker (25) for my birthday. If that sounds weird to you, you're normal. If it doesn't, welcome to my world. My old man gave me the whole ""nothing beats pussy"" speech before leaving me alone in the house with a random stranger. I was so embarrassed and awkward I didn't know how to react. The sex worker introduced herself as ""Zoey"" and encouraged me to relax. Without wasting time I apologized and made it clear that I'm not interested in girls. Zoey asked me a bunch of questions about my sexuality. Questions I never had to answer out loud before. Her attitude seemed really sincere. Like she genuinely just wanted to learn about my life. The two of us ended up having a good time talking. However, talking turned into touching, and touching turned into my first sexual experience with another person. As soon as we were both naked, Zoey wrestled me onto my stomach and started humping my butt. She humped me harder and harder without slowing down. Even though nothing was penetrating me, the feeling off getting pounded from behind was enough to send me over the edge. I came from that alone. Nothing touched my penis. Didn't even know that was possible! It wasn't over though. I wanted to be inside Zoey. I'll be honest, it felt amazing. It made me question everything I thought I knew about my sexual orientation. It's been a week and I still have no idea what to make of it. My dad is now convinced I was never actually gay and that all I needed was the right woman to remind me I'm as straight as they come. Is my dad right?  Can you be gay and still enjoy sex with girls?  Even now I don't feel any sexual attraction towards other girls, but when I think about Zoey it makes me excited.

kufto3,"Last night I (19m) had my first threesome. Two guys and one girl. Guy #2 (25) was my roommate and the girl (25) was his fianceé. The two of them approached me with the idea for a MFM threesome and pitched it as a win win situation for all of us. On one hand they'll get to explore their kinky side with someone they trust and on the other hand I get to lose my virginity in the company of two experienced people who know me. Not gonna lie, awkwardly losing my virginity in front of two people, especially two people who are my friends, one of which who lives with me, made my asthma flair up. But they ended up making me feel comfortable enough to agree to it. Fast forward to my roommate and I cumming all over his fianceé. She was face down / ass up on the bed. Butt cheeks covered in nut juice. Without thinking I licked all that cum off her ass. Mine as well as my roommate's. I flipped her over and kissed her before swallowing the load. She licked my lips when we were done kissing which kinda turned me on all over again. My roommate pretended like he was gonna throw up and joked about how gross that was. I pretended like I was gonna kiss him too and he literally ran out of the bedroom lol. It was all fun and games. Or so I thought.  This morning my roommate called me gay for being so willing to not only swallow my own cum, but also his cum. His entire attitude was different now. According to him, the only reason he played it so cool at the time was because his fianceé seemed to enjoy it. He said both of us behaved inappropriately by kissing each other in a way that made it impossible for him to participate. I apologized and made it clear that my intention was never to make anyone feel uncomfortable or left out. He said he won't hold it against me because it was my first time, but advised me never to do that again because it's not really something straight guys do. I asked him if we're cool and all he said was he can no longer look at me the same way knowing I had his cum in my mouth.  1. Did I cross the line? 2. Is swallowing cum somehow not for straight guys? **Edit:** Never expected this post to attract so much attention! I appreciate all the advice and the praise, but it wouldn't be fair if I didn't point out how much I learned from my roommate and his fianceé during the threesome. I wasn't the sex machine some of you seem to think I was nor was my roommate a complete asshole. I had my fair share of performance anxiety throughout, but my roommate and his fianceé were patient and helpful towards me until I finally managed to just enjoy the experience. Thanks to the two of them I learned to focus on how good the sex was and gain the confidence to actually do what I did without thinking about what it means for my sexuality or the potential gross factor that comes with it. So in spite of how things turned out, I'm grateful that my first sexual experience was with them. Speaking of gratitude though, these comments are really educational and entertaining, so thank you! Didn't know my story would turn on so many people. It's a bit overwhelming. For those who doubt any of this even happened, I get it, it's the internet, but thanks for reading though. So long, virginity!","If they didn’t put any rules in place beforehand, then no you did not cross a line.  It doesn’t mean you’re gay.

kvpueh,"My gf (25) and I (22m) haven't had sex yet. Not with each other. Not with anyone. For religious reasons she wants to remain a virgin until her honeymoon night. My initial reaction was like ""sucks, but fair enough, her choice, lemme see where this goes"". For the record, my reason for being a virgin has nothing to do with any religion. I've just been too socially inept to make sufficient attempts to actually have sex. However, the one time I did man up and approach a girl, it happened to be the girl who had absolutely no plans to give it up until she met Mr Right, which may or may not be me. That said, our relationship is now one year old and we're so in love it's borderline disgusting. We've lowkey been discussing marriage, which she seems keen on, but I've made it clear I'm not on that level yet.  Recently though my gf and I have been living under the same roof. A first for us. She's staying with me while my roommate is out of town. We haven't seen much of each other because of the pandemic, so needless to say we were excited to spend time together. We would kiss and cuddle, even sleep in the same bed, but she never allowed anything beyond that. Whenever my hands gravitated towards her boobs or butt, she would become flustered and pull away. In those moments, my boner would visibly throb inside my pants and I could tell by the sneaky glances she liked it. As the days went by, she seemed to be doing everything in her power to trigger more boners. Changing clothes in front of me. Begging me to piggyback her to and from the shower while she's wearing nothing but a towel. Moaning whenever we made out. All stuff she's never done with me before. Worst of all was when she prayed at night. Hearing her pray was nothing new, but hearing her go into detail about her ""lustful thoughts"" was not only new, it was fucking hot. Pardon the pun but it became really hard for me not to get turned on. Last night was no different. She was on her knees praying while I was laying in bed with another boner. As soon as she prayed about wanting to taste my cum, I got out of bed and took my raging boner to the bathroom, where I furiously masturbated. When I returned to the bedroom, my gf laughed and asked what happened to my hard-on. I wasn't laughing though. Call it post-nut clarity or whatever, but I told her that I feel like she's going out of her way to turn me on and it's unfair because it makes me wanna fuck and we can't. She shrugged and told me the only thing stopping us from fucking all day every day was a ring on her finger. If that wasn't savage enough, she got completely naked and climbed into bed, you know, because she randomly felt like sleeping in the nude. I told her I wasn't gonna play this game anymore and spent the night on the couch.  We have one more week left in the apartment before my roommate comes back, would it be a dick move to ask my gf to leave sooner because I think she's being too sexy?  Just because I'm the one having a hard time managing my sexual urges, does it give me the right to be upset at my gf for it? **Update** My gf and I talked. She understood where I was coming from and apologized for creating such a sexually charged environment without the satisfaction, so to speak. In addition, she said that when I invited her to the apartment for some alone time, she felt like I was expecting something sexual, which is why she started behaving the way she did. It was her way of putting on a show for me. She admitted that none of her attempts to seduce me went as planned because she realized she had no idea what she was doing or how to finish what she started. According to her, whenever she noticed me getting turned on she would panic and kind of just leave me to deal with the boners. The moment I mentioned her feelings towards marriage vs my feelings, she cried. I still wanted to comfort her but she got too upset and told me she's going home. That was kind of where our conversation ended. It didn't matter what I said, she was done talking. She's been gone for an hour and she's not responded to any of my calls or messages. I'm alone in the apartment now. Not sure what to make of this night.","Discussion here was quite good.

kw7aog,"Me (F 16) and my boyfriend (M 16) have been dating for about a year now and we are starting to do sexual stuff. (I'm on birth control, don't worry).

(the education system failed me.... help please) edit: thanks for the help and the awards guys lmao","Hey OP, so I’m on the pill, and my bf and I have been together for some time/trust one another.... we had that std talk before engaging in any sexual activity (I initiated that talk, and find I have had to be the one to do so with most of my sexual partners in the past). So yes, the cum comes back out, however in my experience it can take a couple of hours, or even into the next morning (I do go to the bathroom after sex with my bf, and we have sex before going to bed). The awkward part (for me) is when the cum has not come back out, and I cough/sneeze/laugh, and feel it...Um forcefully make its way out. Just beware of that. And please be careful about “manually” trying to remove it. Vaginas and their ability to self-clean are something to be admired and respected. Don’t hurt yourself, or throw off your natural flora/pH by sticking anything up there to clean it. Be safe and have fun!  Edit: grammar Edit #2: clarification- based on a few people’s comments about the importance of peeing after sex: this is SO important! I had a UTI once, and I’ll never forget that pain. ...What I meant when I said I go to the bathroom after I have sex is just this- I go pee. If I can’t pee, then I just drink a decent amount of water (hello, rehydration after this kind of workout!) and don’t hold it when I need to go next.",3866
kx3m7c,"[Original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/kvpueh/i_22m_think_my_religious_gf_25_is_sexually) So my gf is no longer staying with me. She believed it was best if we didn't share the same bed, let alone the same apartment, because if the past few days taught her anything, it's that we're not mature enough for that step yet. The two of us met up and had a long discussion about relationships, religion, commitment, and sex. Thanks to the knowledge y'all provided in my original post, I was better prepared to express my feelings without coming across too horny or too hurtful. She was also doing great. Still got heated though. Especially with the two M words. Marriage and manipulation. She denied that she was using sex to get me to go on one knee, which I ended up believing. Call me an idiot but the way she was talking didn't sound like someone who would use me like that. To me she seemed sincere when she said her sexual gestures was nothing more than a reaction to me inviting her to the apartment. According to her, my invitation made her feel pressured to be sexy because having the place to ourselves implied that a certain level of intimacy was expected. She actually confirmed what some of you mentioned in my original post. It was a big turn on for her realizing just what a turn on she was for me. In a way she became mad with power, hence the erotic prayers and semi naked piggyback rides, amongst other things. She couldn't stop shaming herself for getting carried away with her desires and contradicting her religious rulebook. In response I told her that sexual desire is not something to be ashamed of and she should never feel bad for wanting to receive or provide pleasure. I added that I will always respect her religion, like I respect all religions, but based on what has happened, I do feel like her beliefs are throwing our relationship off balance.  My actual words were ""the love is there, but not the love making"". She didn't like the sound of that but I made it clear that I didn't necessarily mean sex. I added that if she was willing to bend her religious rules just to tease me and be naked around me, which she admitted was hot, she could at least open that door a bit more and allow some touching, stroking, maybe even sucking. I said I would be more than happy to return the favour all day every day. She smiled (for the first time since we started the conversation) and said she's open to experimenting. Ain't gonna lie, my penis practically flexed at that moment lol.  We're still not on the same page regarding marriage. All her siblings had husbands at her age and she feels like it's now her time to follow the ""family tradition"" of marrying their first love. It's pressure on both of us. However, we agreed to just leave the topic of marriage ""open for discussion"" while we work on our relationship. I apologized for misreading her sexual expression as manipulation and she apologized for making me feel blue balled and confused. I'm happy to announce that we kissed and made up. And I got to touch her boobs in the process. Progress!  Time will tell if we're truly meant for each other and if zero sex will be sustainable. But right now I love her enough to figure all that out together. That said, I dedicate this update to the people of this sub who didn't mind taking time out of their lives to send a complete stranger messages of support. Some of those messages were tough to read, but at the end of the day it got me to open up about how I feel, and look now, I'm touching boobs!  Much love.  **TL:DR Gf and I addressed all the challenges in our relationship from religion to marriage to sex and decided to be more sexual without forcing her to choose between faith and fucking.**","Hopefully my comment won't be buried, but have your girlfriend read the book ""Shameless: A Sexual Reformation."" It's written by a female priest in the Lutheran church, Nadia Bolz-Weber. It calls out toxic, ancient ideas sprung from religion that sex is bad/a sin. It's a great read and it might help open up her mind a little bit and make her feel less guilt around sex. Edit to include author of the book",2909

kxwob8,"Not sure if this is the appropriate place for this. If not, I can delete if I can be properly redirected. Anyway, so I had the procedure done. Surreal experience. If you want details, I can provide. But basically, they freeze you, open you up, snip, cauterize, stitch you up. Done in like 15 mins. Not exaggerating, it's a quick procedure. It wasn't that bad. Sore the first couple days, but otherwise good. If kids aren't in your future anymore, makes for great safe sex with your partner without risk of pregnancy. You have to do a follow up appointment to make sure there are no sperm left in your emissions but that's a formality.  {EDIT}  Based on some comments, which I agree with. It is wrong with me to say this is a ""formality"". It's very important you do a checkup at least 8 weeks after the procedure. You need to know if you have any sperm cells (alive or dead) still in the vas. Some people don't check, there is sperm left, have unprotected sex = baby! So make sure you do that checkup to confirm before moving forward with having unprotected ejaculations in your partner. {/edit} I know a lot of guys are nervous, anxious about this kind of thing, but its not that bad honestly. My pain tolerance is average I suppose, I can get tattoos without flinching if that is comparable. Its a great way as a man to practice part of safe sex procedures without putting everything on the woman to do.

l0zssl,"I love the idea of being dominated...being told what to do and how to by a woman is so aluring to me. But the thing is, I want it to be soft and loving. I'm not really into rough treatment or bdsm (no hate to the community!) My desire is for this woman to look me in the eye, gently touch me as she tells me what to do. Her taking the pro active role and making things happen WHILE being soft and loving is so attractive to me. I have never heard other men express interest in a dom like this, so I thought this could be interesting/helpful for someone who shares my interest.","This is my own post a year or so ago: Ways to SOFTLY fem-Dom someone! I posted this as a comment and it was received well so I thought I would make a thread so people could add their own ideas! What are ways you can softly dominate a man? For those of us interested in power dynamics (especially the woman being in charge) but aren’t interested in a lot of sadomasochism or humiliation.   1. Wear a skirt or dress w no panties. Stop and kiss him. Put your hands on his shoulders to indicate he should stay where he’s standing. Mosey on over to a couch, bed, or chair and be very flirty about it. Sit down, give him a sweet smile and say “can you get on your knees for me?” He’ll either immediately comply or look at you confused. If he’s confused ask him if he wants your attention, he’ll probably say yes. When he’s on his knees do the “come here” motion finger and open your legs at the same time so he can see you aren’t wearing panties. From here he should crawl toward you. Tell him something like “You’re not getting anything until you make me come.”  2. Pin him down. He’s probably way stronger than you so you aren’t actually pinning him, but a part of the fun is him pretending you are strong enough. It’s dominating but also cute bc it’s silly.  3. Sit on his face and be a little more aggressive w your dirty talk. Instead of “don’t stop, please don’t stop,” say “don’t stop, don’t you FUCKING stop” 4.  Do things as you normally would just be bossy. Don’t pull his shirt off, TELL HIM to take his shirt off. TELL HIM to take your clothes off. TELL HIM to go lay on the bed and wait for you. TELL HIM to change positions.  5. Pull his face deeper when he’s going down on you.  6. Make him beg a little. Next time he tries to go down on you, close your legs and make him say please. Make him tell you he wants it. 7. When your blowing him, if he asks to fuck you look at him like he’s lost his mind and say something like “you’re not in charge here” and go back to blowing him. 8. Blow him and make him keep his hands behind his head. If he moves his hands stop blowing him.  9. Give him a lap dance but tell him absolutely no touching or it stops.  10. When your away from each other during the day, text him the things you want him to do to you later.",989
l1rjo3,"hey guys! i’m not sure how helpful this post will be because every vagina’s different, but i’ve struggled for years to cum at the hands (or mouth) of anyone but myself and IT FINALLY HAPPENED so i figured i’d share tips.  1. Take the pressure off of her! when my boyfriend first started trying to make me cum 7 months ago, he was so sure that it would happen that i felt a lot of pressure and it gave me a lot of anxiety every time we tried. he kept saying things like “It’s going to happen this time” and “I won’t stop until you cum this time” - and while the determination and optimism is MUCH appreciated, it ultimately created even more pressure for me. At about the ten minute mark each time, I would get really self-conscious that I hadn’t cum and that he was bored. By the 20 minute mark when he insisted he wanted to keep trying, I promise you I was not thinking about sex AT ALL lmao. I was stuck in my own head screaming “WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU”, “HE’S TRYING SO HARD”, “JUST CUM ALREADY” and any of the pleasure I was feeling was buried. Seriously guys, I almost faked it once (a big deal for him) just because I felt SO bad and he was working so hard for it that I wanted to give it to him just because he deserved it. After I told him about how much pressure I felt to cum, we started trying just for 10-15 minutes and then moving onto sex if it still wasn’t building for me. This helped me just focus on the pleasure I felt and not worry about needing to cum from it! Once we established that norm, I started getting a lot more into it and I came pretty soon after that.  2. Don’t take it personally, and put. in. the. work. My boyfriend got really insecure that he couldn’t make me cum after months and months of trying, and I felt like he stopped trying for a while simply because he was embarrassed. DONT DO THAT! It’s not a you problem. Like I talked about above, I was equally as embarrassed as he was and the more I felt like he didn’t want to try, the more ashamed I was. YOU’RE DOING GREAT! It takes a lot of work to get there, but (for me at least) as soon as my boyfriend made me cum once it got a whole lot easier. He’s made me cum by himself almost every time since then!! 3. Dirty talk. My boyfriend will dirty talk in my ear almost the entire time, which helps give me a narrative to focus on and makes me feel like he’s into it and not just sitting there bored listening to me pant.  lol. He starts off with fantasies of mine first, and by the time I get really close he’ll start whispering all the things he’s going to do to me after I cum for him. Yeah, that helps lol.  4. Let her guide you (and watch her make herself cum so you get an idea of her technique). For me personally, my clit is too sensitive to directly touch. I had to guide my boyfriend to a very specific spot right above my clit, and then occasionally adjust his finger once it started slipping from that spot. I also had to tell him to speed up/slow down and use less/more pressure. Don’t be embarrassed by her critiques! I swear it is just as difficult when I do it myself, I just can immediately sense when I’m losing the “spot” and adjust myself accordingly. With my boyfriend, I had to tell him all of these adjustments - and some days there were many of them because that spot is so elusive.  5. Multitask, if you can. My boyfriend will sometimes kiss me sloppily, choke me, dig his fingers into my back, or kiss all over my neck or my thighs while he’s working his fingers over my clit. That is ~heavenly~. He also started slipping his fingers inside of me as he played with my clit - sometimes pushing them deep into my G-spot, and sometimes gently teasing the outer entrance until I’m basically begging for him to shove his fingers inside of me. Sometimes he’ll even tease my asshole and slip a finger in there, which really gets me going. Obviously, this is up to personal preference - for a while it was really hard for me to focus on two different sensations at once (penetration and clit stimulation), so that didn’t work for me. Now it turns me on like nothing else!! 6. Try having her stimulate you at the same time! This doesn’t always work for me because it’s hard for me to focus on two things at once when I’m close to cumming, but it’s a MAJOR turn on for me when I can make my boyfriend moan as he’s trying to get me off. I LOVEEE 69-ing because I get to take his cock down my throat as his tongue is doing crazy things to my pussy. If he’s just using his fingers, then I love using lube/spit to give him a handjob as he works his fingers. By the time I’m about to cum, the handjob is definitely sloppy at best - but there’s just something about having his dick in my hand and making him shudder every so often when I brush the head. 7. Try letting her do the work the first couple times. The very first time I came from my boyfriend, I started grinding down on his finger in time with his motions. Pretty soon he was only minimally moving his finger and I was doing some serious hip action to recreate the way I masturbate by myself. So, for example, I would grind my hips in a circular motion with barely any pressure, and then when I got closer I would start jerking my hips up and down while grinding hard into his finger. This is pretty much my technique by myself, but usually my hips are still and my finger is doing the work. This time I flipped it and used his finger! I will say I was really self conscious about this technique at first because I thought it must look like I was having a seizure with all my hip-jerking lol. But pretty soon I stopped caring about what I looked like, and I came like 5 minutes after that lol. I’ve had to use this technique less and less because my boyfriend is learning my exact style, and the work is slowly transferring from my hips back to his fingers. Last time he made me cum in under 10 minutes with pretty much no effort from myself! WILD I hope this helps at least one person!! I seriously was so depressed over this issue, but as soon as it happened once he started being able to make me cum almost every single time by himself. The first time I came, we both sat up and basically screamed with joy lol... we didn’t even have sex after because we were too busy celebrating. Hope you have similar luck with some of these tips, because cumming in the arms of your partner is an AMAZING feeling that I hope all of your girlfriends/fuck buddies/hookups/one-night-stands experience :) edit: added “and/fuck buddies/hookups/one-night-stands” because everyone deserves to cum ;)","While PSA-type posts are usually disfavored here (see the Forum Rules and Posting Guidelines) — this very thorough post on a frequently-discussed topic merits a **one-time** exception to that policy, for now.",584

In my experience, either men have gone down on me our first time hooking up and that’s been consistent throughout our whole relationship and there are men who never go down the entirety of the relationship.

What are your thoughts or experiences with this?",I would think you are right. I was willing to go down on her on the second date. But it could just take some guys some time to do so.

l4v1q2,"My best friend shares *every* detail of her sex life with me. I enjoy the intimacy, and it would be a lie to say that it doesn't turn me on a bit.

Don't feel bad for not getting anywhere with the apps.  Its a particular skill that isn't transferrable to real interactions and made me feel like I was trying to deceive or change myself to appear... idk fuckable?  My advice is to try not talking about sex as much with your friend, bring up how it makes you feel and put a morotorium on it.  It may suck now, but in the long run you might feel better.  In the mean time, excercise, work on yourself and invest in things you enjoy, and keep on moving forward.",3298
l6r5a6," I went to see my boyfriend earlier this evening and he said he had a surprise for me. That I would either hate it or enjoy it. After some fore play, I end up on my stomach. He grabs something and I become very confused as he’s putting something in between my ass and between my inner thighs, pretty close to my pussy. Next thing I know, I feel a tickle... then a tingle, then I’m shaking and spasming.  Well, after having one of the best orgasms of my life, he tells me it’s called a TENS machine. That physical therapists use it to stimulate muscles. Then he starts using it on me a while later, my back, my legs... once he hit lower back, I started to get wet. Then back to between my ass and inner thighs. Never have I gotten wet that much, that easily. I was moaning and gripping the sheets just from the electric shocks. In actual pleasure.  Is this something that other people have experienced? Is this an actual kink? If so, what’s it called? Any recommendations for how to improve it (even though it’s amazing as it is)? I’m in utter shock (hehe pun intended) at this experience. EDIT: a few things here to be added. One, my boyfriend and I have the kind of relationship in which it’s okay for him to surprise me with things like this. He is very cautious and checks in on me when it comes to trying anything new. Two, as far as safety goes, he is probably the most knowledgeable person I know. He is a first responder and is trained in all kinds of things. Three, if anyone has questions about the machine I used specifically, I’d be more than happy to send it to you. As far as the settings on it go, he was controlling it, not me, I have absolutely no clue.","TENS unit is definitely intense depending on where you use it!

ldxqka,"I (20F) got out of a relationship a few months ago and decided to take some time to explore myself, have a few casual hookups, figure out what I like. I have an IUD, get tested monthly and always use condoms, so it’s not like I’m careless or anything. That being said, I’ve had sex with a handful of guys and girls and have two FWBs at the moment. I’m always upfront about my current state and honestly have been really enjoying myself. I never thought I could feel respected and valued by people who don’t want anything serious from me and I’m learning a lot about my tastes, my boundaries and how to communicate them to others.  My issue stems from the fact that I feel like I don’t have anyone to talk about my experiences with. Most of my girl friends are in relationships and/or are quite reserved. Those of my girl friends who are coupled up have told me I’m being careless and seeking out validation from others (which I feel is really easy to say when you’re in a healthy relationship). I have one really close girl friend who happens to be single, and she has talked to me about sex before, but when I opened up to her about how I’ve recently discovered I like some “out of the box” things like being tied up and face fucked, she seemed really uncomfortable and freaked out.  My friends have made jokes about me being ‘easy’ and I laugh it off because I know they’re just jokes but it makes me feel really gross and just generally terrible about myself. I’ve thought about talking to my guy friends, but after one of them told me he jacked off to a picture of me I cannot get it out of my head that they will take such conversations the wrong way and see them as an invitation to have sex with me.

So the big day came and A started undressing me in the bedroom and we started deep tounging while my bf went down on me and I felt so fucking horny lol  After that A and my bf started kissing while he undressed her and I swear his hands didn’t leave her breast one time after they got out of the dress it was like he had never seen breast before, A starts to give him a blowjob and I find myself awkwardly staring so I start playing with myself feeling a bit uncomfortable, bf finally lets go of A breast and gets a condom and slides in me while A sits on my face with her body turned towards my bf and starts riding my face, I feel horny again until my bf pulls out and A gets up.  Yes he got a new condom and A got on top of him riding him like a fucking pornstar and moaning and telling my bf how great his Dick is, bf noticed me and pulls me closer so I start kissing A while she rides him and everything is going well until I hear my bf say he never seen such perfect breast before in his life and that he missed out on a lot and then he starts to moan (he almost never moans with me) and he cums in A after only 3 minuts (he can’t never finish inside me so ofcourse I’m feeling devastated and horrible) A was giving me a side eye and I think my bf realized what he said, it got pretty awkward while I tried my best hiding my tears.  After A left he tried talking about it but I said I have to pick something up from haileys ( my friend) house and left. I cried so hard in my car and I felt so ugly and not enough.  After that I’ve been avoiding him pretty much, he said he is sorry and that he didn’t mean it that it was in the moment of hot sex with A.  He blocked her number but I didn’t even asked to.  We had sex like 2 times in two months and both times I had a shirt on. I’m thinking about breaking up with him, yes I love him but my self esteem is pretty much gone with the wind.  ________update:  Hey first off all thanks for all the support and advice in the comments. I appreciate it. Also I made the post in the middle of the night when I couldn’t sleep and had to get it off me, so I wrote it fast with sleepy eyes lol.  To answer some questions and more background info; yea I do regret having a threesome with him and his coworker and I had my doubts about it but it doesn’t change a damn thing because it happened and it keeps replaying over and over in my head.  No I don’t blame him or A, I blame myself.  Yea I already had a ton of insecurities about myself before this.  I knew deep inside I wasn’t ready for a 3some but I still did it.  Yes I felt left out in the act sometimes but I didn’t want to come off as insecure or annoying so I let them be.  We had a pretty good relationship before this.  I know him blocking her won’t change a thing lol since they will see each other at work after the lockdown if they aren’t already behind my back I wouldn’t be surprised if they were.  We been together for 4 years and before I moved in with him 5 months ago we were long distance mostly seeing each other in weekends  It’s not even about that he liked banging A and her huge tits because I really don’t care about that it’s the missing out part for me and the way he lied to me about not finishing inside me and not being a boob man, he told me he always had trouble cumming with past relationships and it wasn’t because of me (clearly not the case with A)  I’ve never been good with conflict or expressing myself to people even in my close circle, how I feel and I’m not thinking about going (back) to therapy that shit just wasn’t for me I guess. (Had therapy when I was in my late teens to cope with some stuff and my anxiety but I stopped going and when I turned 22 I tried it again with no succes) found out trough therapy I have DA attachment style Side note: I never ended a relationship in my entire life (friends, coworkers, family  ect) I just always leave without saying anything and they never hear from me again, I know it’s fucked up but it works for me.  I know avoiding him won’t help and I prolly pushed him farther away but I just don’t know how to deal with this and I kinda hoped he would be the one to call it’s quits. -sorry for the long ass post lol","I swear to god, threesomes seem destined to ruin healthy relationships.",5115
lels66,"I’ve been with my wife for 10 years 4 married and we have a 14 month old daughter together. Our sex life dwindled after the birth and it’s been gradually increasing back to normal. We’re at the point where we are sneaking in as many quickies as we can while caring for our baby and working. My wife had a massive disrespect and degrading kink. Like it’s something we indulged in a lot. We kinda took a break from this, after the baby for no particular reason and she asked me to do it for her recently. It was something I had no problem doing for her.  While we were making love I said something pretty basic to her. I whispered in her ear very gently, “You’ve been thinking about this all day, weren’t you you dirty wh*r**.” I immediately lost my erection. Like i disgusted myself and the night came to a screeching halt. She said she liked what I said and asked what was wrong. I got kinda embarrassed and said I just tired and was a little out of it. It’s been hard to put into words but after doing some thinking, this is how I think I feel. It’s a little sappy so I’m sorry for anyone that has to read this. Since my wife how our baby it’s hard for me to view her as anything other than, pretty much a living goddess. She grew a life in her body then brought that life into this world. She gave me the gift of my daughter at the expense of her body. I feel like I can never ask her for another favor again. I also feel like my new purpose in life is to protect her and my daughter and make sure they are both happy and safe. These aren’t even conscious feelings it feels very primal and instinctual. I still want to be able to fulfill my wife’s fantasies but it just feels wrong to talk to her that way. Is there a way I can get over this uncomfortableness again?","Tell her! Tell her how it makes you feel, and that you want to be able to do that for her but you aren’t there yet. Communicate about it and see how you can take it slow to get there",2649
lfjdcf,"As in, not ready for sex. As in, it would be as ridiculous to try to have sex with an unprepared vagina as it is to try to have sex with a flaccid penis. Have you ever tried to have PIV or anal sex with a flaccid penis? It just doesnt work. Now, not always. Many people with vaginas sometimes have a disconnect with their minds (me being one of them), where their mind is ready but for whatever reason, their vagina is not wet/prepared for sex. In that case, the other person needs to clarify if theyre ready or ask what they need to get ready.  If theyre ready but their body isnt following, load up on the lube and follow their lead. If theyre not ready, this offers a safe place to explain their needs and wants to enjoy sex. A vagina is not a hole that can be used at any time no matter the condition, just like how a penis is not a rod that can be used at any time no matter the condition. Barring a medical condition or another reason the person’s vagina is usually not wet, PIV should not occur until the vagina is wet/prepared or until the other person directly asks if theyre ready; and if not, what they need to get ready. I’ve experienced a lot of sex when i was dry/unprepared. Its not fun. I started to avoid sex because it often hurt or felt like an annoying chore i had to suffer through, which hurt my bf and our relationship. I had to learn to demand what i needed for my pleasure and not just his, and he had to learn to listen to me. (By demand, i dont mean “we do everything my way and focus entirely on me or no sex”, i mean “i need you/us to do certain things for sex to be equally enjoyable, not just what you need to get your nut. My nut matters too.”)","While most PSA- or essay-type posts get removed from the main r/sex forum (following **Posting Guideline #10**), this post on a rarely-discussed topic merits a one-time exception to that rule.

lg6zcu,"Growing up I won’t lie and had a pretty hard childhood. I was raised in a rather religious household but we weren’t die hard fanatics or anything like that. We still watched raunchy comedies on tv, cursed etc if you get the point.  My mom and dad were great people and I still have amazing relationships with them to this day (they’re still married) but I can’t help but wonder if I missed out on a big part of my life because of their lack of teaching me how to grow up. They not once ever talked to me about women, relationships or sex. They taught us the very basics of sex Ed in school but that’s about it.  I’ll be turning 30 this year and have honestly never been in a real relationship. Not to say I haven’t had a few hookups here and there but my real goal is just finally meet someone who understands me and enjoy life together. I especially have this silly dream of being a dad and I fear every year I get older in the dating pool it will never happen.  My life otherwise feels just great. I’m physically fit and attractive, work out daily, have a stable job, my own place and a butt load of hobbies and interests. I am on the shorter side of things for a guy at 5’8 but it has never seemed to bother me.  I feel like I completely wasted my teen years and most of twenties being extremely shy and introverted and not knowing how to talk to women or date; I had to figure everything out on my own and didn’t even lose my virginity until I was 26. I was considered that ‘weird’ kid in school and didn’t really have any friends outside the other nerdy outcasts.  Now that I have my life figured out I feel like it’s too late. So many women expect guys to have so much more experience than I do at this point and honestly I don’t have any at all when it comes to relationships. I know how to act and be a kind person but is that enough?  Worst of all now that I’m actually ready to meet someone the Pandemic hits and now Incant even see peoples faces because of masks let alone meet in person. Dating apps have been a complete waste of time.  Anyone care to offer advice or share their own experience?   - - - - **EDIT - Seems like half the comments in here think I’m crazy for blaming my parents for why I’m single (I’m not) while the other half sympathize with how hard it was for them to learn about relationships and sex as well.** **For reiteration I’m not blaming my parents for anything. I’m simply suggesting that kids figuring stuff out own their own probably isn’t the best way to go about things especially in today’s age. This could just be me but I certainly wouldn’t want my kid growing up discovering porn and thinking sex is just the man sticking it in and smacking the woman’s ass a bunch of times and calling it good sex.

lgrdjz,"Yesterday my gf (17) and I were looking forward to hanging out at my house. She's my first gf and it's been a challenge for my mom to get used to the idea that I'm now spending time with someone who kisses and touches me. My mom got so worked up, she removed the lock mechanism on my door and made me promise to keep my room wide open whenever I had company. I'm not proud of my reaction but my mom literally making my room unlockable pushed all the wrong buttons. She made me feel like shit and I wanted to return the favour.  So I made it clear to my mom that A) I'm no longer a virgin and B) I'm not gonna stop having sex just because she was taking away my privacy. My mom got really upset and basically called my gf a slut, because in her mind, girls my age just wanted boys and babies. I was forced to talk over my mom because she went on an infinite rant about pregnancy, premarital sex, etc. I told her that we always used protection and that my gf was actually the one who encouraged me to take my time and not rush into having sex, but at the end of the day it was me who wanted to be more intimate. In the heat of the moment angry me had no problem telling my mom if anyone was a so called slut, it was me, because I allowed my gf to bend me over and spank me until I'm sore. If you're cringing right about now, imagine how I'm feeling.  Needless to say my gf didn't come over, not only because of my mother but also because of me. She said my mom overreacted and I just added fuel to the fire. So now I'm in the dog box with both of them. Please tell me sex is not supposed to be this complicated at my age.","Waaayy more complicated at 17 than later down the line.  I have a house and a husband and nobody cares what we do.

ljteqw,"I keep seeing posts and comments about dudes who are super insecure about their partners owning dildos. Particularly if that dildo is bigger or girthier than they are. I wrote this as a comment on another post, but thought I should post it here, because guys, you're selling yourself short. Sexually, you are so much more than a rubber schlong.   See, dudes keep getting it backwards. When people say size doesn't matter, it's true, cuz you can buy her that 3 foot dildo. Dildo's are literally the reason you don't have to worry about your own endowment. Provide a body, brain, fingers, tongue, and use the dildo too.  Dudes who depend on only their dicks to get a woman off are likely not getting any women off.  Believe me, I've been with my fair share of them. It's about time we started thinking of dicks the same way we do clits. Its there for your own enjoyment. Thinking of it as a tool for your partner's enjoyment (and it sometimes works like that) is just gonna make you super insecure about whether it can do ""it's job"".  Your dick's job is to give \*you\* pleasure. \*Your\* job is to give your \*partner\* pleasure, and receive pleasure from your partner. Does that help?

lkijlt,"I started dating my boyfriend and at first he didn’t really seem to understand how to get me off and what techniques worked. He didn’t really seem focused on having me orgasm every time. Sex still felt really special, but he seemed confused about how to get a woman to cum. It made sex uncomfortable because he would want it all the time but it wasn’t as good for me because I didn’t climax. I ended up wanting it less and not really excited about it.  Then I decided to tell him that we both need to orgasm each time, or at least put in a good effort to accomplish that goal. I made it pretty clear that I wanted him to make sure I had an orgasm and that I wanted an orgasm each time we had sex. I also subtly showed him an article on female orgasms and he took it to heart. Slowly he started to learn great techniques. Now I’m having mindblowing body numbing orgasms from what he’s changed. Here’s some tips! 1. When in missionary he will rub his pelvis in a back and forth motion on my clitoris. And will make sure to hit my clitoris with his pelvis when he is thrusting inside of me.  2. He hits the back end of my vagina when he thrusts into me and goes as deep as he can. Then when he is really deep, I thrust into his cock in the position that feels best. Then when I find a good spot I start thrusting on him while he’s still deep inside of me and he’s stationary. Once he gets a feel for what I’m needing, he starts thrusting to hit the same spots. It works very well. Usually it’s a lot of back and forth like this between us where he lets me guide him on where the sweet spots are for me.  3. Consistency. Once a spot or motion works for me, he will know that doing the same action will get me to orgasm. So he will be consistent until I actually orgasm. He will sometimes take small breaks inside of me where he stays still so that he doesn’t cum, especially when he knows I’m super close. I guide him with positive exclamations when he does something that feels super good.  4. Oral sex. He licks my clit and the entrance to my vagina. Consistency is key. I had to really guide him to where my clitoris was and exactly what notions made me feel good. For me I like side to side motion on my clit and to have it be flicked. He will use his nose as well, I get really turned on when he licks my vaginal opening 5. Sometimes I will touch myself when he is pounding me so that he can see the motions I like. So I rub my clit while he is Pounding me to make myself cum. He loves it and I love it.  6. Dirty talk. I love the sweet dirty talk and how he tells me what he likes about me and says things about stretching my right pussy and taking his cock. I like it when he whispers them lightly into my ear  Hope these help someone. There’s always hope. I had to get confidence to guide him and he had to have enough confidence to be excited for me to show him, it’s very fun. I have multiple orgasms all the time and it’s so fun!!  EDIT: thank you for all the upvotes and the awards! It is very humbling and gave my partner a big boost of confidence! I have had a few questions thrown my way and I’ll put down a few of the answers here from the popular ones -the article I found really helpful is from betches from a fab author. She empathized the major importance of once you hit the right spot for a woman and right movement, consistency is super important. This actually helped me realize what I needed in sex too:  https://betches.com/top-3-oral-sex-tips-from-a-gay-woman/ -apparently a lot of you are curious about penis size as well....I am reluctant to answer this question because I really think that is the least important aspect of our sex and what’s *most* important is our connection and desire to please eachother. I also don’t know his exact size, but I know he’s within the average.  -and to all the women asking how to bring this up to their partners? Do it! I have had so many men thanking me for posting this and I think that a lot of guys reallllllllly want to please their partners and it’s the sweetest thing ever. I think communication is really important, maybe share the article to get a conversation going on how to have more orgasms. It should be fun to try to figure it out together! The sooner is probably better, because then you have more time for good sex -my partner wanted to me to add one thing to this about another technique. He will go down on me until I come, I will stroke him while he’s going down on me to keep him hard and then immediately when I orgasm we will have sex so that he can feel my orgasm. And it sets off a cascade because he will get super hard which is hot to me he finds it so hot and then he gets even more turned on when I’m so turned on.","This topic is discussed here pretty frequently.

It's kind of complicated because I take medication that can cause sexual dysfunction and sometimes I can't get off no matter how bad I want to.  &#x200B; Anyway, I didn't want her to get tired because I've heard blowing dudes can become uncomfortable for the woman (mouth getting tired and whatnot) so I gently told her ""Don't worry, it's just a medication thing.

Boom. Fireworks. It made me feel so good to know that she was actually still into it and that she was doing it because she loved me and wanted me to be satisfied.

We were friends before we got together and I knew he's had many girlfriends in the past, both casual and serious, but I never paid that much thought. We were talking about pegging the other day just academically, since it's not really my thing, but he told me that if I ever get curious, we can try it. His willingness and the way he said it got me curious, so I asked him if it's something he wants to do or if it's something he's done before. He told me that yes, he had done it and enjoyed it, but he doesn't really want to do it with me cause he knows I probably wouldn't be into it that much.

ltsp7k,"So I’ve (19M) been talking to this girl (19F) for 3 weeks and we finally met up yesterday. At the start it looked like it was going to become a friends with benefits type of relationship, until two days ago she messaged me saying I’ve been thinking about it and I’m not sure I’m ready to get into something sexually with someone again. She broke up with her bf a month ago and said she likes to have an emotional connection in order to have sex.  Anyways yesterday we go out to eat dinner and just continue to talk that evening until we decide to head back to my place to watch this show she wanted me to try out. She insisted before all this (2 days ago when she updated me) that we were still going to cuddle just that no sex was going to happen out of it. I always respect what other people want and my mindset since she updated me was that sex wasn’t going to happen out of this.  Well we are watching the show and cuddling. Then we eventually start kissing and making out. It starts to get a little more heated and she tells me to take out a condom and get into it. But at that moment I pull myself back and look at her. I then tell her “I’m not going to do it, sorry. I don’t want to be put in a situation that you can maybe regret since you were feeling horny.” After this I feel a little awkward and we then switch back to cuddling until she finally leaves to go home.  Was my response to this scenario correct or did I ruin the mojo? I was fully into the moment and would of loved to do it. But something in my head had a feeling that her judgment was being clouded due to her being horny. But now I’m not sure if I messed up. She hasn’t said anything about it to me yet, like thank you for not going forward with it or vice versa. And now I’m lost...","You definitely chose the safer route- she'd stated a boundary, and then changed it, and you didn't cross the boundary without having a discussion in a less-heated moment.  How is she reacting? People have all kinds of stories about sex and what it means to do or not do a thing, and her story could be anywhere from ""OP really respects me and wants me to feel good and safe with him"" to ""op must think I'm defective or not hot"", or any of a thousand other possibilities. She may or may not even be consciously aware of that story, but she's responding to it regardless.

Either way, I'm now ready to go looking for something more serious (when the pandemic ends), and I do think I have to clearly Say from the beginning what I want to not waste anyone's time. For my parents though, my lack of success comes from one mistake: I slept with them on the first date. My mom says guys like the chase, that I have to make them wait to let them craving for more, to string them along until they have some feelings for me and FINALLY offer my body. My dad says if it's too ""easy"", guys lose interest. My sister even add that she asked the opinion of her BF's friends, and they all agreed to it. Overall, the main argument is that if I'm ""easy"", I'm not girlfriend material, and pretty much a slut. And it ENRAGES me. I am a critical-thinking, responsible, mature sexual adult that knows what she wants and understand that physical connection doesn't undermine emotional connection. And you know what? Those are my basic standards for a future partner. If a guy that I like fucking decides to judge me unworthy of him because we BOTH CONSENSUALLY had sex on the first date, he's an immature boy with backward thinking that I don't want in my life. Now, I'm not judging people who prefer to wait, boys or girls, for any reason. But this can be communicated between both parties with respect, and can be explained if one of them is interested in sex on the first date. It can even be a no-no for someone, if they can't imagine themselves with someone who doesn't have a more, how to say, ""private"" sex life. But those people WON'T have sex with their date, and WON'T judge them for what they did themselves. Maybe I'll wait next time I meet someone I like. Maybe I won't. But if we're both into it, I will certainly not restrain myself in the fear he will judge me, deem me too easy, or try to string him along with the promise of something to keep him. So I told my parents that, and that maybe in the 70s when they were dating people it was like that, but we are in a more open-minded world now. And I told my sister that I wouldn't date any of her BF's friends. EDIT: Thanks for this LOAD of responses! I really had interesting conversations here, and I want to add that I don't judge any person that prefers to wait before engaging in any sexual activities, and are searching for the same type of person. It's important to share the same values on sex with your potential partner, and it's important to respect those values. Either way, I also had other *interesting* conversations. Here are some of the wonderful arguments I met who are against having sex on the first date: - Men are biologically less attracted to ''promiscuous'' women - Women who are more promiscuous are more likely to cheat - Men are ''physically driven'', and having sex on the first date will mess with that - Guys indeed like the chase, they are motivated by sex, that's how male brains work and I have to deal with it - There are whores and wives, both have value but you will get judged if you have a whore - Most men will not feel comfortable with my promiscuous sexual past, while admitting they have their own promiscuous past - If you put out fast, it means you fucked with many guys, and it's a turn off for a guy because there are then ''competitors'' - It doesn't inspire confidence in men because of my impulsivity and my lack of responsibility over getting pregnant and STDs - Men are like that. Deal with it. I also met really good comments who explain really why they want to wait, and why they don't judge others who don't. So yeah, there's that. I will then have a dating life where sex shouldn't be a dealbreaker and more an adventure to discover together, and put my boundaries about a serious relationship through communication :).","I've never decided to ghost a girl because we fucked on the first date, nor seen one as ""easy."" If a fish jumped on your hook you're not going to tell anyone it was an easy catch, you're going to assume you're a shit-hot fisherman with a mighty fine rod! I ended up in a 3 year thing from a girl I slept with first date, so there's that. I could imagine sleeping with someone and thinking during the act that they might end up being a one off, but that doesn't mean they'd have gotten a second date had we not fucked, if that makes sense? I'm sure girls have thought the same towards me (righto Mr, but I'm gone tomorrow). What will I tell my own daughters? Probably just stay safe and enjoy life, and ask r/sex instead of their olds for advice. I don't think they'll need a set of 70s societal standards to find love in the 2030s and 2040s!",2412
lxvhd1,"Original Post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/lwg1x6/how_do_i_28f_make_my_husband_30m_want_me_sexually/) *First of all a huge THANK you for everyone who has helped me in my situation. Your advices have helped me tremendously.*  So, yesterday morning I've messaged my husband that we need to talk, and we agreed that a talk is a must in our current situation. We cancelled our evening walk, prepared some wine and we talked. We talked for hours and hours, tears were shed heavily. Also, there was yelling (not abusive yelling just yelling). I've come to know that for the past two months my husband had been in therapy himself. He didn't want to bother me with this. He was suffering so much in the past year. My actions caused him to feel unwanted, undesired, and unloved. He felt useless as a man. He started to resent me, and when it came to this point he went to therapy cause according to him he couldn't fathom the idea of resenting me as he loves me so much. It was going well, and masturbation was something his therapist recommended to do to relieve pressure and help him maintain a healthy life. The reason he told me those hurtful things when I walked on him that day was me saying ""I have needs too"". He felt so angry at the moment that he told me these awful words, He thought well, if you have needs why the hell aren't you telling me something or saying anything. And in his mind he thought I was cheating on him, since according to him I didn't want him sexually anymore.  I didn't know how deep I hurt that man. My heart was bleeding as I was listening to him. I told him how fucked up I was in my head. How I've come to realize how awful of a wife I was to him, and that I'm now willing to change myself to be a better person for himself and myself as well.  He was very skeptical, and I mean extremely skeptical, which I totally understand and don't blame him at all for that. Since my record of ""brushing things off"". I showed him my next therapy appointment, and also some of the advices I've received her I wrote it down in my notepad, so I showed him those as well.  He apologized to me, and I apologized to him. We acknowledged that we both messed up here, and we spend a lot of time pointing out where did we mess up. And we acknowledge every bad thing we both did in regards to our feelings. We spent the whole night talking about this.  We came to agree that we want our marriage to work again, but he made it clear that if I bailed out on therapy, or ""brushed"" therapy off. Then the marriage is Over. And I agreed on that cause this is what I want as well.  Today morning, we wake up I met him at the kitchen, and he KISSED me good morning. I kissed him back and we had breakfast. After breakfast I thought to try something, and I went to him and started to make out with him, I was missing him so much and as it turned out he was missing me as much well. And for the first time in so long I saw him leaving smiling. I've been crying since the morning, and I can't describe you how happy I am now.  Once more thanks a lot for all the advice you've provided me, and thanks to all of you I've looked deeply into my actions and made some decisions to change myself to the better including the first step of getting myself into therapy (sex-positive therapist)","Your original post hit very close to home for me, but I'm in your husbands situation. I too had a chat with my partner today, and explained a lot to her about why my mood and attention to her had deteriorated over the last few months. Therapy may work for us in the long run, but just getting the feelings out there helped massively, and she took on board what I was saying. There was some making up, but we will see if things have changed in the long term, as time passes, but for now talking about it, rather than hiding it/bottling it up has done us a world of good. Thank you for the inspiration to confront it, rather than my usual tactic of ignoring a problem till it goes away. I'm glad to hear that you two have turned a corner.",1400
ly8f1p,"I deleted my original throwaway account because I didn't think I'd ever use it again. Still the same me though. More or less. My gf and I broke up. As some of you predicted in my [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/kvpueh/i_22m_think_my_religious_gf_25_is_sexually) and [updated](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/kx3m7c/update_i_22m_think_my_religious_gf_25_is_sexually) posts, our relationship was doomed to be disastrous. I did my best to make it work, but towards the end it became painfully obvious we were never gonna be on the same page as bf and gf, let alone husband and wife. All our communication regarding religion, marriage and intimacy did nothing to benefit our relationship or promote healthy physical affection between us. Even though she gave me the green light to touch her more, I was still made to feel like I was pressuring her to have sex every time I happened to kiss her on the neck or squeeze her butt whenever we made out.  It was never my intention to make her feel uncomfortable, hence all our discussions, but it seemed like all I ever did was make her uncomfortable. I didn't even wanna get boners in front of her anymore. Long story short, I decided to grow a pair of balls and put us both out of our misery. Took me long enough but I finally realized it was pointless to prolong a relationship between two people who were no longer making each other happy. The break up was brutal. My poor roommate had to put up with my heartbroken ass for weeks. To this day I'm still embarrassed he saw that side of me, but thanks to him encouraging me to hang out with his friend (19f), I have my first FWB and I'm not a virgin anymore!  No more pressure to get married. No more shame for craving intimacy. The heartache comes and goes when I think about my ex, but I'm not gonna lie, sex is a great distraction. Now I can also ask burning sex questions in this sub and feel like I belong.  TL:DR Lost a gf. Gained a FWB. Lost my virginity. Gained experience.",Yay! I caught an update post before it got deleted by mods! That's the best thing ever on this sub... I live for the updates. Glad you're happier now :),2995
lz336i,"Man I’m not sure if this is weird or not but I have to say there’s something intoxicating about it What’s the science behind this shit? It’s addicting. If her pussy was a cologne, I’d probably wear it.  I’m not trolling either. I almost hate having this kink. I don’t even know if it’s actually a kink or just nature? It feels weird as fuck but I can’t stop and I love it. I love the smell and I wanna smell it every chance I get   I don’t care if it’s swampy and damp or dry and fresh. I love it. I’m even more turned on if she’s wet and I get to smell it.  Y’all I literally always thought dudes that sniffed panties were weirdos until I became that dude.  But there’s nothing like when her legs open up and I get to smell it I like to smell it just as much as I like eating it and idk why  I can definitely come from just smelling her down there  It made her feel weird at first but now she does it. If we’re together and not doing anything she will put her hands between her legs and put it by my nose. Every scent of hers down there is good. The only time it’s sharp is when she’s nearing her period but that’s hormones. I don’t know why I’ve become like this but figured I would write this here Sometimes I only wanna smell her to calm down or feel happy.

m0vxf5,"Hey everyone - I need a space to get this off my chest and I don’t feel comfortable talking about it with friends. A few months back, my barber mentioned how he and his brother went to get a happy ending at a massage place. This spurred my curiosity into the world of massage parlors. So, today, I decided to finally venture off and find one myself. As soon as walked in, I knew explicitly what I was getting myself into. It’d been a few years since my last relationship and covid-related loneliness/horniness really kind of catalyzed me to try. Needless to say - I regret it. It was a nice experience, okay massage and all that. She started off with a blowjob, and then quickly put on a condom. Next thing I know it, full experience and whatnot. After I put on my clothes, I started feeling a lot of regret about what just happened. I don’t know what it was in the moment, but I wish I could’ve stopped myself from walking in. The entire drive home I felt really sad and empty. I don’t know if this it’s cause this is the first time I had emotionless sex or if because my “moral compass” wasn’t as finely tuned as I believed it to be, but I just feel so empty and sad right now. For some background, I’m (24M). Thanks for reading, the thought that someone else is reading this is nice. EDIT/UPDATE: Wow, I can’t believe how big this blew up. I do want to highlight a few things now: - So many of your comments have helped me view this as a learning experience - I, like many others, need to be cognizant of sex trafficking and how it relates to places like this. I’m hoping that this post and the subsequent comments help to highlight that and bring more awareness to it. - This was not for me and I don’t see myself going back ever again. I saw some people in the comments who were also contemplating this same thing - make sure you take my previous point into consideration.","Take it as a lesson learned.  Some people may have no problem with it.  Others like you find the experience to be negative.  Honestly, you are better off knowing that meaningless sex is just that... meaningless, and perhaps now, you know you want and deserve better.",3308
m2v4pw,I'm (31) 5 months pregnant and ever since I entered the second trimester ALL I can think about is sex. This is weird for me because my entire life I have had almost no sex drive (besides the occasional masturbation sesh or having sex with my SO).  I mean ALL I think about is sex. Im constantly horny. I'm always throbbing down there. I look at my SO and just want to fuck the shit out of him. I'm masturbating at least twice a day.  This is absolutely insane. I'm assuming it's the pregnancy hormones but I don't want this to go away after I have the baby!!! Like I want to still enjoy and want sex when I'm not pregnant anymore. It's so amazing. Anyone know how to keep the feeling going after pregnancy???  Bummed because some things I really like are off limits while pregnant (choking) and I want it so bad.  Please help me figure out how I can continue my sex drive when the baby comes.,"It likely won’t continue. That’s just the reality. There is extra blood flow going to your private areas making you feel extra arousal. That blood flow will go back to normal eventually.  I’m pregnant too, four months. I have heard some people here say sex is better post baby though, so you have that going for you.",2025
m6i4gr,"*I posted this in the sexual achievements thread but was encouraged to post my experience in the main forum.* Last week, I matched with a really hot guy on Tinder who sent me the most respectful message asking to give me head. Usually, I'd be turned off by this but I'm moving to another country and was looking for exactly this type of situation to happen. However, I was wondering why such a good-looking guy was immediately offering head. Not that hot guys don't give head, but I found it interesting that he was eager to please. My intuition told me something was there but I didn't look too deep into it. Fast forward to yesterday and I find myself in his city so I hit him up to take him up on his offer and he tells me to come through. I ask him to send me his address. I waited like 15 mins for him to text me and when he did I saw that he sent me a picture of himself... In a wheelchair. He said if I didn't mind that then I should come over. I was cracking up. I KNEW it was something. I had a small reckoning with myself, 1) because he didn't mention this beforehand and 2) I had never hooked up with or dated someone who was disabled. After 20 mins of debating what to do. I decided that even tho he should've mentioned this earlier, I was already there and already planned to hang out whether we did anything or not so why not? Umm it ended up being such a dope night! He is FINE, so kind, so charismatic, and so GOOD at giving head! He ate me out and fingered me for literally 6 hours. His arms are strong AF and I tend to squirm a lot while getting head (like try to fight the guy off lol) but he had me pinned in place, it was so hot. I came multiple times, we slept and cuddled, woke up and did it all over again. I've never had a guy be so focused on my pleasure and so turned on by seeing me enjoy myself. I wish I had met him sooner before I left. All I can say is, while unconventional, that ended up being one of the best hookups I've had.   Moral of the story: Give men and women in wheelchairs (or with any physical disability for that matter) the same chance you would any able-bodied human. ETA: His entire lower half (including le penis) is not functional so no I couldn't reciprocate in that way, but trust that we both equally enjoyed ourselves :)","I’m a paraplegic. Can confirm, I do enjoy wrapping my arms around my wife’s legs when going down on her. With my upper body strength it’s kind of a form of domination. Feels hot and gives me more control. My wife enjoys my arms as well and being able to feel my muscles with her hands as I go down on her.",6333
m7nxpo,"She's a preschool teacher and she seems to really love her job. I appreciate that she enjoys teaching kids, but sometimes she forgets to deactivate her teacher mode when she's with me. Like she's always quick to give me the glasses on the tip of her nose stare down before correcting me on a random word I pronounced wrong or something. It never really bothered me that she was like that. Not until we decided to sleep together.  She knew I was a virgin. I knew she had a high sex drive. We both knew every person on the planet was a potential incubator for Covid, so I guess the idea of us having sex during a time of social separation was kind of inevitable. Two days ago we hooked up. I enjoyed the experience and I thought she did too. Little did I know she made a list of everything I did wrong. She didn't waste any time sending me that list the following morning. This is what I had to read a day after losing my virginity:  1. Thrusting is not just rapid in and out movements like you're impaling my vagina, but also swaying your hips like you're hula hooping in slow mo. 2. If you notice me plucking one of your pubes from my tongue or teeth during a blowjob, just allow it to happen without providing an awkward apology.  3. Follow up to #2: hands off my head when I'm blowing you. 4. No need to say ""I'm in"" when you put your penis inside another person. 5. There's a difference between moaning, which is hot, and humming, which is just weird (dude you're a hummer).  6. Repeatedly asking me if it feels good becomes distracting when it's actually feeling good. 7. Kissing and groping is still possible during penetration otherwise our upper bodies might as well just leave the room. 8. Talking dirty sounds unnatural coming from you, I dunno, it's like hearing your favourite Disney character use the word ""fuck"". 9. I'm not naked for nothing so no need to close your eyes when I'm riding you.  10. Teasing me with your tongue as you made your way towards my vagina was good, until you kind of forgot about my vagina because you were too busy rimming my belly button.  11. Consistency is key during oral, so if I breathe heavier, moan harder or grind all over your face... don't change what you're doing down there otherwise you're never gonna make me cum. 12. Consent is always good but you don't need my permission to switch positions.  13. You have a cum face, you must have, please invent one if you don't, because an expressionless orgasm is unattractive AF.  Based on how I described her personality I probably should've seen this coming. But damn. It was my first time, show some mercy. I'm so nervous to have sex again because I don't want that list to become even longer. Do you think she's nitpicking for the most part or am I just bad at sex?","Locked for further commenting.

m809of,"Original Post: ( [I had an honest conversation with my BF about our sex life and I think it destroyed our relationship. Help! : sex (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/m6tjp8/i_had_an_honest_conversation_with_my_bf_about_our/) ) &#x200B; Thanks a lot for your advices. It really helped me navigate through all the emotions. Today's morning I went to my BF and told him we need to talk. He wanted to postpone as usual but I told him this time NO we need to talk. He works from home these months so our hours are pretty flexible. We sat down and talked about everything. I told him exactly how I feel and that I miss him so much. I then told him how my body is built and how the size of my vaginal canal is out of my hand just like my height or eye colors. I had prepared a list of the most epic times we have had sex before and I started to tell him how epic those nights were. He started to loosen up a little and he even started to engage with me and remind me of nights and recall how we both felt those nights. It took us around an hour of talking and we laughed a lot. I then showed him a website with diagrams of female genitalia and how hey are shaped. I then showed him a diagram of some genitalia that are like me and how those are abnormal and not that common. I then showed him a blog about women who have elongated vaginal canal, and the most common theme of those women talking was how much they enjoy clitoral orgasms and that PIV orgasms are normally not achievable to them with their partners. I then assured him that if he didn't satisfy me sexually I would never been in a relationship with him for 6 years! And he agreed to that and laughed. We spent time talking and he expressed some of his thought process, and some of his insecurities that I never knew about and I countered every insecurity of his with several times he made me orgasm and how he doesn't have to worry about that or this. By the end of our talk his mode has changed so much, it was like watching a baby get from crying to laughing. I was so happy that I cried. We started kissing and making out and it was the first time since two months now. I then gave him a BJ telling him how much I miss him and how much I love his penis. We still didn't have sex, but I'm comfortable with how things are going. I'm starting to get my BF back, and more importantly I see his confidence starting to get back to his eyes. Yes, it's only been a few hours, but I really can see that sparkle starting in his eyes once again. I'd like to thank everyone of you who gave me great advice. I was very lost, and without your advice I don't think I'd be making any progress, and my BF would still be unhappy. So, thank you so much, and yes I know it's a long road ahead still, so wish me luck :) &#x200B; ***Update*** Thank you all for your kind wishes, advices and sweet words.

m8e0e4,"Cutting a lot of the background story short, a good friend of mine who I've known for over 20 years asked me to have sex with his wife whilst he watched. There a British Chinese couple with two kids. I'm single, and he has always known that I find his wife attractive as we both knew her before they were in a relationship. I blew off his request as just a silly idea, but he was quite persistent with the invitation and told me I was the only guy his wife had agreed to have sex with... The more I thought about the situation, the more I liked the idea of getting the chance to fuck his wife, but part of me also realised it was a little wrong. My friend was very enthusiastic about the idea, and guaranteed me it was all just strictly platonic fun and nothing more... A week later, they arranged a babysitter, and came to my flat on a Saturday evening. We went through with the arrangement and my friend watched whilst I went down on his wife, and fucked her. She was very enthusiastic and incredibly wet, but I could also see my friend was watching intently and becoming very agitated. She got on top of me, and started to ride me, clearly enjoying every minute, when my friend shouted at us to stop... He looked very angry and said all he could think of is the fact he was letting another guy fuck his wife and he didn't like it. She quickly got dreseed and they left, and an hour later I got a text message apologising from my friend.... The problem is, that it has definately affected our friendship... My friend has become incredibly 'frosty' towards me and his wife has even emailed me to say that he keeps asking her why she was so enthusiastic, and thinks she enjoyed it a little too much. To make matters worse, his wife has very recently asked me if I would like to meet with her in the daytime as my friend is at work, and the kids gave returned to school.... As much as I like her, I turned down the offer. It's a total mess... I knew it was a bad decision, but now I have a friend who has issues with me, even though he instigated the whole thing... I also now have his wife who is actually willing to cheat on him....","Yeah, this is why one of the golden rules for swingers is ""make friends out of swingers, not swingers out of friends.""

mchap0," I have had countless men tell me “Oh you came, you just didn’t know” because they have stuff on their dick. It’s white and so automatically it has to be female ejaculate right?  No sweetheart. What you’re seeing is actually discharge.  I have recently concluded that not many guys understand what discharge is. So for those who are a bit clueless, here’s a little rundown: •Discharge is a mixture of fluid and cells from the vagina. It is the vagina’s way of cleaning and protecting itself.  •Discharge does increase with sexual arousal (as well as ovulation). Exercise, birth control, and even emotional stress can increase it too.  •Discharge is a normal and healthy thing. Some women produce more than others.  •It can be embarrassing for some women. But it is a natural and healthy thing. It does NOT mean she has an STD or anything is wrong with her. It can be an indicator that something is off but more than likely you wouldn’t be able to tell what’s normal discharge for her.  •A vagina is usually in the pH range of 3.8 and 4.5, which is moderately acidic. Obviously, when you get acidic stuff on your clothes, it can essentially “bleach” them. It’s normal for a woman to have bleach-like stains on her underwear, her vagina is acidic.   As far as sex and discharge goes... as said previously, discharge can increase with sexual arousal. It’s possible for it to get on you. A woman will generally know when she finishes, so please don’t argue that she did cum and didn’t know. What you’re seeing is more than likely discharge. Personally, I don’t cum. So when a guy tells me I did, it’s kind of annoying and/or amusing. A woman knows her body. Discharge is not cum. Make sure before you say she came, you were watching her body language.  EDIT: To help clarify, here are some links that can answer some of the questions I’ve had.  - [FLUID DETECTIVE: CUM OR DISCHARGE?](https://thesexpert.princeton.edu/2019/11/828/)  - [Getting wet: discharge vs. cervical fluid vs. arousal fluid](https://helloclue.com/articles/cycle-a-z/getting-wet-cervical-fluid-vs-arousal-fluid-vs-discharge)  - [Women and Orgasm: Facts About the Female Climax](https://www.everydayhealth.com/sexual-health/the-female-orgasm.aspx)  - [What Happens When A Woman Gets Wet? ](https://www.aoafamily.com/blog/what-happens-when-a-women-gets-wet/)  - [Everything you need to know about orgasms](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/232318#common-misconceptions)  (note that this article will describe a female and male orgasm differently and that a male experiences ejaculation with his orgasm)  - [All About Orgasms: Why We Have Them, Why We Don’t, and How to Increase Pleasure](https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book-excerpts/health-article/all-about-orgasms/)  (“Ejaculation can occur with or without an orgasm”)  -Personal Note:  So, this is based off my own personal experience, as well as what I’ve discussed with a lot of my girl friends. (That being said, not all women are the same, my info may not be true for all) Orgasms can occur with or without cumming/squirting/female ejaculate. Personally, I can orgasm but I do not cum. I can squirt, but it doesn’t happen every time I orgasm. The orgasm itself is defined as “blood flow to the genitals, causing them to be more sensitive... a person’s heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate may increase... the muscles may twitch or spasm. A series of rhythmic contractions occur in the uterus, vagina, and pelvic floor muscles.

mdnlrw,Hi so me(34f) and my bf(35m) have been together for about 2 and a half years...when we first started having sex it was great lots of foreplay and stuff so was very happy. About 12 months into our relationship i would wake up and catch him watching porn beside me or he would ask me to go downstairs to get something for him then he would masturbate to porn...this really upset me i confronted him about it and he said that my vagina had become to loose and wet and no longer felt any pleasure from piv sex. Understandably i was hurt and upset and started to do kegles to tighten things up down there and he promised he would quit the porn. So for past 6 months when he wants sex he thinks he can just stick his penis in without any kind of foreplay at all no kissing no touching nothing he just pumps away for 2 minutes until he cums then rolls over and falls asleep leaving me lying there like a used fleshlight. Has anyone else experienced this? What should i do? I have tried to talk to him hundreds of times but he just gets defensive please help.,Thankyou so much everyone for your words of advice i really do appreciate it....i have just went and asked him if we could have about the issue and try and work through what is going on and he point blank refused and told me the problem is mine so I'm packing his bags as we speak i realised in that moment that no he does not love me at all and that i deserve better...still heartbroken tho,6372
mfwu0a,"I get really uncomfortable when she screams and yells things like ""Aaaaahhh...f@\*k my pu#\*y!"" or ""Oooohhh I'm cumming!"" I personally love it, but not when I know the neighbors can hear (I live in an apartment). I'm also embarrassed that when I see my neighbors it will be akward, and I'll feel really uncomfortable knowing they're basically (in a way) participating in our sex, even though they don't want to be. When I talk to my girl about it, she totally brushes it off and says shit like, ""Who cares?"" or ""They wish they had sex like we do."" I'm not sure how much of an issue to make out of it. &#x200B; Anybody else have this issue?","Well, I've been the audience.  To me, it felt somewhat like being a voyeur, which isn't exactly my thing, so I attempted to drown out the 'noises' by blasting the TV, which turned out not to be loud enough.  Then, in the middle of things, the couple hopped off the bed, ran to the window, and yelled to their friend who'd just exited a cab, ""Hey come on up, we're in the middle of it, and were wondering where you were!""  So, yeah, I got to listen to a loud threesome using their bed as a trampoline, while I watched Turner Classic Movies at top volume.  Specifically, ""Camille"".",4805
mgliwt,"I have been on BC pills for over 15 years. Sex has felt like “something I should do”, my anxiety has been a personality trait, and overall, I felt that I didn’t want to touch my SO since it could trigger sex (I was actually researching asexuality). I went off of BC pills about 2 weeks ago to fix my libido since my therapist had told me about the correlation between low libido and hormonal bc. I had shared how “broken” I felt, and DEAR GOD—the difference. It is like I cannot get ENOUGH of my partner. I feel so clear headed and in general more connected. I feel less triggered by small things, more logical, less anxious, happier, and more confident.  We are currently using condoms only, and while it does feel different than without, the sex is better... and more connected. I researched a ton to see if going off would help my libido since it’s such a pain to go off and back on again, and I just can’t believe the difference. This is just a PSA—if your libido is lower and you feel “broken,” look at your birth control. If you do have a low libido no matter what, no shame! Just wanted to extend my experience here as I can’t believe the transformation considering I expected hardly any noticeable results. TL;DR: went off of hormonal birth control and my libido skyrocketed EDIT: I had no idea this would blow up like this! All of your comments are making me smile, and I sincerely hope it gives at least one person the curiosity to try something else if they suspect their mental health is being affected by hormonal BC. EDIT 2: I wanted to clarify that I know many people use the pill for reasons other than contraception, and that's awesome. This is just my experience of being off of something that literally hurt my mental health for 15 years. It was happening without my knowledge! But no demonizing here, just giving some hope to those that may feel the same way. Even if you try to go off for a bit and decide it's not for you, the pill, IUD's, shots, rings, and implants are all there waiting! All posts I read were how to switch to other hormonal forms of BC, and I just want people to feel normal if they decide to completely remove hormonal options or if they needed someone to relate to! EDIT 3: I have never received any type of awards, thank you all so much! The vibe in this post/comments section is amazing and so supportive! EDIT 4: Looks like this post was locked, but wanted to say thank you for such a supportive group of people! So happy that this post helped some realize that bc is the right choice for them atm, and gave others the curiosity to try to go without! So fun chatting with you all 🤍","The exact same thing happened with me! It’s amazing! Everything you described, libido, anxiety, clear headed... all of it!! I feel like myself again finally!  Congratulations! Hahah yay!",1419
mh32mo,"Me (28F) and my husband (33M) have been married for 3 years and together for a total of 6 years. We've had our ups and downs in the realtionship. We love each other so much, and have/had great understanding and communications. Our sex life has always been average to above normal. I don't have a very high sex drive, and so does he. So, things are pretty vanilla. However, it's satisfactory for both of us. A month ago, my husband started to change, he started to ask for sex more. He also started to become more aggressive in sex (not the bad aggressive but the good one). It was so out of order for us, but to be completely honest I do enjoy this change. As a matter of fact it started to change my own sex drive itself and I found myself wanting him more and seeking sex with him more. During this month we became very adventurous and daring and our sex life went to a whole awesome wonderful level. Around two days ago, I decided to go to my husband to surprise him at his work. Something I never did before. I dressed nice, put on makeup and went to his work. When I got there I saw him interacting with one of his female coworkers (around my age or a little bit younger). I waited for them to finish but kept watching them. What I saw was her clearly trying to seduce him, and believe me women know these things. He kept keeping his distance and eventually the talk ended. I saw it from out of the office, their office spaces have big glass doors. When I entered his office, he was aroused. I know his facial expressions when he gets aroused and he was, oh my God, he was completely aroused. He was happy with my visit, and took the rest of the day off. We went had lunch together then went home where we had sex. At night we were talking and I mentioned what I saw, and told him what was that? He said that ever since she came to the office, she have been all over him that way. And it drives him crazy. He even told the HR but apparently nothing happened cause she keeps repeating this with him. He told me that nothing has nor will it ever happen between them and that he loves me to the death. I believe him. However, reflecting back on al of this, and what he told me, he became more sexually active with me when all of that started with him. And it makes me wonder, am I NOT good enough for him he needs another woman to excite him so he can come and have sex with me? I really don't know how to feel about all of this. In my head, he wanted me and enjoyed me. But now I know for a fact he's was horny cause of another woman!. I mean what should I do now? Should I tell him how I feel? Should I stop his advances for a little bit so I can clear my head? Please any advice would help me. &#x200B; **Update:** Thanks for everyone who responded to my previous post and gave me advice. It was much appreciated. So, last night I waited to have a talk with him before bed. We had some wine and we talked about the matter. I told him about everything I'm feeling and how the whole situation makes me feel. To be completely honest his answers are making me shaking until now, I couldn't even sleep. He said that her advances towards him started mild, flirty words, etc. Then she started to come at him more aggressively, dropping hints, and then touching him. He went to the HR and told them about the situation. He and the HR laughed about it, and the HR told him he will document it in case she reciprocated badly or anything, but at the end they took it as a laugh. After that she became more aggressive with him, to the point that one day she brushed her breast on his back. He told me that this day he lost it for a little and he and her made out in the office. He then stopped and told her he's married. After that he lost it three more times more and they made out, and she even started to give him oral sex but he tells me he stopped her and told her to end everything and since then he stopped everything with her. When he ""ended"" things he felt guilt towards me, and decided to become a better husband by becoming better lover to me, and started to have sex more with me. As I mentioned before neither me nor him did have a high sex drive before, so he told me he was planning on being a better lover for me and have a little more bit of sex, however, it turned out that I liked it and we ended up having more sex than what he planned. I asked him if he slept with her? He said NO. I asked him if he visualize her when he sleeps with me? He didn't want to answer at first but ended up saying yes. He imagines himself having sex with her when he's with me. He started to apologize to me, and I asked him; How would he feel if I was in his shoes and told him what he told me now? He said to not make a big deal of it, but I insisted I know the answer, he said he'd be disgusted with me and no way he'd stay married to me. I didn't say anything after that. He tried to apologize to me more than once, but I really couldn't process all these information. Today's morning, he texted me from work and told me he'll be staying at his parent's place for a little while, so we both can clear our heads and can move on forward with out lives. I still haven't spoken to him yet, and I honestly don't know what to do nor how to deal with the bomb he dropped on me last night. Anyway, I just wanted to thank everyone who had helped me and gave me advice before. Thank you and I wish you never experience any sadness in your lives.","Update - husband is verified scummy cheater. My condolences to OP. You watched him refuse her advances when he didn’t think you were around - I would say that’s a pretty clear indication he isn’t into her. Someone flirting with your hubby was probably a big boost of confidence and he took that to the bedroom. However, if it does bother you, talk to him about it! Explain your feelings and get it off your chest.",6943
mhr4h3,"Last night I just didn't have the mental or physical energy for sex. I would've loved to end a long ass day balls deep inside my gf, but I was too exhausted and too defeated and all I wanted to do was chill out. I made that clear to my gf without making it seem like there was anything wrong with her, but despite my best efforts to turn her down gently, she continued to initiate sex. I literally had to stop her from unzipping my pants more than once.  Part of me understood her persistence. We've only been dating for 3 months so it's safe to say we're still in the honeymoon phase. Most of the time we're all over each other. She's never heard me say no to sex before. Last night was the first time. It didn't go well. When she finally realized my no actually meant no, she decided to leave me alone. As soon as sex was off the table she cut our evening short and went home.  This morning I noticed my gf posted on TikTok asking her followers if they also have to beg their boyfriends to fuck them. It got 9k views and over 200 comments. Almost all those comments encouraged my gf to end our relationship and find a real man who's prepared to please her all day every day. A few of her followers even suggested I might be gay for turning down an attractive girl like her. I expected my gf to stick up for me but all of her responses were basically just LOL and heart emojis. Please help me understand why I deserved such a bad reaction. Is it not sexually acceptable for guys to say no to sex? **Edit:** I just got home from work. Really appreciate all the input. Some of the people who follow my gf on TikTok managed to find me on IG and post all kinds of insensitive messages. I was forced to make my account private because random strangers were asking me if my penis was big enough, if I still loved my gf, if I was cheating, etc. I've been ignoring all my gf's calls. Btw she's deleted the TikTok video. She probably wants to tell me that. I just don't give a fuck right now. The damage is done.","This is red flag territory, friend.

mi9yud,"Is anyone else like this? I'm a 22 y/o straight guy. Maybe I'm just less interested in sex cause I'm getting older? I had a higher sex drive as a teenager.

EDIT: A lot of people are saying this is pretty normal. I'll elaborate a bit more. I almost never see anyone I actually want to have sex with.

mj09qz,"I was sexually abused by my godfather between the ages of 6-8 and it wasn’t until I went to my health class in middle school that I realized I was sexually abused/assaulted. My first kiss, my first sexual oral experience was taken from me before I could even write a sentence. From middle school to now, I have struggled with this trauma and had a lot of hatred for this man and for myself because I felt that it was my fault for never telling my parents.  In the last year I have gone to therapy and have talked to my close friends about this situation. One of them told me an analogy though that has helped me claim my virginity and I am able to say my first kiss was my boyfriend in high school, not a 50 year old pedophile. The analogy goes like this. Compare your first kiss or virginity to a car you own. This car is yours and you know it. If your car gets stolen, it is still your car. Some person stole it and thats because they’re terrible, it’s not your fault your car got stolen. It is still your car. However, if you decide to sell your car, thats your choice. You made the choice to sell your car, and then it is no longer your car.  I’m making this post for people who had a similar experience or dealt with an issue like this. I have found comfort in this analogy for a year now and anytime I think about what happened, I remember this and know what my first everything really was for me. Its been ten years since it happened and I never think about it unless it’s a really bad day for me where I am struggling mentally. I have healed and I will continue to do so, but for everyone out there, it does get better. EDIT: thank you everyone for being so kind. you guys are all very sweet, im glad that this is getting some traction to help others in similar situations. the community has been so sweet and supportive and has made my night a good one. EDIT 2: THANK YOU GUYS i woke up to so many kind messages and ALSO?? THANK YOU FOR THE AWARDS i cant believe i’ve received so many hugs and just little nods for kindness. Im trying to respond to everyone but thank you, im glad this post is really helping some of you and I hope that you all have a good day <3 Thank you reddit for listening to a story that has kept me quiet for almost a decade.","sorry to hear what happened to you, and also that analogy was genius, props to your friend.

mjzzr4,"We’re both in our mid 20s and have been dating for two years now. I’ll be honest - when I first met him (through mutual friends) I wasn’t really fond of him. He was a player and it seemed like everyone knew about his sex life and how many girls he was sleeping with. I didn’t dislike him but wasn’t interested either.  After a while we got to know each other and he asked me out on a date (he was surprisingly sweet). I was too busy for relationships at the time so we kind of had an on/off thing where we went on dates every now and then. I thought this would cause him to move on but he stuck around and we grew closer over the months.   A couple of days ago we were discussing our relationship and he randomly confessed that he fell in love with me because I didn’t “put out right away”. I asked him to elaborate and he said that he’d never have a serious relationship with a girl who sleeps with him on the first date. Then he said that I didn’t have sex with him until 4 months after we initially met. First of all, I had no idea this was the case (I wasn’t keeping track) and find it kinda weird he knows the exact date.  He said that meaningless sex was causing him depression and he was worried that he would never find a girl to settle down with because they were always so “easy”. He literally said that he entirely judges a girl’s character based on how soon she sleeps with him after they meet.  I told him that there’s nothing wrong with a girl who wants to have sex early and that it’s fucked up to lose respect for her. He said that it’s “natural” for guys to feel that way and that he couldn’t help but think less of those girls. I was pretty shocked since he was so blunt and told him that his views on women and sexuality are very outdated and fucked up.  He claimed that during the first 4 months he challenged himself not to sleep with any girl until he slept with me. I find that v hard to believe but he says that I made him excited about sex again and he liked the fact I gave him such a “hard time” (not that I was aware of giving him a hard time). Idk, none of this sits right with me. I feel like it’s objectifying, like I was a conquest. It’s degrading.  I was upset and didn’t really talk to him afterwards. He kept saying that he deeply loves and cares about me and that I should actually feel flattered that he thinks so highly of me. That didn’t make it better, in fact it was offensive. Any thoughts? Am I overreacting or are his views a red flag?",Would you be happy for him to be a father to your daughter? Edit: Thanks for the award! My first!,3592
mqhl7v,So I met this guy a few weeks ago and he came over and we had a lot of sexual tension. Lots of making out and heavy petting but we chose not to have sex and to save it for next time.  Now while texting him should I let him know that I masturbated thinking of him? (We've never really sexted before but we have mentioned over texts how we miss making out with each other and also indirectly saying how we wish we could've fucked). Or is saying that a bit too much? Do guys like to know that or am I pushing it?,Yes! I did that and we are now in a 2 year relationship and he still to this day remembers when i first told him that. he is very proud of it haha,5203
mr9xus,"He just wants cuddles, intimacy, good conversation and to use toys on me. He spoils me rotten. Honestly I'm really loving it, and he's consistent at making me cum, and doesn't seem to mind not ""receiving"" at all.  He will just casually pet me and put his hand there, after I come we just fall asleep in a pile.  I'm amazed.  Is this real? People are like this? He can just be happy giving me sexual attention and watching me cum and feeling good about it?  Bros.  What even is life right now",Yes. There are some guys who get a lot of their pleasure from the pleasure they give to their partner.

I don’t always need to think about him to get off but, when I feel like I’m struggling to get aroused, I do it. Whether I’m in bed with myself or someone else... It  feels f**king amazing in the moment, but it feels unhealthy... afterwards. It even makes me feel like I’m taking advantage of these guys in the dating pool for my own stimulation. I feel lost, and I don’t know the right course of action to develop healthy sex habits anymore. I haven’t done this in a long time. I thought he would be mine forever. He told me he was.

I mean I probably could've pulled out with some strenuous effort but it would not have been easy. I then looked down at her and saw her grinning up at me.

mx1pht,"So I’m a straight guy (27M) and I was browsing pornhub, and I found a channel that I found myself surprisingly into. It was called “Hot Guys fuck”. It consists of a really hot guy and a really hot girl. They talk for a bit. The camera man sometime makes them play a sexy truth or dare, and to get them horny, and builds sexual tension and then they fuck. While there is a bit too much focus on the guy’s body for my personal liking, it’s still really hot. The girl seems like she is enjoying herself and there genuinely feels like the sexual tension between them. I sometimes have a hard time getting into the crummy acting of a typical porno, and amateur porn lacks context and decent production value, so we there is no tension built. I hear most of these complaints about porn  are from women.  I want more porn, where  girl actually get seduced. Just curious to see who can relate.

myivp3,"Me (26F) and my BF (33M) have been in a relationship for almost two years. He's always the one to rock my world when it comes to sex. I've been reading a lot and thinking of different things to do with him to return the favor. Last night, I started out as usual, then took complete control (something I never felt comfortable to do before). I made him lay down on his back and I had my way with him. Womanhandled him if that's a word. I sucked him, made him edge for a long time, worshipped his penis and body, made him cum orally, spent time kissing him and saying how much I love him and adore him and can't live without him, until he got hard again and then rode him for a long time. All of that while he was laying on his back. I rode him with several angles and changed my leg position every now and then. He came with such a force that I think I felt his sperm shooting forcefully inside of me. If that's even possible. Anyway, the whole night was about him not me. And after he came inside of me and I was kissing all of his face he started to shake and then cried. He legit cried his heart out, and I got to his side and embraced him until he felt asleep in my arms. Today we wake up as usual, he was happier and kind of bashful, smiling, and kind of shy around me, then he suddenly grabed me, kissed me and then gave me one of his best oral sex yet, he made me cum two times. I told him what was that about? And he told me he just loves me. And left for work. I've never been with a guy who cried after sex at all. I was very content with myself. But I also want to know. Does that mean he is love deprived and wants more nights like this? Or is this something many guys do when they have powerful orgasms? Cause last night it was the most powerful orgasm I saw him have with me. Need your opinions. ***Edit:*** Me taking control like that has been discussed before, and he wanted me to do it for so long. I was the one who didn't feel comfortable enough to take charge. However, I took it an extra step and made the whole night dedicated to him and about him without asking for anything in return from him sexually. Just wanted to put that out there. ",Us guys aren’t robots. The majority of us are told by society that we should aim to be stoic and the rock that every woman wants and it sinks in to most of us or at least in my opinion.  He was clearly feeling so much emotion that he started crying. Guys need to be loved and cared for sometimes and it’s great when we can let our guard down and feel protected by our SO. I would probably cry if a girl I was in a relationship with said/done that to me. Ask him what he thought of it and go from there.,2718
myx29n,"Throw away account for obvious reasons. I (F, 38) met up with a younger male from a dating app for a hookup that I was hopeful could turn into a FWB situation. Things were going well and we talked a lot for a few hours, which led into good kissing/foreplay. After trying to give him BJ for over 30 mins (I have never had any complains on them before all have been to completion) we took a break and the dude feel asleep! I was like WTF. I gave him plenty of time to wake up (over 45 mins) and even made lots of noise going to the bathroom. Dude never woke up so I left. Apparently he didn’t have any alarms for his work the next day and got into work late because of all this and is telling me that is was a big deal him being late and is pissed at me for not only leaving but not waking him up.  I asked my friends who said it was not my responsibility to wake him or make sure alarms were set as this was only the first time meeting. I felt bad leaving but feel that I gave him ample to wake. He said I should have physically woken him, but again not my responsibility and further more, I don’t know him, what if I woke him up and he was angry for me leaving or aggressive for sex which could have upped the situation to dangerous. What do you all think.","Naw, not your fault at all. Usually I try to play advocate for both sides. Dunno if the dude has some sleeping disorder that he falls asleep in the middle of meeting up with you. If not, that was rude as hell of him. If so, still not your problem, because none of this was communicated to you nor your responsibility. I have an alarm set up for every weekday, because I'm an adult. Him not waking up is completely his responsibility. Edit - Doubt if you plan on seeing him again, but I will add that him blaming you for this is a big red flag, so I'd stay away if I were you.",6200
mzd856,"Are any other women here (or men) really turned on by *slight* dominance, but HATE being degraded? Maybe it’s just me but there’s a fine line between what I find hot and what will instantly take me out of the mood and piss me off. I’m pretty vanilla lol but I like it when I’m pushed up against a wall, picked up, choked, held down and dirty talked to. We’re making out? Great, flip me onto the bed and start taking my clothes off. Hold my hands down. But if a guy were to tell me to get on my knees/beg for anything/slap me/put his dick in my face, there are no words for the rage that would ensue. Calling me a good girl when I’m about to orgasm = hot as hell, but calling me a good girl if you’re face fucking me = not. I think I just like it when a guy takes control and is a bit forceful, but the moment I feel disrespected or objectified, I’m done.

Be pretty clear about the ""good girl"" thing though,  because that sounds like something he could mess up easily and kill the mood.

We have a great relationship. She also happens to have an identical twin and they are pretty close. They've been staying together here since they started university(they go to different universities though). They are a bit different personality wise, but the twin is also a very kind girl and we get along pretty well. Naturally we all hang out together very often and I am pretty comfortable with both of them. I think of her twin as my own sister in a way. Anyway, the twin was dating this guy(30M) for almost a year. I never particularly liked him, I thought he was an arrogant prick, but I tolerated him when we all hung out together for drinks once in a while. Well, turns out I was correct. He was cheating on her with his ex and they eventually broke up(this was 6 months ago). Needless to say that the girl was devastated. She took it very hard. She became kinda depressed and her self esteem and self worth weren't doing that great. The fact that it was her first relationship didn't help either I guess. She started not wanting to go out that much. We tried to do our best to drag her out of course to see and meet new people and why not even hook up with someone. I even tried to set her up with one of my friends, who was single at the time and honestly a great guy overall, but no bueno. And it's not only us. Her own friends also tried to help her, but she just won't cooperate. She says she wants to meet nice guys, yet she is always bitchy and whiny about it, never liking anyone. She keeps comparing them to that prick. Simultaneously she keeps whining and saying she is not pretty enough and other crap like that, which is not even remotely true, but no matter how many times we tell her she just won't believe it. Now I know she is feeling pretty down about the whole thing and I understand that and don't hate her, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't find it annoying, because it started affecting our relationship. My gf always worries about her and tries to help her a little too much, they proceed to fight and then my gf takes it out on me. And we're not even at the good part yet. So yesterday my gf was staying at my place. We had sex and afterwards we were lying down talking. You know usual stuff. Until she says she wants to ask me for a big favor. I am like sure. Then proceeds to tell me she'd like me to have sex with her sister. At first like any sane man I thought that either she was joking or that I fell asleep and was dreaming I was starring in one of those porn movies with twins. Sadly she wasn't joking at all and I was wide awake. She probably realized I had a wtf look on my face and then proceeded to rationalize it. She told me that her twin already had a slight crush on me and at the moment I am probably the only guy she truly trusts. She said she thinks it will greatly improve her sister's self-esteem and mood. She told me she already talked about it with her twin and the twin was ok with it. She reassured me multiple times she won't get mad about it and she won't even be present, she could just stay at my place while I go to theirs and do the deed! It will only be one time and I could just pretend her sister was her she said. Hell I don't even have to take the whole thing seriously, I just need to have sex with her sister and then ""hold her tightly"" for a bit so that she feels wanted and desired and crap like that! She was practically begging me to bang her sister. Meanwhile I was standing there listening to her without being able to utter a word, that was how surprised I was. In the end I said I'll think about it for a bit and left it at that. I couldn't fucking sleep that night. That was yesterday. Today I am kinda avoiding my gf, we texted a bit and thank god she hasn't mentioned anything about it... yet. I am freaking out. Twin threesome jokes aside, I don't think this is normal. She was talking about it like it was nothing. The sex itself is probably not such a big deal for me, I mean they look almost exactly the same and I am pretty comfortable with her twin, but I think if I accept it can potentially ruin our relationship. She says she won't get mad, but I heavily doubt it, and I also heavily doubt it will help her sister, unless something suspicious is going on that I am not aware of. Also, I am fearing that if I have sex with the twin, not only things might get really awkward between the three of us, but the twin might later get jealous and start sabotaging our relationship. My gf was pretty serious about the whole thing though, she looked like she really wanting me to do it. I am having some really dark thoughts right now. Perhaps the twin is manipulating her and is taking advantage of my gf and me. Perhaps my gf is weirder than usual. I feel guilty having such thoughts for two girls I hold in high regard. Oh man I fucking have no clue what to do. I am thinking of suggesting that we get her to therapy to feel better or something. I've talked about this with two of my friends, but the fuckers just won't take the situation seriously. I am getting paranoid at this point, but I just don't want to ruin this nice thing I have with my gf, that's all.  __UPDATE__: Damn I didn't really expect this to get upvoted to the moon. I read and skimmed through most of your comments guys. Anyway, here's a brief update. So I met with my girlfriend earlier today and it went pretty good I think. We met and talked(she brought it up). Turns out she was feeling like shit the whole time yesterday, deeply ashamed and terrified. She started crying saying she was regretting it all day yesterday and she now is 100% sure she doesn't want to share me with anyone, she doesn't even want to imagine me being inside another woman, and was terrified that if I said yes then she wouldn't be able to do anything to stop it since she suggested it. She mentioned that she is deeply sorry and is now afraid that I think she is not normal and I am going to leave her and stuff. I reassured her that I love her, I think she is perfectly normal and I am not intending to leave her or anything like that. Once things calmed down a bit, we talked about what prompted it. Apparently she and her sister talk an awfully fucking lot about sex and relationships and are very open about it, which in turn means they are talking about our relationship and me a lot. According to my gf, the sister has fantasized quite a few times about me, how I would look naked or when having sex, but my gf never thought anything of it since it wasn't particularly serious as in I'll steal your bf(and to be fair throughout the relationship I never once got the impression that the sister was hitting on me at any point or doing something looking to escalate things). My gf admitted she was actually flattered her sister found me attractive and desirable. Things got more intense this last month though and the sister was way more vocal about it. My gf eventually started entertaining the idea of me getting intimate with her sister. Not in a ""it's hot"" kind of way but more of a ""wanting to share something I greatly treasure"" kind of way as per her words. They talked about it and the sister was very on board with it. That's pretty much it. We are both meeting the sister in the evening to clear things up, hopefully things go back to the way they were, I mean it's not like anything bad has actually happened.","Yeah definitely do not do this. It'll not only change your relationship with your girlfriend, it'll change her relationship with her sister. Forever.  ***Maybe*** it'll only change it slightly but even that could be the end of things for you. The sister could catch feelings. The girlfriend could change her mind and end up jealous. *You* could catch feelings for the sister. Anything could happen and almost none of it is good for you.  And honestly it's a little demeaning to you, are you some dick rental service?  Here's what you do. You sit them both down and say, ""I care very much about you both and I know how much you mean to each other. I would never dream of coming between you **[phrasing]** so I don't think this is a good idea. Sister, you're attractive and worthy of love. You got hurt and that's not your fault. Gf & I are going to be here for you and someday soon you're going to find someone who deserves you."" Then give them both a big hug and go bang their mom.",5326
n0zn7n,I like to cook. I like to fuck. But apparently offering if I could make a meal after sex is very strange? How would you feel if offered? I don’t mean like a whole three course meal I just mean something small and easy. I’d hate someone to visit my place and leave on an empty stomach.,dude. i would kill for a casual partner that didn't just leave or make me leave without hanging out or eating something rather than pretend that a casual conversation is somehow more uncomfortable than humping our sweaty naked bodies against each other. it is the BARE minimum and i envy the women that sleep with you,4192
n2i49u,"I had many partners, I was very promiscuous. I had lots of sex. I realized I hated my own company and I wanted so badly to not be alone. So I would switch from situation to situation relationship to relationship. I had sex for the sake of it. I never experienced pleasure or orgasm. Many men tried many different things for sometimes hours at a time nothing worked. I felt broken and fucked up... I didnt want to have sex anymore, why should I ? it did nothing for me.    Until I met my current partner. It was pure love. He made me wait a long time getting to know me before we had sex.  He gave me my first ever orgasm by making out with me and stimulating my breasts with our clothes on.    When we first had sex I came 6 times within an hour rapidly. I was so overwhelmed I cried.     I feel like love was I always needed all along, no one  else had ever touched me so lovingly. He is not my usual type. I even rejected him at first. But now it is pure love. And he can make me shake and convulse just by gently kissing me. This is insane. Anyone else relate?",Well that’s a twist on the Cinderella story.,1458
n31zz5,"In porn, it usually follows the same formula. 15 minutes of a girl blowing the guy, she is putting on a huge performance, eyes watering, looking up at him all desperate and pleading. Then 2 minutes of a guy going down on her, again, she's putting on a huge performance of moaning and squirming and then sex sex sex sex sex. And then cum shot. And then over. I HATE THIS FORMULA. And if porn is your biggest exposure to sex, this is all you know. And a lot of the sex I've had follows this formula. It really doesn't get me off and is very male-centric.  I've had the pleasure of sleeping with a guy who follows no formula, just does what feels good, which includes fucking me, stopping to go down on me some, fucking more, maybe cumming, going down on me again, kissing each other, me going down on him, hand stuff, him going down on me...so on and so forth, only ending when we're exhausted. Not because he's cum. That's never why it ends. And he's not afraid to go down on me after his penis has been in me, it is so hot. He doesn't even care if he's cum inside me, will still go down on me. THATS the hottest (though not everyone's cup of tea). Having sex like this just further contrasts with the blaringly awful porn formula.  Foreplay doesn't always have to go first. It can be done whenever. And should be done throughout. Once PIV has started, it doesn't mean all foreplay is over. And please PLEASE it doesn't have to end because the guy has cum. If you get tired after you've cum, you should still ask ""do you want to cum again, baby?"" (I added the baby, because that's super hot tk me) just to gauge where your partner is at.  Anyway. I guess this isn't a question, so may get taken down, but hey. Please read and consider. And/or tell me about the hot foreplay that has happened to you during sex! Or how do you end sex with you and your partner? Cool, thanks.","If anyone who hasn't had sex yet is trying to get ideas from watching porn... PLEASE STOP!   It's nothing like porn, and I agree that porn is made with only men in mind. Do what feels good and what your partner likes! :)",2137
n5ogre,[removed],"Sex therapy is a great start, but it sounds like you both need solo counselling too. Your resentment is completely understandable.

When you start to think about your partner like this - with contempt and disrespect - you're getting into a territory that is very difficult to come back from. That's not to say this is an unfair reaction. I just mean that you should think about whether you can get back to a place of respect. Whether you really trust him to try to change.

n6aeaz,"My boyf and I met after a month since I turned 18. I’m turning 19 in September of this year. Anyway, we both acknowledged the age gap, but we got along really well + have similar values in life. Overall I thought our relationship was healthy. We never fought and it’s a monogamous relationship. We always communicated our feelings effectively to each other.  (NSFW / TW) My boyf and I have sex multiple times a week. Sometimes, we’ll get into the mood and completely forget about the condom and other times we remember just to be safe. I never ever take out the trash and only he ever does it. But because he was at work, I decided to do it. We fucked before he left for work early this morning and i instantly saw the condom and noticed the tiny holes poked. It just shocked me and I didn’t really know what to do. Before he’s made jokes about getting me pregnant and I didn’t take him seriously. He tried to convince me to not get on BC and wherever he’s about to finish he’ll use our safe word so I can get off him.","Um, do you WANT to be a mother at 18? Because that's about to happen.

n6yw7e,"My (20F) FWB (25M) and I have been seeing each other for a handful of months on and off. Last night after sex we were cuddling just to recoup a bit before going for another round. Now...I’ve paid compliments to him before, Just here and there, like he looks good today and he smells nice, yknow...the normal set of compliments, he usually brushes it off and jokes about it, kind of in a manner like he doesn’t believe it. I was kind of in my come down stage and I gave him a really specific compliment on his nose, and his eyes. He has always been self conscious about these features but I’ve always....liked them. He seemed shocked, and taken aback. I asked if I was overstepping because of the arrangement we have, he said no. So I asked why he seemed shocked. He told me nobody had ever complimented him like that before.  It made me extremely sad to hear that, and it got me thinking about how many men might go without compliments. I’ve read several things about men not getting enough compliments but I want to know if this is actually a true statement.  Edit: Hi all! I just wanted to say thank you so much for all the responses as well as the awards as well. I am trying my best to go through and respond to all the comments! I’m just glad I’ve been able to bring up this type of conversation. Thank you so much for all the interactions on this post!","It's true.

n904xg,"I am a 22f, who went on a date with a 22m. First date went great, lots in common and chemistry. Definitely had sexual chemistry. Before our next date, I mentioned to him to bring condoms as I was open to having sex with him. He didn’t disagree to this.  Now to the next date, all is going well invite him back to my place and we start hooking up and go down on one another. Next thing I know, he is about to put his dick in me without a condom. I obviously stop him and ask to put a condom on, he says he hasn’t brought any, no worries I say, I think I have some. I manage to find them and then he decides that he won’t have sex with one because “never used them before with girls and can’t have sex with one”. But assured me he isn’t sleeping with anyone else and because I’m on birth control, there is no issue.  Obviously, considering he has never used one with a girl, I definitely was not wanting to have unprotected sex. I explained that it was still early days and we were not exclusive yet and therefore I wasn’t comfortable not using a condom. Cut to 30min later he begins kissing me again and grinding on me naked and then tried to push the issue again. I say no again, he decides he doesn’t want to see me again.  Since when did protected sex become uncool? Why would a guy refuse to wear a condom? Is he not concerned about STDs himself?  Surely this isn’t the new normal...  Edit: Did not expect this to blow up the way it has! Just wanted to thank people for the support and advice. It has definitely been a lesson learnt and it’s nice to know there are some people out there who still support safe sex! Safe sex meaning, condoms and/or testing and respecting boundaries.","Wow.

n9wp4z,"I'm F19, and an unfortunate 4'8. I'm no longer insecure about this or anything. Guys seem to match on bumble/tinder and immediately ask if I want to be dominated or slapped around. They don't ask my normal sized friend shit like this the moment they start talking to them, then why me? Not just on apps, even irl men with whom I have any conversation of sexual nature simply assume that I'm freaky as fuck and want to be ""thrown around"". I met up with a 6'4 guy and all he was doing was throwing me about during sex, I mean literally flinging me onto the bed . Every person above 5'5 with whom I have been does the same routine of - Just holding my entire body and jackhammering me. Every woman knows that jackhammering can be extremely painful especially when the man has a bigger penis or if you have smaller lady parts. Am I just meeting assholes (my body count is like 8 so I really haven't experienced a lot) or do other petite women experience this bullshit???

nb9bsc,"It’s not until my last relationship that I noticed how much porn influences what men know about sex and it makes me feel sad that what men know about sex and what women are supposed to “like” is based off a complete false reality? I mean, if a man loves you he should bother to take the time to learn about your body... about what you like as an individual so I know as a gender us women are going to be okay but it makes me sad that porn is so targeted at men that women ultimately suffer.  It wasn’t until I did anal with my partner for the first time (his first time) and he totally thought it was okay to go from anal to regular sex straight back to anal and also, not even asking me for consent to have anal sex - we had never ever done it before, he just assumed my consent was blanket which isn’t. I’m not angry about the consent part like I’m glad he got to try that but it just furthers my point.  Porn is feeding this narrative that isn’t real life whatsoever.   I guess all I can say is if you’re firstly exploring your first sexual experiences consent is always sexy and you’ll never ever ruin the mood and get to know what also feels good for your partner because sex feels and is a completely different experience when you’re both equally invested in making each other feel good and if you’re spending most of your sex life watching porn, please understand that it’s not real! Your sexual experiences in the physical word will be wildly different. In saying that though, self sexuality is a massive part of learning what you do and don’t like so don’t be ashamed for exploring what feels good. EDIT: please have a read through the comments. I honestly had no idea that this post was going to blow up, it was just a lil ramble I had. I didn’t think about it enough to warrant this response, so please have a read through the comments as my opinion is explained further but essentially my points here are:  1. Society has absolutely failed in regards to sex education. We are using pornography which is created as entertainment, as primary educational content. I think porn is great, it’s awesome for sexually active adults to watch for pleasure or for EDUCATIONAL reasons - where they can also apply their BASIC SEXUAL HEALTH COMMON SENSE on-top of the porn and bam you’re ready to go. The concern is when porn is the primary and only sexual education, when that is it. The only time that child has learnt anything is from Lana rhoades on the hub - like, really? Do we expect that to bring safe, healthy sex practices? Absolutely not.  2. When I say a man should take the time to learn to love your body, I specifically mean in a relationship - you should want to learn the ins and outs of their bodies. What they enjoy. How you can do that. You should learn every time you engage in sexual behaviour. I think that for casual sex, no we shouldn’t expect either party to study the other. But you should be having sex differently when you finish to what it was when you started, you learn a lot by body language- it’s not hard to tweak things as you go.  3. My ex sucks and that’s a personality problem, shouldn’t be so entitled to not ask his partner for consent to have anal sex when we had never done it before. The only reason I brought it up is because the reason he thought that was okay was porn, that porn star is 99% chance not doing that at home.  4. It makes me upset with the generalised view men have of sex, I hate that it’s based of fictional characters and not their partner. It makes me upset when a man chooses not to explore their partner individually because “they’ve” got it...when they don’t sadly. And that’s simply because we are all very different. The few men I’ve gotten to know quite seriously all have different views of sex, different ways they like it and that’s the human body. I just wish more men took the time, that’s all! 5. This post does not read: porn sucks, men are fucking assholes.... I fucking love porn, and I love men. I just think we are failing society by not fixing this, I want to fix it not create a divide.","The really shitty thing is that even when I explicitly tell guys upfront that certain common things from porn are hard limits for me, most of them tell me that they do not care, they are still going to do them to me anyway because I'm just wrong, I do not know better and doing those things are all they care about. I block them immediately of course.",1821
nc3dm2,"I [18F] am a lesbian but I have been curious what it feels like to have a dick in me. I have a very close best friend [18M]. I told him I trusted him and asked if he could put his penis in me so I could see what its like. I was nervous but he put it in slowly and gently. When it was in I told him that we can have sex if he wants since he's already in me and that I want to see what its like. So he had sex with me. He was very sweet (kissing my lips and boobs and neck, telling me I'm beautiful, gently playing with my boobs, brushing my hair, holding me, telling me I feel so good, etc) which I appreciated a lot. But while I didn't hate it, I thought the sex still felt a little weird. I loved how he treated me during it and I had fun but I learned straight sex isn't for me. We cuddled for a while after and we started talking about the sex. He told me that it felt great and asked what I thought. I was honest. I told him that I was really happy I got to experience it with him, that I loved how sweet he was to me during it, I thanked him for helping me experiment and being someone I can trust, and that the sex was good and a lot of fun but that straight sex isn't for me. He said he was glad my experience was good, he's flaterred I trust him this much, that he was glad he got to experience it with me too, and that he's happy I found out what I thought of straight sex. I then told him that I'm still down to keep cuddling naked and kissing for the night and then after that I'll stick with girls. So we ended up cuddling and kissing for a while until we fell asleep. In the morning he was very respectful. We woke up spooning. He cuddled like that for a few minutes and then we got up and got dressed and he didn't make any attempt to have sex with me again. That happened 2 weeks ago. I was talking to my (a different) friend and told her about my experience with him. She kept insisting that I must have hurt his feelings by telling him straight sex wasn't for me after and that it was rude to say that and that I led him on. I've hungout with and talked to him since though and he has acted the same as usual. Have you had a similar event occur? Is my friend right that I may have hurt his feelings or led him on?",You had an experiment and you were totally upfront about why you were doing that. Sounds like he had fun but knew what the score was. Saying that people do catch feelings sometimes after having sex so just be a little careful for a bit.,4055

I had only two partners in the past and my experiences with them was not quite the best. They were two years apart and i dont see another partner coming into my life for at least for 2-3  more years. Alltough i crave both emotional and phisycal side of a relationship i tend to stay in my safe zone rather than trying to meet with potential partners.  Trough all that time this place has given me the sex-ed that i never knew i needed, it has taught me how everyone can have a kink and it doesn't mean that they are a freak, it has taught me how to be positive with my body, my fantasies and my insecurities, boosted my self confidence and given me motivation that r/motivation couldn't.  Reading about peoples sexual experiences all around the Globe. Commenting on them, answering some questions here really restored my faith in humanity. I've seen rape victims recovering trough these place or 13-14 year old childeren learning about a healthy sex life instead of watching porn.

ne88fi,"This happened yesterday. My gf (f21) and I (m24) were in bed, cuddling naked and getting ready to fuck. I noticed she wasn't quite as enthusiastic and asked her about it. She told my she was having a hard time getting in the mood. She insisted she wants to have sex but she couldn't clear her mind (she just moved and her job was giving her a hard time so there's enough reasons). She added she doesn't want to disappoint me by just laying there and doing nothing.   I thought about that and handed her her phone. I told her if she wants she can browse Reddit, watch some porn or do whatever distracts her while I do the rest. She hesitated at first but agreed. I continued touching her and eventually started oral and fingering. She came about five minutes in.  I was incredibly happy with the result and she was as well. I don't know what she was looking at but I won't ask, if it's helping then that's a good thing.

nfg07f,"I'm a guy, and wish I had better birth control options.  Condoms and vesectomies have their own problems. Condoms aren't as reliable, and don't feel great. Vesectomies are expensive, and possibly not reversible if you decide later to have kids. Freezing sperm is around $150-$300 a year to store, $500-$2000 for the procedure, and then the artificial insemination....$11k-$12k.  I'm seriously considering the vesectomy but...seems really expensive and risky...like I don't wanna make a bad choice and never be able to have kids. I'd maybe like to have kids! But I'm 26 rn, and I'd like to properly plan it when the time comes with someone. It's a fear of mine like having sex early in dating or relationship and having a kid. Women have IUDs, pills, injections, implants, etc as well...whole bunch of stuff. They also have an abortion as well. I mean if the birth control fails, and I don't want a child right now. I just kind of have no say. Why did these drug companies decide this is a female only problem, like dudes are just walking penises who just cum and run? I mean if I had an unplanned child I'd still do what I could do be a dad. If I want any control over my reproduction it's, rely on rubber, vesectomy, or don't have sex. I want something like a pill, male IUD, something... Usually when you talk about it people just condescendingly say ""well don't have sex"" ah why didn't I think of that so easy lol. EDIT: Totally valid that female contraception can cause hormonal issues. Though I guess my thing would be I'd at least want the option to consider. I mean if anything it's the idea to not just make it a female responsibility. It wasn't meant to be like a who has a worst shit fest lol. EDIT: Ok yes obviously STDs aren't prevented without a condom, but I'm not talking about that here as the concern. The concern is not producing a kid lol. It's annoying to complain that something doesn't exist, and some people just what aboutism it back to it's my fault for wanting more options of male birth control. Yes I use a condom, cause I obviously don't want a kid lol. It's totally beside the point.","RISUG/Vasalgel has been proven highly effective.

I laughed it off, but inside I died a little. I know he’s subscribed to other girls Only fans, but he wouldn’t subscribe to mine? I wouldn’t seriously consider it, but the thought of my boyfriend thinking I’m not attractive enough like the other girls has me questioning my attractiveness again. Edit: To clarify, I wouldn’t consider doing an only fans at all. It was just a stupid joke I made.","Tbf that is pretty mean, I personally would've also been upset about it",5771
ngyyca,"Last night I participated in a threesome with my gf and her gay best friend. My understanding was that the best friend wanted to experience what a vagina feels like and my gf just so happened to have the vagina he wanted. My first reaction was to laugh it off and file that topic under ""never gonna happen"". My gf on the other hand had the opposite reaction. She seemed interested. Her suggestion was that we make a threesome out of it. Something we've talked about in the past but never really proceeded beyond that. She emphasized that it would be a MFM threesome, meaning no sexual interaction between the two guys. I agreed, eventually. The agreement was that it would be a one time experience with the best friend and that the two of us would never do anything sexual to one another.  Not gonna lie, the days leading up to the threesome I kind of got excited. Butterflies in my stomach excited. The idea was growing on me. It was gonna be my first time being that kinky and it made me feel somewhat proud. I was confident that no one would leave the bedroom unhappy based on the boundaries we discussed. But I was wrong. As soon as we were all naked on the bed, the best friend didn't waste much time making advances towards me. At first I would catch him staring at me instead of my gf, which I didn't really mind because I didn't expect him to all of a sudden be straight. However, it became distracting when he would constantly compliment the way my body looked in certain angles and ""accidentally"" touch my shoulders or my ass whenever we changed positions.  The final straw was when my gf was fucking me on the edge of the bed in the reverse cowgirl position while the best friend was bent over in front of my gf, getting his ass eaten. Btw the ass eating was not something we discussed, but I was willing to just go with it. During that moment though my dick slipped out and somehow the best friend managed to grab it before my gf. I couldn't see much from that angle, but I knew the hand on my dick did not belong to my gf. Before I could fully register what was happening, the best friend had my whole dick in his mouth. I'll be the first to admit that I overreacted, but as soon as I realized the best friend was sucking me, I practically did a back flip roll off the bed and fell on my face. My gf asked if I was okay and I said no before explaining that her best friend just sucked my dick.  The best friend apologized and said my gf said I would enjoy it. My gf didn't deny it. In fact, she came clean about orchestrating this whole threesome with her best friend just to watch me fool around with another guy. She explained that it's something she always fantasized about but never had the courage to communicate. I said I didn't understand why she would go through all that trouble when all of us agreed there would be nothing sexual happening between me and the best friend. She said she was hoping I would end up changing my mind once I experienced how hot it was. At that moment the best friend asked if he should leave. I said yes. My gf said no. She was convinced the situation was still salvageable even though sex was the last thing I wanted to do at that point. Long story short, I got dressed and went home.  This morning I had to catch a flight to visit my mom overseas. My gf was supposed to drive with me and my dad to the airport but I decided it would be less awkward if it was just me and my old man. I'm still hurt that she did something like that. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against any expression of intimacy, guy on girl, guy on guy, guy on girl and guy, whatever makes you cum. But the way my gf went about fulfilling her homo-erotic fantasy is making me question our relationship. Is this red flag territory? Like, I dunno, I've never had a gf before.","You are 100 percent in the right, for feeling betrayed by being forced into an act that you did not consent to - when clear boundaries were set up.  What went down is seriously fucked up... Sorry to hear that happened.",5955
nhox7c,"She's become quite popular on TikTok and IG in recent months. Last time I checked she had just under 10k followers on both apps. She had no more than 200 when we first met. Most of her posts at that time were relatively innocent in a sense that they were focused on her spending time with friends, doing skateboarding tricks, etc. All of that changed when she posted a video of her getting a tattoo just below her belly button. Obviously she had to show some skin to get the tattoo, and even though she wasn't like naked or anything, it was more than enough nudity to attract a decent amount of online attention. Since then, she's embraced her sexuality a lot more. Almost all of her posts have been one step away from Only Fans territory.  Her most recent TikTok is actually what prompted me to share this post. She posted a video of her sitting on the edge of the bed with me sleeping in the background. She was wearing what she calls pajamas and what I call underwear. She slowly proceeded to pull down the blanket to reveal that I'm not wearing a shirt. She continued pulling until the blanket reached my waist. The video stops there with her biting her bottom lip and seductively smiling at the camera. Cue thousands of views and likes. Most of the comments requested a part 2. A few even said the sex must have been good for me to be passed out like that. Ironically, there was never any sex. My gf made it clear to me since day one she was not about that sex before marriage life, which I respected.  She gave me a hand job one time and that was the most sexual thing we have ever done to date. It's been a year since that hand job. Sometimes I masturbate to her content on social media because she's more sexual on there than she is with me. I will never put pressure on her (or anyone) to have sex with me, but based on what I've been seeing online, I just can't help but feel like she's using up all her sexual affection on the internet instead of in our relationship. I want to respect her wish to wait until marriage before doing anything sexual with another person, but marriage is not even on our minds at the moment. How do I encourage my gf to show me the same sexual energy she shows thousands of random strangers, without sounding like I'm either implying that she's a hypocrite or that I'm disrespecting her values?  FML. This was supposed to be a one paragraph post. Sorry. **EDIT:** Thank you so much for all the feedback. I never expected to attract so much attention on this sub. I'm sorry I didn't respond to all of you, I could no longer keep up with the volume of comments coming through. I just wanted to provide an update so that I don't leave my post so open ended. I talked to my gf. Thanks to the advice on here, I was more confident in what I wanted to communicate. In short, she said she knew I was gonna ""break"" eventually because at the end of the day ""guys want girls who want sex"". Not gonna lie, from there I kind of lost control of the conversation. She became annoyed at my comment about consent and wasted no time deleting the recent TikTok of me sleeping, even though I didn't ask her to delete it. I became so overwhelmed that I decided to show her this thread. Big fucking mistake. She accused me of making her sound like a slut. Then she cried and said it's ironic because here I was complaining on the internet about her getting so much attention for being sexual, and yet, my first response was to discuss her sexual behaviour with horny strangers on a sex site, and not only get hundreds of messages and thousands of upvotes, but also awards for it. She said that made both of us sluts. We decided to drop the subject for the evening because we were both getting emotional and saying hurtful things. We went our separate ways and have yet to speak again. Not quite the happily ever after I was hoping for.",I am reminded of this article I just read: https://harpers.org/archive/2021/06/tiktok-house-collab-house-the-anxiety-of-influencers/,2344
niqq7v,"I came back home early last week to find him in the living room....doing what he usually does... watching something on his phone ...but the striking difference was that he had my tied a pony tail for himself(he has long black hair),  wearing my small top, my garments and my pantyhose.  On confrontation he just burst into his room and locked himself, changed and started apologising Because he thought I would get mad.  I didn't freak out.  I did call him back, told him he looked adorable, that it's perfectly okay if he likes them and I think he looked beautiful. Told him it's normal, it's nothing wrong, nothing to be ashamed of and I I even asked him if he would wear them again for me.  I've found out that he has been using scissors on some of his old clothing....he used to cut his own clothing and garments to make them more revealing and feminine. This was before he realised he could just steal my clothes.  he switched to my clothing. He was stealing my clothes. And I found a stash of my clothes in his room. He said that he's not trans...he just loves the feel of it.....so it's either that he just loves the clothing or its a Fetish.  TL;DR - son is a cross dresser, how can I help and support him?

nj3zdw,"Please don’t judge me for this.  I lost a bet with my bf and agreed to a “free use night” with my bf and his friend which I thought just meant they could initiate sex that night whenever they want. Instead, they were very rough and mean. I got slapped around, choked, etc. They even did things I had specifically said no to (anal). When I’d ask them to stop, they kept going saying I agreed to it.  Now I know they were high and a little drunk but this is not what I wanted. I feel like I was abused. Is this really what free use is??",They abused you. Please leave. Even in BDSM where there are agreements and a safeword its not a password and no still means no legally and morally.

nkw7e4,"I’m 22(m) and in my short time on this planet I’ve not cum with a partner once it’s not a mental thing nor a physical thing it’s genuinely I rarely ever have sex with women and enjoy it, not because I’m not attracted to women but because I keep running into certain habits that just don’t feel good, kill the mood or completely make me lose interest.  For example every blowjob I’ve had has been very toothy, every handjob I’ve ever had has felt like the girl is trying to simultaneously crush my  dick and rip it off my body, I constantly end up doing 95% of the work and whenever they go on top after barely 30 seconds I hear “I’m tired”, or they’re a complete dead fish who seem to think they’ve rocked my world. I’ve tried telling women how I like things but I’m then greeted with tears or they take it as a personal insult and get mad defensive about it. The constant comments I’ve heard women make about men being terrible in bed had previously made me very insecure and I  now know the importance of foreplay, never assume every vagina is the same and I’m always very receptive to communication among many other things I’ve learnt purely because I don’t want to be the butt of some girls joke and I want to please my partners.  But in my experience the inverse just does not occur I rarely ever hear anyone talk about it and I’m so tired of having to stroke egos when I just want to have sex and not have it end with horrendous blue balls. So why is it there just isn’t this conversation because from conversations with my friends I am far and away not the only guy that feels this way? EDIT: I appreciate some of the comments actually answering the question but my God the way some of you are trying to go out of your way to paint me as some entitled asshole when I’m very much not is actually quite mad.  For those that are so inclined when I say they cry I don’t mean they literally cry I mean they take any pointers as a personal slight, i mean I suddenly get insults hurled my way get accusations thrown at me or I just get flat out ignored or passive aggressive remarks. I never say anything to antagonise I always try to be extremely careful about how I word things in those conversations because I am very aware of how sensitive of a topic this can be, for example after the first few times I was with my ex she asked me for tips on hj so I explained how I masturbated and it was very clear she really wasn’t paying any attention and when I asked if she was she stared blankly at me and said I was just overthinking it but would then get upset at me when I didn’t cum despite blatantly ignoring the times I told her what I wanted. But I’m the asshole ok Why is it so hard for some of you to believe that in these conversations I’ve come across women who have proven to be very immature? I’ve seen multiple examples of women noting similar reactions from men whenever men have had their egos bruised from a woman simply explaining what they like and this isn’t met with any of the same negative reactions I’ve gotten.I just want to have good sex and I’m not stupid enough to believe being an insulting ass but is the way to go about it and at the same time I don’t understand how I’m being painted as an asshole when I’ve mentioned I frequently feel like I’m not being listened to or have my needs taken into account no matter how hard I try to voice this my god.  Seriously how is me wanting to have a handjob that doesn’t feel like she’s trying to crush my dick or a bj that isn’t toothy an unrealistic expectation or make me entitled? Really proving the point that you can’t voice these opinions about women without getting attacked. Embarrassing","Sure, lots of women are bad in bed. But men are more likely to be able to use them as Fleshlights to get off anyway, while women are much less likely to be able to get off with a partner who's bad in bed.  Some women probably get upset when corrected because they have been told their whole lives that men desperately want to fuck them, so they think that just existing should be enough. If someone tells them something different, they might be really hurt because they've absorbed the notion that all men want to fuck pretty much all women, so if they can't even do THAT right, there must be something terribly wrong with them.",2636
nm0g6h,"when i broke up with my ex, i hung out with my best friend CONSTANTLY. i found myself growing more and more fond of him until i started to imagine us doing things that people who have transcended bestieship do and then i was very tense ALL THE TIME.  he's been my bff for three years and he has had a crush on me ever since he met me. i find this to be so unbelievably hot. just the idea that he has always wanted me and had to wait YEARS for me and now he finally gets to have me. and i get to see this whole other side of him that i've never seen in the three years we were close.  whenever i'm on top of him i just remember that we used to drive in the car together or watch movies and laugh together as best friends and now i get to watch that same smiling face while i ride him and pleasure him and it turns me on so much. EDIT: some of these comments are just so tragic. i did not know he had feelings for me until he confessed a few months ago. i did not immediately get with him after my breakup, we started dating many months after i became single.","You have the best thing ever!  I'm pretty close to that in my marriage. My (63m) wife (66f) and I were friends and colleagues for several years while married to other people, Then she got a divorce, and then I got a divorce.

She's Jewish, born and raised in New York; I'm a decidedly lapsed Episcopalian, grew up in a small town on the West coast. But we're both artists, albeit in vastly different styles, and we see eye to eye politically. I think the thing that keeps our relationship interesting is this vast difference in background. Neither of us has the slightest idea what the other is going to say a lot of the time, and it fascinates us both. And yet, we're one another's biggest fans. And we both like to fuck, a lot. So yeah, you have a great thing going there. Fall in love with your best friend, and always stay friends first.",884
nm7eyh,"I always seem to find the men that say they don’t do oral on a lady. Like they have a strict rule about it and they just never do it. They swear it’s not because they are chauvinistic, it’s their culture or they just have an aversion and they feel It should just be seen as a preference and met with understanding. Yet the older I get the more of a turn off it is to me. I don’t even need it so much as the thought of a man being totally unwilling is a major turn off. I can’t help but feel like these men are jerks and just don’t realize it. I am really disappointed as I think I just ended a potential relationship I was excited about until the moment I found out he “didn’t do that!” Am I alone? Do I need to get over it? Am I wrong for judging these men so harshly? Honestly I think I might rather be single than deal with a man who doesn’t go down as a strict rule.","You are *not* wrong for having a sexual deal breaker. It's fine. Better to find someone compatible than build resentment.

Whenever I ask her if she wants to do try giving me oral this time, she always says she is too tired or some other excuse.

nobqf5,"19F (age isn't relevant for this post but everybody seems to be putting it in) So basically the title. I broke up with my long time bf and decided to get into the casual sex action for the first time.  I hooked  up with a guy, we were going on for an hour (color me impressed). Then he asked me if I'm into bondage. I've never done it but I wanted to try, it was a fun experience. He tied me up, we did some kinky stuff..... that's it. Next week I contact him to maybe meet up again and he said he isn't comfortable with - ""sluts who do everything in bed."" Then he blocked me GUESS WHAT??? That isn't fucking it The next dude with whom I had a casual encounter asked if I was into anal, MID SEX. I hadn't cleaned up for it but he said that he wasn't grossed by some poop. So I did anal with him. I enjoy doing it and he asked me, so why shouldn't I. Next time we talk, he decides to stop things since: ""You're way too comfortable with sexual stuff."" WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? First off are men like these a common trend and secondly what was the thought process behind slut shaming me when they also did the same things???","You seem to be drawing your dates from a pool of idiots. My general advice would be to tighten up on the vetting process, lengthen the timeframe between starting to chat with them, and getting naked with them.  This  isn't meant as some sort of outward demonstration of modesty, but rather as an extended opportunity for them to talk themselves into or out of your pants. Ask them questions that push a bit beyond what they volunteer or boast about in an effort to sleep with you.  How freaky do they like it?  How freaky was the freakiest girl they've been with?  How and why did things end?   It's not a perfect screen, but I suspect that some guys will out themselves as unfuckworthy based on what they might let slip while talking about past encounters.",2213
nq9au0,"I like porn. I like consuming sexual content. I have even been known to pay for the privilege a few times and I have no shame in admitting that.  I’m so tired of silent men. I have to slog through dozens, if not hundreds of videos to find a man making any type of noise. I have to specifically search for men moaning, making noise. Even then its mostly solo male masturbation, and its all heavy breathing, “fuck”, and dirty talking. No. I want to watch sexual content with a partner, where the man is moaning, groaning, growling, purring, whimpering, ALL OF IT. I want to hear how good their mouth/vagina/anus feels, watch his hands grip the sheets/chair/hair/hips, i want to see them ENJOYING sex. But 97% of the time the men are sitting there, silent as a mime, w a little heavy breathing, and if you can see their face, which is rare, he looks bored. And yes, I’ve tried porn specifically created and directed for women, its still not great. I tried gay male porn, but as a cishet woman i wasnt interested. The last straw for me that caused me to create this post was a man on twitter that i follow who occasionally posts sexual content. He let me know he had a video of him nutting (solo) and i asked if i could have it, he said yes. But first, i SPECIFICALLY asked him if he was making noise or if he was just sitting there in silence. He said there was noise. Whelp, i was bamboozled. It was one half moan/half sigh, and then the nut was in slow mo with no sound. I got no preparation, no buildup, just one half moan and then a slow mo nut. This is why i pay for porn. But its so hard to find porn that actually has what i want bc even when it claims to be “for women”, it still uses all the same tricks and methods of porn made for cishet men.

nr9ygt,"Last night my gf and I were being our silly selves by making fun of the way the other one fucks. It was harmless humour. Nothing emotionally damaging. We were just goofing around to see who would laugh first. Both of us were in bed at the time, which was the perfect setting for us to act out some of the things the other one did during sex. I pretended to be my gf in the doggy position. I was biting my bottom lip and seductively looking over my shoulder while trying my best to balance an expression of extreme pain and intense pleasure, on top of moaning loudly and not to mention all the dirty talk that ended with the word ""daddy"".  My gf playfully hit me over the head with a pillow and denied being that over the top. I was still on my hands and knees when she jumped on my back in retaliation and forced me onto my stomach. At that moment she pretended to be me and proceeded to hump my butt relentlessly. I didn't break character though. All my moans and movements were based on how my gf usually behaved in bed, down to the dirty talk. I'm not proud, not even as a joke, of how many times I said ""harder, daddy"" out loud. My gf was the over the top Alpha version of me. Making sounds like she's struggling to poop and slapping butts like she means business.  Not gonna lie, eventually the lines between teasing each other for laughs and enjoying it sexually became somewhat blurry. My gf got so into it, she actually pulled down my boxers and humped my bare ass. She even pushed my head back down when I looked over my shoulder to make eye contact. It wasn't long before I could feel how wet she was while grinding against me. She fucked me like that for about 20 minutes before our dog barged into the bedroom and threw up two dead butterflies that were somehow still intact. Needless to say that killed the mood.  This morning my gf said she had no idea what happened last night. I shrugged and said neither did I. And that was literally how far we got before changing the subject. I can't just leave it like that though. I'm planning to continue the conversation when the time is right, but I don't even know where to start. Did my gf and I just unlock some kind of kink we were unaware of? There's no doubt in my mind that my gf got turned on, but how does she get pleasure out of just humping my ass? Is it possible for some women to orgasm from humping alone? What can I do to better prepare us to get the most of an experience like this? If these questions sound like they're coming from an inexperienced guy, that's because they are. First gf. First relationship. Even first kink now, I think.","Ok... you don't have to launch straight into anal pegging like others have suggested, jesus.

nrufvf,"I (35F) live in a small 2 bedroom house with my fiancé(35M). Last year my mom(67F) retired and due to financial reasons plus covid she moved in with us and is now set up in the  bedroom next to us. The first three months of her living here there wasn’t much sex going on with my fiancé and I because he was away for large chunks of time for work so our sex life was mostly phone and video calls. Since he’s been home we’ve been at it quite often but we don’t feel particularly comfortable having loud sessions anymore because of my mom being in the next room. In an effort dilute our sex sessions I bought my mom a sound machine for her room for sleep, which she really loved and started using right away. We thought this was great, she’d get to drown out our sex noise and we don’t have to be so quiet. However I noticed on a now handful of occasions we would go to bed, I could hear my moms sound machine on, I’d think “great it’s GO time!”  and fiancé and I would have sex. Afterwards I would get up to use the washroom and I would notice her sound machine was turned off. The first time I didn’t think much of it, nor the second, but now it’s been every time we’ve had sex and I would get up to use the washroom even when I didn’t need to just to check and sure enough the sound machine would be off. This past week my fiancé and I were having an afternoon session, my mom was in the living room watching her show quite loudly so we figured nothing was heard. Sure enough I walk out and the tv is muted and she’s laying in the couch fiddling with her phone. Now today, just hours ago fiancé and I are again having sex in our bedroom, this time being quiet but this house has paper thin walls so unless there is something to drown out sound it surely can be heard to an extent. We finish and my fiancé jumps out of bed in desperate need of water, throws his pants on and when he opens the door there my mom is hovering against the door.  This is making both of us uncomfortable. I am unsure how to address this with her or if I should at all? Does anyone have some advice on what to say or how to approach this. I’m certain this is what she is doing however I could be wrong and I don’t want to make our living situation awkward.  Her and I are not open about sex and she is quite prudish herself. What to do?  TLDR: My mom has been turning off her sound machine at night when fiancé and I have sex and I’ve caught her outside my door while we were having sex as well. This is making us uncomfortable and need advice on how to approach this with her.",Use the sound machine yourself,3373
nv1y6g,"So I have had like 2 partners till now and I am only 21. I met this guy today (M25) at his hotel room. First of all, he straight away started kissing me, we don't even know eachother better, just texted for 2 days. I wanted to get comfortable by talking first but he jumped into it so I didn't say anything. I had told him on text that I need time to get comfortable. Then we undressed and he has a fetish for armpits. He bit my armpits so hard, it's still painful. He even shoved my face in his armpit without asking me. When he was going to penetrate me it was painful as I wasn't wet enough, when I asked him for an oral again, he got kind of angry and said I just gave you an oral for 10 minutes (it wasn't 10 minutes).  So I said okay then let's do it, but he kept losing his erection after that and told me I am completely different from what I am on text and that I shouldn't go for hookups if takes me time to get wet. I have hooked up with a guy before and it was amazing, this time I just couldn't, I needed more work. I don't know how to feel. This guy made me feel like it's all my fault and I killed his mood so he couldn't get an erection again. I want to know what others think about this. Please tell me. Edit: his bumble account got reported too a bunch of times, now I know why I guess. Edit: why is this getting downvoted? Edit: I have realised I wasn't at fault at all, I deserve pleasure too and I made this guy cum thrice. I am done with assholes who cannot be bothered with others pleasure. Thank you so much for your comments and messages, I needed them.","This ""experienced"" guy clearly isn't as experienced as he made out to be.
