f0rf9a,"On my recent travel, I met your typical late 20-somethings couple who proudly declared that they left behind their desk jobs to do this, and wondered why everyone else seems miserable.  I was a bit annoyed at the condescending tone, as I told them that my vacation is ending soon and I have to go back to work the day after I land home. We can’t all afford to leave our jobs as and when we please. We, the miserable 9-5 people, keep the economy going so people like you you can afford to do this whimsy take after the wind travel you so desire. I used to work in hospitality and received an average of 20 emails a day from travel bloggers who wants a stay for free in exchange of a shitty blog and Instagram post. I usually read their ‘about’ page and they’re ALL the same - they left their deskbound job la la la, they want to see the world la la la. Like I too travel and see the world AND get to keep my day job. What makes you special??  Don’t look down on the 9-5 folks and assume we are all miserable. I keep this steady job because it allows me to be wild and fancy outside of it.","That’s interesting.  I recently left my job to travel the world for a year, and I consider myself extraordinarily lucky to be able to do so.  I have no kids or pets, no mortgage, not especially close to my family... When I got an unexpected payout for leaving my job, I put my things in storage and left.  I don’t look down at all on my friends with 9-5 jobs and in fact, I often wonder wtf I have done. Lol.   I’ve encountered some of the professional travelers and bloggers who do seem to have the mentality you’re speaking of.  (“I think everyone should...” blah blah blah), but I avoid them.  They  usually come off as young, spoilt, and immature (in my experience).  I totally get why most people wouldn’t not even *want* to drop everything and leave.  It wouldn’t be feasible for most of my friends either because they have kids and other responsibilities, which are far more important than travel.  TBH, I know some people back home judge me for doing it, but as someone mentioned already, it’s a trade off.  Everyone has to do what’s right for them, and it’s ridiculous to judge someone whose shoes you’ve never walked in.   Sorry you’ve had that judgmental experience with long-term travelers.  We definitely don’t all share that ignorant opinion of which you speak.",2618
