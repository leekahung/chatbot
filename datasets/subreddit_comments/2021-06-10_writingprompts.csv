4vv4o7,Did NOT expect this amount of replies. Thanks guys! It'll be an interesting read.,"""Ya know what drives me FUCKIN' wild bro?"" slurs a purring drawl from John's left. John jumps, alarmed, and looks about his room, seeing nothing but a lump catapulting to his lap in a slump of warmth and weight. ""Is' that we got ALL these...hmmph"" the mass stretches, barring teeth in a relaxed smile, ""all these MOUSES, but you don't like a one of 'em."" John looks down, perplexed. ""Otto?"" ""Iss' like you don care NOTHIN' bout your health, ya know? Now I know you aren't, you know, bright or nothin', but I don't get how you can just be such a big uncaring FUCK when I go out'n do somethin nice for you. Like, okay. You need to eat, right?"" ""Uh, Otto?!"" ""Nono John, is okay, I know you do. You need to eat, so I bring ya food. Good food, some fuckin mouses, I mean who the fuck don't like mouses? But with you is fuckin' all 'naaaaaah man, fuck you, I wanna fuckin' starve and not be strong or no shit like that.' The fuck is up with it, bro?"" ""You're talking!"" Otto looks around, eyes slightly wider. ""Yeah, I guess ya right... I am talkin'. Shiiiiit, bro..."" Otto's head slumps back, ""I all up n' forgot we weren't supposed to do that."" He sulks for a moment, not saying anything for a long time. ""Eh..."" he finally says. ""Guess the cat's out of the bag, no?"" ""What the fuck? Have you always been able to talk?"" John inquires. ""I dunno, John, have I always not had testicles?"" John says nothing to this. Otto suddenly turns serious. ""I was born with a large, barbed, cock, John, and you took tha' joy from me. This is why every time you rub my beautiful, fluffy belly, ya get bitted. This is why I stand at the door like I wanna go out, but then when its open, I just go back inside. This is why I poisoned your mother on that rainy night in Topeka."" John stands there, shocked as his former feline friend rains bombs of truth upon him. ""I had a gift, John, and I will never, ever forgive you."" Upon uttering this phrase, Otto stumbles clumsily from the bed, bumping the door on his way out. ""I have to go, now. The Agency should be here any minute."" ""Will... Will I ever see you again?"" Otto turns, a slight smile on his lips. ""In hell, John. In hell."" --- (I'm glad people seem to be liking this!

5dkh21,"I am so excited about this! Two years ago, I started writing short stories here on /r/WritingPrompts. And the fourth prompt that I ever responded to was: [The Roman Empire never collapsed and the year is 1999 AD](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2kx5e9/wp_the_roman_empire_never_collapsed_and_the_year/). I enjoyed writing it so much that I soon followed it up with a Part II. Then I just kept writing and writing until it turned into a 90,000 word novel: Rex Electi! [The book is available on Amazon here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N03B1AJ) and, if you have a different e-reader, there are PDF and ePub versions [available here](https://gumroad.com/l/htCH). It's $2.99 through both sites. Here's the blurb: > Caius Serica, a pilot in the Roman military in the year 1999, is whisked away from his camp in the middle of the night under mysterious circumstances. He soon learns that every aspect of his life so far, including the staged deaths of his parents, has been arranged by the Senate Tribunal in an attempt to mold him into the perfect leader. Now there are only thirty candidates, including Caius, left competing to be the Emperor's heir. Success in a series of trials will reunite him with his family and make him the most powerful man in the world, but failure will lead to a life of isolation and imprisonment. As Caius enters the trials, it becomes apparent that the tests themselves are not the problem: it is the twenty nine other candidates willing to do whatever it takes to win, including maim or kill their top competitors. Can Caius navigate the pitfalls of imperial politics and cutthroat competition, all while performing well enough to succeed in the trials fair and square? I'm also *thrilled* to have a physical copy of it! [Just look at how awesome this is!](http://imgur.com/a/wGUBX) I am so pleased to be able to have a copy to put up on my bookshelf (well, actually I am going to frame mine but you probably wouldn't do that). If you would also like a physical copy, you can [get a copy here through Createspace](https://www.createspace.com/6709876)! Physical copies are $8.89, but well worth it! I just want to thank everyone in the /r/WritingPrompts community. This is my first novel (I also have an ebook collection [available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/comments/3jhk4n/i_published_an_ebook_its_called_prompt_me_you/) but that doesn't really count), and it just feels like I am finally taking a step that I have *always* wanted to take.

5m4mgd,Inspired by comments in r/art,"The latest episode was starting. Mark sat at the television, watching, waiting. Bob came on screen, like he always did. The smile he gave the world once seemed carefree and kindly to him, but Mark could now only see the inner smugness in his teeth, the way his eyes shifted around in their sockets, the glee of somebody getting away with murder. It had occurred to Mark that he may have gone mad. But therapy could wait. He was onto something. He knew it. “Hello, and welcome to another episode of The Joy of Painting. Now today we're going to try something a little different, but don't worry -” Mark sneered to himself at the line, eyes darting over to the walls of his home. They were covered in photographs, pictures from the show, some from behind the scenes. Police reports were stacked on his desk, missing person reports to be exact. Hundreds of interviews from terrified parents and concerned spouses, looking for their family and friends, desperately hoping for any update, unaware that they would never see them again. Because of *Him*. Bob was applying the first few strokes to the canvas, but Mark was lost in thought, lost in his hatred for the smug murderer on screen. The nice-guy persona didn't faze him a bit nowadays. He had initially made the connection by accident. A photograph of the crime scene was featured in the daily paper, and Mark had the feeling he'd seen it before. And just like that, a side-by-side comparison made it obvious. Bob had painted the scene of the crime, down to the individual trees. And he'd painted it on television. On television, in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers. He turned his attention back to the screen. Bob was working on the foreground, carefully applying a shade of dark green. Any beauty the image might have once held was gone. Instead, a single question remained. Who was buried there? Mark didn't realize it until the episode was almost done. Bob was meticulously placing the branches on a single tree in the background, a strange tree that was split down the middle. With a start, Mark got to his feet and ran to the window, looking out at his backyard. And in his backyard was a single tree, split down the middle. Bob's voice spoke from the television in the living room: “Well, that's it for this episode. I made this painting for a dear friend that I haven't seen in a while. It's gonna be so great to give it to him in person.”",3563
5pi8t0,"So I wrote this story a while back in response to the really popular prompt about [soulmates and complementary superpowers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3o7rtq/wp_everybody_in_the_world_has_a_superpower_that/) I'd like to pick up on my writing in the new year and maybe some feedback will inspire me to post what I write more. EDIT: Wow! I never thought I'd get so big a response. I'm glad so many people liked it!  EDIT 2: Oh my! A legitimate gilding! Thank you so much kind stranger! EDIT 3: You guys are awesome. I've officially set up a subreddit. Link at the bottom of the story.  ***** I would’ve settled for a boring superpower. 20/20 vision. Perfect pitch. The ability to draw a perfect circle 100% of the time. Or no power at all even. No-shows actually get non-ability checks from the government now since they passed that law six months ago. No powers would have been better than what I wound up with. I walk into the diner at 8:45. The last rays of the sinking sun temporarily warming the chill evening air. I usually go out as late as possible to minimize the number of people I run into. At this hour, there are only three patrons: a middle aged man sitting at the counter and a couple at a booth. A pair of bells above the door ring as it shuts behind me.  “Come on in, have a seat!” I hear someone call out from the kitchen. “Be right with ya!” I take a seat at the far end of the restaurant. It’s been five years since I discovered what my power was. It possibly started to manifest sooner but there’s no way of telling when. Most people get them in their teens, around puberty. Some kids take to their powers immediately, some develop them slowly over time. Some are late bloomers, and a rare few just never get any.  Just like with puberty, it can be an awkward time. A friend of mine found out she could fly when she shot over the school on track and field day. Another kid I knew hit a baseball into orbit at a little league game. Destroyed a $70,000 solar panel on the ISS. That one made the news. You learn to control it more or less, but nobody really gets a hang of their powers until they meet the one. The scientists don’t know how to explain it, but they think it’s a hormonal thing. They still don’t know if it’s the relationship that stabilizes the powers or the sudden improvement or amplification of both powers that solidifies the bond. But my friend found a guy who could control air currents. Turns out he could never generate enough lift to take off, but together she can lift him and he can whisk them along. They’ve been married for two years now. The guy with super strength kept hurting himself from constantly breaking things with his ability. During one of his extended stays at the hospital, he met a girl there for much the same reason. They knew it was a match made in heaven when they shook hands and didn’t crush each other’s fingers. Together, along with therapy and practice, I hear they’ve stopped tearing doors off hinges and breaking down walls. I’m brought out of my reminiscing when I hear the couple across the room laughing merrily. There’s a spoon levitating between them. It dips into a dessert on the plate and floats gently over to girl and she takes a bite. They both laugh. He keeps saying things like “so what about this…” and “or how about…” Every time he pauses she giggles again, as if he’s just told a joke. I try not to think about it, but deep down, I secretly know the worst thing about my ability is that I’ll never find someone who I could be with. Just then, the waitress zips out from the kitchen. I say zips because she’s moving almost too fast to track. She busses a table in one corner of the room, gives the man at the counter his bill, and refills the couple’s coffee cups in ten seconds flat. By the time I register that she’s on her way towards me, it’s too late to call out. As soon as she gets within two meters of me, she immediately decelerates to a regular pace. Her shoes skid on the linoleum tiles and she goes sprawling to the ground in front of me with a loud grunt that sounds more surprised than hurt. The menu she was holding flies across the room. Everyone turns to look, startled. I flinch. “Sally? Is everything okay?” I see a cook poke his head out of the kitchen. “What the hell happened?!” I was out of my seat and helping her up about two seconds after she hit the floor. The man from the counter comes over with the cook. “Ah… I’m alright Harry. I-I guess I tripped.” She winces as she gets to her feet. The skin on her knees and palms is badly scraped. “Tripped?” the chef grunts. “Two years you been workin’ here and I ain’t never even seen you drop a spoon. You feeling alright hon?” The waitress, Sally, nods. “Jesus Sal, look at your hands!” The man from the counter clears his throat. “I believe I can help with that miss. I’m a doctor.” “Oh it’s nothing a little iodine and some bandages wouldn’t fix doc, don’t worry about it.” The doctor smiles. “Why don’t I just show you?” He takes her hands gently in his and… nothing happens. He turns his palms over, looking confused. “I don’t understand… there’s usually a slight glow… the wounds should be healing…” He seems understandably troubled. The waitress gives a little gasp. “So it’s not just me… just before I fell, I think… I think my powers just… stopped working.” She gingerly rubs her wrist. “What about you Harry?” The cook thrusts a hand out. Nothing happens. He tries again. Still nothing. “What in the hell… mine was working just a minute ago… this is weird.” He turns to me. “How about you buddy?” All this time I’ve been shrinking back, my face feeling hot. Now I can’t bring myself to meet their gazes. “Uh… my powers are working just fine, actually…” This is met with confused stares from the other two, but the doctor’s eyes light up. “Ah I see. You’re a null, aren’t you?” I grimace at the term. From across the room, the spoon floating between the two lovebirds clatters noisily to the table. I grit my teeth. This hasn’t gone unnoticed by the doctor, who looks at the young couple and then back to me. My ears are burning now. I know I’ve technically done nothing wrong, but in a society where not having a superpower is considered a disability, taking them away might as well be a criminal act. Harry the chef scratches his chin thoughtfully. “I ain’t never heard of that kinda’ power…” “I’m really sorry miss” but she shakes her head. “It’s not like you did it on purpose, hey? I guess I ought to be more careful sometimes.” “What’s the range of your, ah, talent?” the doctor asks.  “I can usually keep it to about two or three meters…” His eyes dart to the couple and back. “I should probably go… I’m sorry.” “Naw, naw, kid, sit down. This I gotta see,” the cook says with a grin. That’s because it wasn’t a paramedic trying to heal a near-fatal injury or a firefighter trying to lift a broken beam off someone this time. I take a deep breath and sit down. Closing my eyes, I go over the steps like I have a thousand times before. The chef takes a step back, then another. Suddenly, a little flame puffs into life in the middle of his palm. He chuckles. The doctor gently leads the waitress away. A soft white glow shines from his hands. The waitress straightens up. There’s not a scratch on her anymore. “Wow Doc! The pain’s all gone too!” In the blink of an eye she retrieves the discarded menu and zooms back, coming to a careful stop before she gets too close. She walks towards me with exaggerated steps and hands it over. “No harm, no foul?” She smiles politely. The chef claps me on the shoulder and walks away. The doctor gives me a meaningful smile, tinged with pity. “Uh… thanks…” With the show over Sally the supersonic waitress takes my order and then whips across the room to the couple. I can’t hear what they’re saying, but at one point or another each looks at me. The familiar feeling settles over me. That’s what it’s like, having my power. I couldn’t repel people any more if I had wound up with magnetism instead. Sally whips up with a pot of coffee and a mug, again coming to a halt before walking towards me, pouring and walking away. The bell at the door jangles again. A young woman enters. I keep my eyes on the steam rising from the mug.  “Take a seat hon, I’ll be right with ya.” The woman quickly finds a seat by the back, walking between tables. Sally, already back to her old rhythm it seems, goes zooming around to greet the new customer. She procures another cup and speeds over. What happens next only takes moments. In short order, the waitress roughly bumps into the table instead of stopping, fumbling with the pot and accidentally splashing coffee. The woman cries out and Sally immediately apologizes. Without thinking, she sets the pot down and bolts away to get a napkin—shooting right past the counter at twice the usual speed. She careens into a wall with a thwack that sounds significantly more painful than embarrassing and flops onto her back, out cold. There are a few seconds of stunned silence. Harry pokes his head out from the kitchen: “Again Sal? How many times are—” he trails off when he sees her unmoving on the floor. “Jesus Christ! Sally!” The doctor is already by her side, hands glowing. He stops the chef before he can exit from behind the counter. “You need to call an ambulance. Right now. This is beyond my talent to fix alone.” He turns back to the unconscious waitress, face grim. A big gash has opened up on her forehead. “What the hell happened!?”  “Oh God… I—I’m so sorry…” The woman who walked in is now on her feet, face white as a sheet, hands clasped in front of her mouth. A loud pinging sound interrupts before she can say another word. I turn in the direction of the young couple, who are both sitting mouth agape, staring at the same unfortunate spoon, now embedded in the far wall. Then the girl cries out. “Jane!” This is her date, leaping across to see if she’s okay. The doctor strains his neck trying to see what’s going on. “I’m so sorry, I don’t know what happened, the spoon, it just—I never…” but she’s not listening. She doesn’t appear hurt. Not physically. Still, she puts her hands over her ears and shrieks. “Rich, oh God Rich, make it stop! It’s too loud! Too many voices!” The girl collapses out of her seat curling into a ball on the floor. “Make it stop!” she pleads. “Please make it stop!” The boy doesn’t know what to do. He’s rubbing her back, trying to help. Silverware, dishes, table settings, all around the diner are starting to rattle. “What the HELL IS GOING ON?!” Harry shouts above the din. Things devolve quickly after that. The glow from the doctor’s hands explodes into a brilliant whiteness. Sally’s eyes snap open and she arches her back with a loud gasp.  “How…?” that doctor’s eyes widen in alarm. Simultaneously, both of Harry’s hands erupt in flames.  “GAH FUCK!” The bewildered chef starts waving them around wildly, his sleeves catching fire. The girl Jane is still keening on the floor. Rich is crouched by her side, a maelstrom of utensils and tableware starts whirling around the room. Through it all, the young woman is still standing, frozen. Tears of fear and horror pouring down her cheeks. A look I’ve never seen on someone else. Then it clicks. I stand up and walk over through all the chaos, until I’m right beside her. I put my hand on her shoulder and turn her to face me. She meets my gaze. Something in my eyes must be speaking to her too, and that’s when I know for sure. I wrap my arms around her and pull her close. She’s soft and small and smells like lavender. I feel hot tears soaking through my shirt. “It’s okay,” I say. “Everything is going to be okay.” Everything stops, all at once. All the dishes fall to the floor. The blinding light from the doctor’s hands disappears. Harry’s firearms sputter and go out. The room is silent, except for a few whimpers coming from Jane, and the muffled sobbing coming from the woman in my arms.  The doctor tends to everyone in short order. Sally was fine the moment the flash hit. He says he never had results that fast, even with his partner right next to him. Harry has some light burns, but the doc takes care of those. Besides needing a new shirt and having no more hair on his arms, he’s fine. He grumbles about closing early tonight. Sally agrees. Rich had a cut above the eye where an errant saucer clipped him, and Jane had a small headache, but both are no worse for wear. He approaches me wordlessly. There’s a small gash on my forearm I didn’t notice in all the confusion. He holds out his hand to heal it. I start to protest, but before I can say anything, the warm glow appears around his fingers. My arm tingles for a moment and when he pulls away, I see my cut is gone. I’m flabbergasted, but the doctor smiles knowingly. He gives me a nod and a wink and walks away. I turn my attention to the woman. My soul mate, I realize, and I don’t even know her name yet. I loosen my embrace and she pulls her head away, but her arms are still tightly wrapped around me, and mine around her. She looks blurry. I blink and wipe at my eyes. Her face is red and raw and beautiful. Messy hair and cheeks shiny with tears. The red rimming her eyes makes the blue inside them pop.  “Hi” I say. She laughs. A low, soft giggle. I can’t help but laugh a little too. “Hi.” She buries her face in my chest and says something else, but I can’t make it out.  “What was that?” I ask. “Don’t let go,” she repeats, softly. “Don’t ever let go.” “I won’t. I promise.” ***** Come visit the newly minted /r/IrateCanadien if you want! ",WOW. That was really good I'd love to read a whole series of these.,2661

You know who you are :)","Sir Mittens walked, on his back two paws, out of the castle’s gates. A long, red cape flowed past a soft, furry body. A steel helmet sat atop his head. Two soft ears poked out of holes in the helmet. A sword rattled against his hips. A great chorus of cheers and salutations followed Sir Mittens as he walked out of the castle. He strode, proud, into the thick forest which ringed the castle. The King and his court watched from balconies up high. Pride swelled in their chests. The forest came up to meet Sir Mittens. The dense overgrowth soon surrounded the noble kitten. The cheers of the castle died down as the thicket grew ever denser around Sir Mittens. The brave kitty was soon surrounded by the peaceful quiet of the forest. Birds chirped, leaves rustled, insects cricked and frogs croaked. A soft stream babbled somewhere nearby. The ground beneath Sir Mittens soft, pink paws started to slope upwards. With an adorable, and very scratchable chin held high, Sir Mittens walked. The slope broke out of the dense forest, and Sir Mittens ascended the incline. The slope left behind the thick green of the forest. Sir Mittens was quickly surrounded by rocky mountains and spires. He climbed, agile and patient, up the mountain. Above him, a great cavern was carved into the mountainside. Sir Mittens saw the mouth of the cave, and narrowed his eyes. His paws moved expertly as he traversed the rocky slope. His goal was in sight. Reaching a pink paw up in the air, Sir Mittens grabbed the lip of the cave. He pulled himself up, and soon stood at the edge of this mountain cavern. The midday sun beat into the cave, illuminating it. Just on the edge of his vision, Sir Mittens could see glittering piles of gold and treasure. Sir Mittens took several careful steps into the cave. His tail swished softly behind him as he stalked forward. From within the cave, Sir Mittens could hear a breathing. A great, hot gust of air blew past Sir Mittens. Suddenly, the ground started to shake beneath Sir Mittens’ paws. Deep within the cave, there was a tremendous rustling. Sir Mittens spread his hind legs out, and readied himself. He felt the impact of massive, taloned feet approaching him from within the dark. A great, scaly head appeared before Sir Mittens. A giant bearded dragon, easily towering over Sir Mittens’ feline form, emerged from the depths of the cave. It stood in front of Sir Mittens, and let out a great roar. Sir Mittens stared up at the bearded dragon. The two creatures locked eyes. A smile spread across the bearded dragon’s reptilian face. The great lizard laid on its belly, and extended its head out towards Sir Mittens. Sir Mittens padded towards the lizard, and raised a paw. With the softest of pats, Sir Mittens petted the giant bearded dragon. The bearded dragon purred softly. “King Meow sends me, Sir Mittens, to give you a message, Oh Great One.” Sir Mittens said softly to the lizard. The bearded dragon continued to purr contentedly as Sir Mittens’ continued to pet its head. Sir Mittens leaned his head in towards the lizard’s ear. He was so close that some of his whiskers touched the reptile’s scales. He whispered quietly. “The King says you’re a good boy/“ The bearded dragon let out a satisfied purr, and Sir Mittens wrapped his soft arms around the dragon’s neck, embracing the great beast in an act of friendship and loving respect. -------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed the story!

5w4x14,"Apostles... Dang it, I meant Apostles.","Quick note to OP, I think you meant to say Apostles. Jesus had many more disciples than 12. _____ **The Book of Rad** Rad 2:1 On the fifth week day a bachelor party took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus had been invited, along with a plus one. So Jesus brought his apostle Chad as his plus one, and Brad as Chad's plus one's plus one. Chad scoped out the joint before turning to Jesus and saying to him, ""JC, my man. There is nowhere near enough wine here for all of these people to get plastered."" ""So be it,"" Jesus replied. ""Bring me the barrels of wine."" Brad and Chad began to lift the barrels before turning to Jesus once more. ""JC, could you just come over here? It would be a lot easier. These are heavier than a man-eating whale!"" So Jesus approached the barrels of wine and blessed them. Chad filled a chalice from the barrel and took a sip. Chad sung with joy, ""Hard liquor! The Lord has blessed us with hard liquor!""

What better way to remain undetected than to leave the place better than I found it? Sure, that usually means sweeping up my footsteps, and if one floor is cleaner than the other, now that's just suspicious. Gotta sweep the whole house, no doubt. And you can't be having squeaky doors, that's just unprofessional. Even saw a little kid once, out cold on the couch one winter night - couldn't have him wake up and rat me out, right? So I carried him to his bed, made sure to tuck him in as well. Gotta make sure he don't wake up. O'course, I started tucking in all the folks I found after that. Just became a habit, really. Don't even get me started on the garages. Far too many tools to accidently kick in the darkness, get myself caught - and once you've cleaned the garage, you might as well do a couple more rooms, right? Can't have it looking out of place. And all these houses, they're really just a couple rooms, no more. Usually less. You know, before, I'd usually just take a bit of money, maybe something valuable that wouldn't be missed. All the other towns, folks could afford it.  But this town, the poverty all around... No, I'll just take a bit of food if there's extra, maybe an old shirt if mine's starting to show through.  Really, I've managed to buy a few odds and ends, sneaking in a couple things it looks like they need. These people have so little - and a little more always helps, I guess. Strange enough, I don't really need to look for anything I need no more. Every house I go to, there's something out in the open, waiting for me. A home cooked meal. An old pair of shoes. Even a knitted jersey, bit too small, but it just felt like it was made *for* me, you know?  I don't know. The state they live in, I don't know what they'd do without me.

The pink, bipedal alien prostrated itself longer and deeper than was strictly necessary; but Da!'kzor had long learnt his kind did so out of respect to his race's traditions and not as a form of veiled insult. ""These humans are so much friendlier than those obnoxious Alpha Centaurianeese"", he thaught to himself. ""Rise Human"", his speaker said.  ""His majesty, the Emperor Da!'kzor, the eternal light, the defender of the Pascor Belt, the flame of..."" the speaker droned on for quite some time listing all of Da!'kzor's titles, so he stopped listening for a few minutes ""... the forger of chains and progenitor of all will receive you now.""  Now the emissary presented the traditional gifts of his people: A bottle of that dark and sweet liquid his thirty first wife liked so much and a box of sticky round... things with a hole in the middle.   ""Honored Emissary I hope you have not come to speak to me about this Democracy thing again. Your people seem to fare quite well with it; but I doubt it would work in the eternal court. Just imagine, the nobles having a say in the government"" Da!'kzor suppressed a disgusted shudder. ""No you eternal highness"", the human said. ""I am here for a matter of grave importance"" ""Oh, is it about the Water again? If I remember correctly we gave you back all we borrowed from your oceans; and a bit more as compensation for your troubles"" Da!'kzor said with an apologetic voice not-befiting his station. He found it difficult to keep the proper decorum around humans. They were always so... willing to help you just had to be nice to them.  ""About that,..."" the diplomat said with a frown, but then obviously pulled himself together. ""Today I am here for another matter entirely. I am here to request the eternal empire's help"" Now THIS was interesting. Da!'kzor leaned forwards in his throne, one of his tentacles ceasing to caress his favorite concubines eyes. The humans were always willing to help, but had never before, not ever since first contact hundreds of years ago, requested any kind of aid. Hesitantly the human diplomat continued. ""We do not wish to bother the Eternal Empire with politics of earth; however the Felurians have seen fit to declare war upon us. I was sent here to ask, kindly, for the eternal empire to come to our aid in our time of need.""  A few Days later... Earth was a magnificent sight Da!'kzor mused as he studied it from the Earth's Flagship's Observation deck. If the humans weren't such nice fellows he might have conquered it himself.  Finally Earth's Generals entered. The looked like a hard bunch of specimen, old and scarred and with the cold look of warriors in their eyes.  Of them Da!'kzor approved. However he did not approve of the assembled high command of a  hundred other species entering the large room, more a stadium than a room really, entering with them.  ""What are they doing here?"" he snarled, encompassing the assembled military genius of just about all space faring races in the universe with a waving of his central eye socket.  ""You highness,"" a general interjected. ""The eternal Empire is not the only government in the universe to have pledged to help humanity in this hour of need""  From the crowd a snickering could be heard. Doubtlessly that would be Rattak the high Admiral of the Alpha Centaurianeese deep-space navy. His nemesis, his Arch-enemy. The thorn in his side, the bramble in his shoe on his way to universe-domination. He drew himself up to his full height to end er once and for al, but then thought better of it. This was no time for petty quarrels over who controlled what quadrant of the galaxy. The humans needed him, and her to stop the might of the Felurians, and he would stand by their side in their hour of need.  The war was over in fewer days, than it had taken to assemble the great fleet of the grand coalition. Soon the red and white flag of earth flew over the King's palace on Feluria, the government had been reformed and the Felurian people now paid tribute to the earthlings they had so dismissively sought to vanquish. ""Truly a great day"", General Xi Liauging from Beijing, Earth thought. The maple leaf insignia on his uniform caught the light of the burning capital. ""Soon my beloved Canada will hold sway, from one end of the galaxy to another""  --- --- *Holy Canada, what happened here?

Not that we know much about God, of course. There are plenty of books that survived the destruction, though the readers far more sparse. And those that could spouted nonsense after a few pages, about things called Suns and moons being created, about talking beings called ""animals"", about oceans. About legends of old, myths, wishful thinking. But what I do know about God is, if his hand caused the damage to the ship, I don't want to know much more.  The stories say that the ship used to be one before it hit. That the asteroid split the ship right down the center, making the way to the other side dangerous, impossible. But we can still see it, entangled in cord and moving alongside us, and we can see in their windows. We can see the faces far more gaunt than our own, the cheeks near bone, the eyes hollow and staring hungrily back at us. And we can see them fighting, using knives stashed from the kitchen along with strange flashing devices, and though we cannot hear we know they scream.  There is a third part of the ship as well, this one with no faces in the windows, all dark and barely held to the main two parts. But no one has ever seen movement there, and it is far smaller than the halves.  There are one thousand of us on our side, a census conducted each year by scratching marks into the cold wall, making sure we have enough to eat. Any number over eleven hundred has led to shortages of food, and more importantly, water. As one of the gardeners, I know this too well, planning out the ship's rations and crops, utilizing the few rooms remaining with glowing ceilings. Deciding if I plant only those seeds specified for meals, or if we could splurge on space for the herbs demanded by our doctors or the spices requested by our cooks.  We worked together on the ship, each of us with our task for survival, none of us expendable. At ten a child was assigned their task, from chief to scourer, based upon the skills they possessed. Every year they were reevaluated, deciding if a change was neccessary, and for the past three I had been applying for the coveted historian. For keeping the tales and the knowledge from long before, from where the recovered books on ship census marked twenty five thousand.  In the stories of old, it is said that God could speak even if he couldn't be seen. That he could be heard as a voice alone, sending commandments down to his people.  And today, of the year 984, I, Horatius, heard him.  ""Systems rebooting,"" said the voice, jolting me out of my duties watering the plants, ""ship damage assessed. Reuniting the two halves of the ship and restoring airlock, approximately twenty four hours until complete."" Staring out the window, I saw the cables holding the halves of the ships tighten. I saw the eyes of the hungry faces widen as they were dragged closer.  And I wondered if the hand of God was striking again.  *** ### [For only $2.99, you can have your own kindle copy by clicking here!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0711C45FC)   ***  If you don't trust the online reviews, start reading on my blog below and see what you think.

Twelve hours. Twelve hours in this damn room, with Agent Johnson shouting in my face. I took a deep breath and spoke as slowly as possible. ""I. Don't. Know. What. You're. Talking. About."" He swung his fist. I was ready for it, not that it did anything to stop the pain lancing through my vision. ""Do you know the odds of winning the lottery, son?""  I groaned. ""I'm an American citizen. I have rights!"" As he had been for half a day, he ignored me. ""They're one in 300 million, give or take. At least, from the available math. We actually have some little tricks to make the odds even worse, so it comes out to closely one in 700 million."" He leaned in on the desk, his face inches from mine. ""Which means that, statistically, anyone who wins the lottery already knew the results. Statistically, you are a time traveler - and since we started the lotto, every single winner has been a time traveler."" I spat on his face. He leaned back to wipe it off. ""Or you just tortured everyone until they admitted they were a time traveler."" He chuckled at that. ""I see your thought there, but the fact is, every time they've been able to give us some sort of useful future info. All you have to do is give us on useful future fact, and then we'll send you back to your home time - after wiping your memory of the lotto information, of course. Not the torture, not that we sent you back. We want you assholes to know we can detect you, just not how."" I found myself staring at him blankly. ""You can wipe memories?"" He nodded. ""And your shock tells me you're from before the 2500's, since that's where the tech comes from. Sometime jockey thought he could muck about with it. We kept it."" ""Wow. Men in black much?"" Shrug. ""So...one fact, one date, we send you back."" I was tired, I was hungry, I was in pain, and this guy was a psychopath. ""And if I don't give you the information? What then?"" He nodded. ""Good question. Then we shoot you in the head and see what medical advancements we can get out of your body."" The way he said it, so terribly nonchalant...he meant it. He was going to kill me. ""I swear, I'm not from the future."" That got me another punch to the gut. ""I don't believe you. Try again."" I sobbed. ""Fine. Fine. I wasn't going to mess things up...just wanted a better life."" He grinned. ""You all do. And you don't need to say you weren't going to make any major changes - I know you weren't, because you're all so afraid of erasing yourself. I don't care. Intel. Now. ."" I took a deep breath, grateful for the time to think. ""North Korea collapses in 2021. Their nuclear weapons end up on the black market...and one of them gets detonated in LA in 2023. March 15th, to be exact."" There, that sounded plausible enough.  I hoped, at least, as he flipped through some notes. ""Looks like we've got another traveler giving us the same year for North Korea, which confirms your info with ISIS."" I felt my blood run cold. I'd gotten lucky. ""Good, so I don't have to kill you. Let’s get you wiped and back to..."" the last words went up in a question. ""April 23, 2341."" I said, feeling tears welling up behind my eyes.  He nodded again, and rapped the glass. --- When I arrived, I have to admit it was amazing. Everything was in a giant dome, and there was a jungle outside. Inside, buildings floated about like ships on the wind. I got some odd looks - probably because my clothes were 3 centuries out of fashion, opposed to the metallic outfits most people wore.  That was fine. All I had to do was find the local government and tell them I'd been time exiled from the 21st century. Or something. Time travel was real, they had to have some way of proving I was from when I said I was.  I'd get a job, I'd get money. And first chance I got, I'd get back to the twenty-first century with as much future tech as I could. I wasn't a time criminal. I couldn't remember why Agent Johnson thought I was, anymore. Something about statistics. It didn't matter. Because it'd be more accurate to say I hadn't been a time criminal. But that was going to change. I was going to get back to my time, my life...and then I was going to use the tech I brought with me to rain an unholy hell upon him. After all, it was my time. I wasn't going to erase myself by accident. But I was going to erase Agent Johnson. --- More at /r/Hydrael_Writes *wow, this blew up, thanks!

6he4sl,Edit: wow this blew up never expected this to happen. Thanks Reddit !,"The steam from the shining locomotive billowed like cloud across the platform, which was scattered with hundreds of students, new and old, off to Hogwarts for another year. Harry Potter, more than used to the stares, the smiles - the curious, assessing looks - helped his youngest up onto the train and said his farewells. ""Be good, Lily,"" he said. ""And write your mother."" Ginny appeared with the other two and Harry gave them hugs goodbye while their mother loaded them onto the train. He stepped back from the entrance to the carriage--and into the path of a wheeled trolley burdened with a trunk, cauldron, and books wrapped in brown paper and twine. An owl, snowy white, familiar amber eyes, rested in a birdcage atop of the ordered chaos. ""Ooh! I'm sorry,"" squeaked the young girl behind the trolley. ""Not your fault,"" Harry said with an easy smile. ""First year?"" The girl nodded, unable to suppress an excited grin of her own. She beamed from ear to ear, all four feet and change, under a crop of frizzy blonde hair. Harry had seen his own kids, Lily only a year older, look this young, but couldn't imagine himself ever being so small. In the years since the war, the wizarding population in Britain had blossomed. Hogwarts, home to only hundreds of students during Harry's years there, now housed thousands. The castle grew as needed. ""Petunia,"" a low voice said through a cloud of loose steam. ""Mind that trolley, now. I--"" A tall man emerged through the cloud, a gentle hand coming to rest on the young girl's--Petunia's--shoulder. Harry and the man met each other's eyes and twenty years fell away in moments.  He had shed most of his weight, or grown into it, Harry thought, though vestiges of heavy jowls, a gut plumped by one too many beers, was noticeable under his simple pinstriped suit. His blonde hair had receded, a crown he kept cut short, and there was something different in his eyes. Something kind, gentle. ""Hello, Dudley,"" Harry said. ""Harry,"" Dudley said carefully, giving him a polite nod. ""I... I never thought we'd actually bump into you."" ""Who's he, dad?"" little Petunia asked. Dudley swallowed. He gazed at Harry, perhaps trying to read the calm look on his face, as crowds of people parted around them. Laughter and excitement faded to uncertainty.  ""An old fr..."" Dudley shook his head. ""This is my cousin, Petunia. Harry Potter."" Petunia marched around the back of her trolley and stuck her hand out. ""Nice to meet you, Harry Pot--"" Her sparkling blue eyes widened. ""I read about you! You're in *The Fall of the Dark Lord* by Hermione Granger."" A smile touched Harry's face, but not his eyes. He took Petunia's hand and shook once, politely. ""Been a long time,"" he said to Dudley. ""Never thought I'd see you on this platform, though stranger things have happened and all that."" Dudley nodded once. A long silence stretched toward uncomfortable. ""How are your parents?"" Dudley cleared his throat and glanced sideways at Petunia. ""We don't... we haven't really spoken so much in the last few years. They knew Petunia was..."" He grit his teeth and forced a smile. ""You can imagine."" ""All too well,"" Harry said, and that was enough. He'd learnt long ago not to let the past hurt. ""I want to get on the train, dad!"" Petunia said, bouncing on the spot, foot to foot, eager and excited. Dudley nodded. ""Go see your mother. She's talking to the conductor down there, and get your belongings loaded onto the train. I'll be along shortly."" ""Where do the first-years go?"" she asked. ""Do you know, Mr Potter?"" Dudley looked uncertain. Harry knelt down on his haunches till he was eye level with the little girl. ""Anywhere they like,"" he said. ""It's a big train, plenty of room, and lots of snacks to be had on the trip up. But if you do feel lost, look for a girl named Lily. She'll help you find the right compartment."" ""Really?"" Petunia asked. Harry nodded most seriously. ""Lily is your second cousin. Family look out for each other."" Petunia mulled that over and then took her trolley off down the platform with a massive grin. Harry stood and met Dudley's unsure, guilty look. ""Family look out for each other,"" Dudley said, his words hollow, almost gaunt. Harry crossed his arms over his chest. ""I don't blame you for what happened when we were kids, Dudley. We were just that, you know. Kids."" ""What my parents did to you..."" Harry raised his hand. ""Forgiven, not forgotten. But I hope to never see them again. That's all I'll say."" ""It's different,"" Dudley began and gave a nervous chuckle. ""When it's your kid, it's different. I'm so proud of her, Harry. For being special. For being... well, her."" Harry could understand that. He had three of his own, with plans for a fourth. The wizarding world needed more children, more life and light. ""Is it safe for her?"" Dudley asked. ""...Hogwarts?"" ""Yes,"" Harry said. ""I've spent my life making sure of that."" ""Thank you for pointing Petunia in Lily's direction. I worry she'll be a bit behind the others."" Harry chuckled softly and clapped his cousin on the arm. ""The owl - that was your idea?"" ""Mary thought I was mad,"" Dudley said. ""That's my wife. She's normal--I mean, non-magical. Sorry. When I told her I knew some of this world,"" he waved around at the train, the platform, the blue in the sky, ""she almost went to stay at her mother's. It's a hard thing, keeping this secret."" Harry thought about that, memories of his time at Privet Drive flashing through his mind. Memories of long ago, and so much worse, the dark years, the struggle after the war. ""I'll get Lily to speak to your daughter,"" he said. ""We can exchange a few owls, if you like. Any questions you might have."" Dudley stared at Harry for a long moment. ""You'd do that? After... well, everything?"" He looked flabbergasted. ""I don't know if I'd be so kind, if the roles were reversed."" ""I've seen what can happen to someone who dwells on unkindness, and anger. I've seen it tear the world apart."" Harry offered his hand and Dudley grasped it firmly. ""Never again."" **** Check out my fancy new writing subreddit, where I'm keeping all my r/writingprompts stories - [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeDucie/). **** Edit: Thanks for the feedback, everyone.

It was the type of money you used to hire the most expensive prostitutes in America, tell them to pretend to be bankers, and have them meet for lunch in *Le Bernardin* in the heart of Manhattan. Each thought they were meeting a client, both were told to never break act. I sat at the table next to theirs, twirling a stainless steel pen with the letters *Goldman Sachs* gilded on. The girl, Anna, was the first to arrive. A tight black skirt hugged her figure. The skirt was short, but work-appropriate short. She was the best prostitute *Fuck You* money could buy which meant she was the best in the world. She turned her wrist and checked a silver Rolex. It was a Daytona model. She had certainly done her research. The guy, Brandon, soon followed. He wore a navy blue suit without a single crinkle. I glanced down at his shoes. Brooks Brothers, custom-made. It looked hand-crafted even. A smile touched my lips as he sat down and extended his hand for a handshake. “Anna, was it?” Brandon said. “Thanks for meeting me, my name’s Brandon, VP at JPMorgan Chase, housing division.” Anna returned him a firm shake. “Nice to meet you. I’m a VP at Merrill Lynch, risk division.” “Look at us, if our bosses found us here. They’d have our bonuses.” She laughed and took a sip of wine. “So, I was told that you had a business proposal for me?” This was it, the reason I had dropped five figures on two prostitutes. Brandon would fumble through banking buzz words and financial pseudo-sciences as I sat back, laughing at his stupidity. Then Anna would follow in their dance of idiocrasy, all the way until they left *La Bernadin*, never to return because they couldn’t afford even its dress code. My pen twirled in anticipation. “Credit default swaps,” Brandon said. “It’s insurance against bad loans. So if we make a string of bad investments, even when we lose, we make money, just not as much.” Anna furrowed her brow. “I work risk at Merrill Lynch, I know how to lower risk.” A giggle tickled my throat. What would a prostitute know about credit default swaps? He probably read the first Wikipedia paragraph and now thought himself an expert. I wondered who would be the bigger idiot, Brandon or Anna? “What if we pair that up with thousands of high-risk loans?” “Like we already do?” Anna asked. “But not *individually*.” Brandon leaned forward, his voice lowered so I had to strain my ears just to hear his words. “We pool them all together and then securitize them into a single asset. Tell me Anna, what happens when you bundle risk?” “It drops,” Anna said. “But those have been around for a while now. Are you proposing that we just keep doing what we’re doing?” Brandon frowned. It looked like Anna had done more research than him. I pretended to cough to stifle my laughter. It was he who would look the fool! “Wait,” Anna said, “but how about we talk to the ratings agencies. The bigger the pool of assets, the lower the risk. If we get a big enough pool, any sort of shitty asset could have a triple-A rating.” My jaw dropped and I broke character by staring straight at her. The two didn’t even notice, they were so buried in their conversation. “We can lower it further by having it asset-backed. Like a car loan,” Brandon said, his voice rising with his excitement. “Like a mortgage!” Anna said. “We can sell janitors million dollar houses on loans they’ll never pay off, pool all those loans together, and then sell them off as a Triple-A asset before they crash and burn.” My fingers trembled, but not with the same excitement I had purchased. They were right. Banks could securitize all these shitty mortgages and their value would rise because their ratings would, even though the risk technically stayed exactly the same. My pen dropped to the napkin in front of me and I wrote a single phrase into it before slipping it in my pocket and leaving. *Sub-prime mortgages.* --- --- /r/jraywang for daily WP stories, continuations by popular demand, and more!",16328

A trickle of red ran down the man's skin, dripping down onto the parched desert floor. ""Please,"" Iu-iu begged, ""I can't go on."" ""That is your prerogative, but if you fall human, know that you will never get back up."" The collector smiled, his black, jagged teeth dipping out of his mouth. Iu-iu stumbled back into line of men and women, and placed his blistered hands around the thick rope. The huge brick moved onwards, soon reaching the great structure's shadow. The collector watched, satisfied. This was his favourite part of the Re-Culture - where his race would step in to help put humanity on the *right track*. For a thousand more years, he would be held as a God. Worshipped and adulated by the pathetic race around him. Then, after another five thousand years, the planet would be ready to harvest. The brick was almost by the structure when Iu-iu fell. The collector ran his long tongue over his lips as he walked toward the body. He bent down, and in a single swift motion, snapped the man's neck. Then, he hoisted him over his shoulder and took him toward a nearby chamber, well hidden under the sand.  He would feast well tonight. --- ""Captain,"" said first officer Kate Robins, ""we've found another planet."" Captain Richardson leaned down to the - now lit - monitor on the arm of his chair.

""I am into old *stuff* - but we won't find an explanation for the cloned biospheres in the past. A version of Earth more advanced than our own, however, might be able to tell us."" ""You never know what we'll find down there, Pirano,"" replied Richardson. ""Captain,"" Kate said, there's... something *odd* down there."" ""Odd? How so?""

6yzr6x,Edit: I went to sleep and woke up to this post kinda blowing up...,"I have this recurring dream where my alarm clock is blaring and I open my eyes to see my parents still alive in front of me. My father breathes without the oxygen tank that he had carried around with him for the last six years of his life. My mother’s withering grey curls are a luscious blonde and her cheeks are once again plump and red. She slides her fingertips down my cheek, smiling. “Did you sleep well?” she asks. “Are you awake?” And right before I respond, I wake. My psychologist says that I lack closure, that I still haven’t gotten over their deaths. But I disagree. Their deaths weren’t tragic. Well, of course all deaths are tragic, especially deaths of parents. But my father slipped quietly away into the night on his favorite chair and my mother died holding my hand, surrounded by family who loved her dearly. They each had funerals, wakes, and other remembrances. I had an annual tradition of bringing my grandkids to their grave so I could take another shot of whiskey with my father and give my mother lilies as gold as her hair. Still, my psychologist tells me that a part of me hasn’t yet accepted their death. I want to tell him that I’m eighty-four years old and only here because three grandkids and two children of my own don’t fill the long stretches of silence in my life. They visit, often. But a man still gets lonely. So I don’t tell him. I entertain him, nodding my head and humming as he tells me how to live out the rest of my year or so (being optimistic) as best as I can. “It might not be their death,” he tells me. “It might just be death in general. You haven’t accepted it.” To which, I smile and nod. It is the polite thing to do. The impolite thing would be to burst out laughing at the thirty year old man recently engaged telling an eighty-four year old about embracing death. I accepted my own mortality very long ago. So once again, I entertain him. I barrage him with questions he could never hope to answer and he does his best. “It won’t hurt,” he tells me. “You’ll find peace. It’ll be like gently letting go and slipping away to whatever next world you believe in. Like falling asleep. Isn’t that nice? When you close your eyes and you gently fall asleep.” “Promise it won’t hurt?” I ask. He gives me a smile teeming with confidence, as if he knew anything. “I promise.” His words play back to me whenever I go to sleep. And every night, I drift further into my dream. It becomes that much more real. The beeping. The parents. The fingertips. It feels more real than reality, as if my whole life had simply been the dream of a nine year old boy still asleep, but unable to wake. “Did you sleep well?” I hear my mother ask. “Are you awake?” I open my eyes, expecting to see my popcorn ceiling and revolving wood fan. Instead, I see my mother, her golden locks curling at her shoulders and her fingertips brushing my cheek. “Did you have a nice dream?” she asks, tears filling her eyes. I give her a nod and turn toward the alarm clock. It’s not an alarm clock, but a heartbeat monitor. My father stands beside it, his eyes constantly shifting from the monitor to me. He crosses his arms and presses his lips into a thin line. “It won’t hurt,” he says, a tremor in his voice. “You’ll find peace. Like falling asleep.” I give him a nod as well. “Or waking up from a long dream,” I tell him, my voice barely a whisper. It's all I can  manage. My father covers his mouth and chokes on his breath. His shoulders heave. My mother squeezes my hand and presses her lips against it. “Good night, sweet prince,"" she whispers. ""Sweet dreams.""  --- --- /r/jraywang for 5+ stories weekly and 200+ stories already written!  ",2126
71yqh0,"This is my first prompt, so I hope someone out there enjoys it. :)","*I hurried myself up the stairs, hoping that the library would still be open when I arrived. I'd been late on returning my books for the fourth time this month and would receive a severe fee if I didn't return them today. A grumpy looking woman in her sixties frowned at me as I surged past, but I didn't care: I made it on time.* *I pushed the glass doors open and...""* Jim shut the book and put it down on the floor. After he picked it up in the library, simply because the cover had drawn him to it, he noticed a few strange similarities. As if the book was about him. The library was closing only a few minutes after he arrived, and he anxiously decided to take it home with him. The younger man at the desk didn't notice his nervous shuffling as he scanned his books for him. Before he could hand them over properly, Jim had already grabbed the books and hurried himself out of the library. Now sitting on his bed at home, Jim stared at the cover. *Jim's life, By Jim*, was all it said. *It fits*, Jim thought, *everything fits. Even the damn trip to the library is in there. How does that even work?* Absent-mindedly he flipped open a page and glanced through it. Halloween ten years ago. Jim couldn't help but grin as he recollected the events of that night. He and his friends went out trick-or-treating and, losing track of the time, they continued until long after they were supposed to be home. At eleven his parents had found him wandered off in the neighborhood, sitting on a bench with his friends, all shoving ungodly amounts of sugar into their faces. It was one of the more stern talkings he got in his life, but it had been worth it. They'd created a special bond of friendship over that night, and he still talked to them daily. *and so my parents put me in bed and took the bag of candy downstairs, and I fell asleep in no-time. But I wouldn't realise that the exact recollection of this memory would unfold a chain of events not even I could have foreseen. More on that on page 52.* ""Wait, *what*?"" Jim mumbled to himself. He didn't remember anything that even happened that night. He fell asleep, woke up the next morning and while his parents were still a bit angry about his recklessness, nothing bad had come out of it. He picked up the book again and browsed forward until he arrived at the right page. *I picked it up the book again after seeing that strange mention. I'm sitting on my bed, and I read about sitting on my bed, in this exact sentence. I realize, right at this moment, that it can't be an exact description of what happened. Because, if that were true, why wouldn't it tell me about the fact that this was written down by someone, probably me. And, if that certain person, me, had written this, then their own time-line would've been different, as they wouldn't have had the book to read in the first place, because no one had written it yet! Timelines certainly are confusing, I thought then, and even while I'm writing this I nod in agreement. Is it a single timeline, alternative timelines, self-filfulling timeline? Who knows? I don't know. Or at least, not yet. That was the moment when I put the book back do-* Jim shut the book and rubbed his temples. This was all too confusing. It was his life, no mistake, and even the fact he wrote it himself he could understand, even if that was too absurd of a thought to take in normally. But the fact his life was out-lined exactly as it happened was worrying. Especially considering he had only read up until exactly this moment and that was only about a tenth in!  *Should I read further?* Jim asked himself, conflicted. This could be a situation where by reading the book he would solidify the content within, making the events unfold as they would because of the fact he read them in the first place. Or should he ignore the book, throw it under the bed somewhere and forget about it, and simply lead his own life? He didn't know. He put the book on his desk, shoving it away. Nothing bad or unfixable had happened yet, and the fact he'd discovered the book shouldn't change anything necessarily, he hoped. *It just happened, and now*, he thought, *I can just go back to how life was before this damned library trip.* He picked up his school bag with a sigh and took out his Spanish textbook and notebook. Demonstratively he started to complete the exercises as if the book didn't matter, but he didn't do it all too convincingly. Annoyed at the mistakes he was making he put down his pencil and picked up a pen and crossed out the wrongly spelled words. He put the pen back down as he reached for the pencil to correct his notes and then his heart skipped a beat. He had an idea. ",1472

7b5xx3,"Six months ago, I answered a prompt where superpowers are determined by birth location and the first person had just been born in space.  Now it's a finished novel! Here is the original prompt from user /u/mdmarshmallow **[Superpowers are based on the topography of where someone is born (IE: Mountains, deserts, etc.). The first person has just been born in space.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/65f88x/wp_everyone_has_a_superpower_based_on_the/)** Now, after six months, 95 chapters, and over 90k words, that response became a full novel!  A huge thanks go out to the redditors that helped me arrive at this point through their support, critiques, and kind words. [Kindle copies available for only $2.99](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Child-Places-Leonard-Petracci-ebook/dp/B076PGG2XK), which can be read on phone, computer, or tablets!   **Here is chapter 1, which was the original response that spurred everything forwards** It was an accident, of course. My birth, my being in space, and well, I suppose I was an accident as well. An accident from the director of engineering screwing the fat janitor after hours when the rest of the shuttle team had retired; the odds that my mother had been able to hide her baby bump for nine months, the chances that she had been a nurse before being selected from the program and knew how to give birth herself, in a maintenance closet, mere days before the mission was to return to earth. Keeping me hidden was difficult in the small confines of the ship, but the other hundred and fifty crew members had been too busy to pay a mere maid much attention. After all, many insisted that it had not been worthwhile to bring her along, that a maid had been a waste of tax dollars. I suppose that makes me a waste of tax dollars as well. But there were those that spoke to her unique abilities as a maid. For she had been born deep in the snow of the north, during the first blizzard of winter, that like the first snowfall, she could smooth over any differences in her environment and make it appear uniform. As a maid, it meant that she had an extraordinary sense of cleanliness. As a mother, it meant she could ensure I was overlooked, that my crying was muffled, and later in life, that I appeared no different from anyone else. Star Child, she had called me as she smuggled me back into the atmosphere, tucked deep in her suit like a kangaroo would carry her young. Star Child, she whispered to me when the project disbanded, and she took me to the inner city apartment where I spent my early life. Star Child, she reprimanded whenever I started pushing and pulling at the equilibrium of our apartment, when she would arrive home from work and all the furniture would be clustered at the center of the room, pulled together by a force point. “When will I go to school?” I asked her when I was eight, watching the uniformed children marching up the street through the wrought-iron gates of the academy, one of them flicking flames across his fingers like a coin while another left footprints of frost in the grass. “You already go to school, Star Child,” she said. “And your teachers say you've been learning your numbers well, and your reading has been progressing.” “Not *that* school,” I had said, pulling a face. “I want to go to the academy. The special school, for the others like me!” I held up a fist, and items on the desk in front of me flew towards it, pens and papers and pencils that stuck out like quivering quills out of my skin. “Star Child, listen and stop that at once,” she said, her eyes level with mine. “There *are* no others like you. Those children; they are all classified, they are all known. You are *not* like them, you never will be. And they can't know, do you understand me?” “I guess,” I answered with a huff, watching as one of the children cracked a joke and the others laughed. “But I don't like my school. Everyone there knows we can't be like them, that we can't be special.” “Star Child, you *are* special. One day, they'll know that too. But not now – if they knew, they wouldn't take you to the academy. They'd take you somewhere else, somewhere terrible.” And as I grew older, I realized that she was right. That when our neighbor started developing powers, a police squad showed up at her front door and classified her on the spot. That they left her with a tattoo on her shoulder, a tattoo of a lightning bolt, symbolizing the storm during which she had been born. Just like the tattoo of a snowflake on my mother's shoulder, colored dull grey, to indicate a low threat potential. So instead of going to the academy, I created an academy of my own, in my room. Mother made me turn the lights out at ten, so during the day, I collected light outside, keeping it in one of the dark holes I could create when I closed my fist hard enough, and letting it loose at night to read books I had stolen from the library. From the section for the special children, that I could only access if the librarians were distracted. But distractions came easy to me. As I grew older, the city streets became more populated with the blue uniforms of police. The academy became increasingly harder to attend, and the gifted girl next door disappeared one night without a note. Mother stopped letting me outside after dark, and the lines for the soup kitchens grew longer. The skies grew darker, the voices accustomed to speaking in whispers, and the television news seemingly had less and less to report. It was as if there was a blanket thrown upon us, but no one dared look to see who had thrown it. But I would. And when I did, I realized the earth needed a Star Child. *** [For only $2.99, you can have your own kindle copy by clicking here!](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Child-Places-Leonard-Petracci-ebook/dp/B076PGG2XK) *** [90% of this book is already free online on my subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/65jl9n/star_child_part_1/), but the chapters are not all edited and still in the process of being posted.

7bkepd,Edit. Wow thank you to everyone who submitted thie stories here. Never expected it to blow up this much.,"It wasn't abnormal to hide your birth mark. Some were just embarrassing. Of course most people didn't hide them, it was a point of pride. My father, for example, never wore a sleeve covering his right arm. He showed it with pride, he was the pale bear of the townstead, always there to help out, the sheriff of the people. A legend in his youth, it's said that he once crushed a man's skull  with his bare (bear?) hands. An evil man, with a red viper crawling up his face had tried to rob the general store. Well, not on my father's watch.  My mother, she was a little more conventional. The wee little dove on her collarbone demonstrated her compassion, her love and, well, her unique ability to calm a situation. A pacifist through and through my father would always call her. They were a perfect match, his hot - headedness always being diffused by her gentle nature. But, ever since I was born, my birth mark had been covered. I'd been dressed in long sleeves since before I can remember. Every night I see it though. A cold blue serpent monster climbing up my left arm, wings sprawling over my back and a mouth filled with a thousand needles ending just on my shoulders. The coal that burned instead of eyes would glare at me, it's hideous hot smile baring those sickening teeth. The leviathan.  It was a monster. A daemon. Something from a nightmare. And yet it was a part of me. I could feel his power and hatred coursing through my veins, just as my father with his bear. It scared me. Well, it used to scare me. Until the day they came to my village. A small army had come to claim my land for some foreign king. They had begun butchering the men, until my fathering came barrelling in, heavy fists crushing the foreign men beneath him. The town rallied behind him, fighting back these strange invaders. I watched, glued to to the horror. Death followed him to the centre, before a spear pierced his throat. A scream ripped from my mouth, blood-curdling and sickening. The battle stopped and the invaders and townsfolk staggered back, staring at me. I felt the leviathan within me whisper. 'Kill them all,' he said. The power inside him seeped into me, slowly at first, but soon a storm raged inside me, an almost uncontrollable fury. I glanced into a nearby window and saw my face, a young girl with a hot smile spot welded to her lips, and eyes that glowed like coal. A howl escaped my lips and I let the storm go free. Edit: Grammar and some spelling mistakes. Obligatory thanks for the gold kind stranger - it's my first one! :D. As a note to everyone who read this and liked this, thank you so much for the support.

7dcwik,Edit: mum im famous,"Conventions are my favorite time of the year. We all knew we were killers, and knowing who all the other killers were helped people get along. Sold a secret? Everyone would hunt you down the next day.  Everyone had their flair out, so you could have as much fun as you wanted while still fitting in. The Japanese would dress all in earth tones, while the Italians would put on fantastically gauche suits. The British, as always, sent their best in a tuxedo. I wore my best denim.  Nobody ever expected a Canadian assassin. We were there in WWII, killing Hitler in his bunker before the other Allies even arrived. They had to burn the body and claim suicide to cover up their incompetence. We were there when Osama bin Laden was found. I'll bet the Navy Seals won't tell you they found him chained to his desk with a complimentary last meal of poutine.  Don't think we're friendly. We don't take anybody's side but Canada's. We were there when JFK was shot. It was so simple to play one superpower against another and score lucrative deals for the Canadarm project. It's nice to know we can smuggle a high-powered laser into space, even if it's only one shot.  Still, an assassin is only as good as his cover. We instill our children from an early age just how to act in public while we train them in private how to apply political pressure points as well as physical ones. We're the kindest, nicest people around when somebody is watching.  We train to be normal and accepting, while pushing the idea that a sneaky killer has to know kung fu and how to throw daggers. The Japanese popular culture has already been successfully subverted, and we're working with a mole at Ubisoft to produce more Assassin's Creed games to subvert Arab, British, Italian and now Egyptian cultures. They would never suspect us.  We could even get away with an assassination here at the convention, just for fun. I bump into another excited conventioneer dressed head-to-toe, embarassingly, in his mother's best black sheets. I pull the punch knife from his kidney slowly while the invisible needle in his neck stops him from screaming.  ""Sorry."" EDIT: Got the Assassin's Creed publisher wrong. Changed ""EA"" to ""Ubisoft."" EDIT: Thank you, kind stranger!",4871
7en7vl,"https://www.battleforthenet.com/#bftn-action-form Edit: Obligatory thanks for the gold! Just trying to do my part on this fight, but as I don't live in the US, raising awareness is the most I can do, glad it worked!","The suite on the sixth floor of the Trump International Hotel, Washington D.C., was decorated in chestnut and tan.  The headboard of the king size bed was carved as if it was a coat of arms of some legitimate monarch, and was trimmed with fake gold, which poorly matched the Kremlin red, velvet throw pillows.  Like the room's single, useless accent wall, the curtains were a brutal cerulean, suggesting a space that conceals more deception than the dark seabed of a Vladivostok harbor.  In all, the suite was reminiscent of something a Tsar might have once maintained, perhaps as quarters for secondary guests in some Eastern Palace.  Nevertheless, on that particular Pennsylvania Avenue afternoon, Ajit Pai, FCC Chairman, felt anything but secondary.   Ajit rolled over on the sheets, letting his chesthair peak out from his robe, and then stretching all the way from his scapula to his calves.  Laying beside him, Lowell C. McAdam, CEO of Verizon Communications, picked another chocolate covered strawberry from the bowl.  He placed it in Ajit's mouth, letting his hand linger on his former General Counsel's lips just a moment too long. ""You know I love dessert,"" Ajit said, ""but I hope you have something else for me."" ""I don't recall you ever being so direct before, my Sugar Plum"" Lowell returned, clasping Ajit's buttocks. ""Maybe those FTC boys go easy on you,"" Ajit answered, pulling away, but only a little, only for show, ""but I'm from the FCC, so you better show me the cash first!"" Lowell sighed.  He spun off the bed.  He sauntered over to the bureau and picked up a leather briefcase with two silver latches.  Lowell showed Ajit what was inside: stacks and stacks of crisp hundred dollar bills. ""Just to be clear,"" Lowell explained, ""every last cent of this is to repeal net neutrality.  You're giving me that ass for free."" Lowell pounced down on top of Ajit, groping at him the way a crude man only does to a prostitute.  Ajit loved feeling bought and paid for.  He giggled and squealed, and the two men kissed. But suddenly, the passion and privacy of the suite was shattered by a flash of light and a thunderous clap.  The hideous furniture Ivanka had inexplicably wanted credit for rattled along the carpet.  When the two lovers and conspirators regained their composure, there was a strange young man and woman standing before them, wearing tattered jeans and leather vests.  They both had AK-47s draped over their shoulders.  The woman punched Ajit hard in the jaw. ""Are you Ajit Pai the FCC chairman or Ajit Pai the cricketer!"" she demanded.  Her face was stained with dirt. ""What?  Who are you?  Where did you come from?"" Ajit asked, favoring his chin, his whole body quivering. ""FCC chairman or cricketer!"" the woman shouted again, brandishing the AK-47 at the frightened, half naked businessman, and lobbyist pretending to be a guard of the public interest. ""FCC!"" Ajit replied, ""Yes, I'm with the FCC!"" ""You know why she had to ask that, motherfucker?"" the rough man began, ""because the only other famous Ajit Pai was a fucking cricket player, and where we come from, Wikipedia pages take twenty minutes to load, unless you pay an extra $9.99 a month!  So all we really had to go on was the fucking disambiguation page.  You know how hard it is to tell an artificially intelligent time machine where you want to go, when all it can access are the goddamn disambiguation pages?"" The man picked Ajit up, and threw him onto the bed.  He did the same to Lowell. ""Your little side deal here,"" the woman explained to the telecommunications executives, ""let me tell you how this goes down.  First, you repeal net neutrality for some chump change kickback.  Then, of course, all the asshole ISPs start tacking on surcharges for people to get on pretty much all the good websites, until nobody could afford more than one.  So, the same thing happened that always happens when you force people to choose teams.  Society broke apart completely.  Soon, the Youtubian Republic was throwing molotov cocktails at the Facebook Moms, and the Netflixtariat were being rounded up by the Insta-thots.  Nobody talks to each other or shares anything, and it is terrible.""    Ajit and Lowell looked to the door and windows, thinking of any possible escape.  But there was none.  They were hostages of an uncaring power who had no concern for their well being. ""But there was one silver lining to not having the web you're used to,"" the rough man continued, ""Without an open internet, nobody else got to find out that we finally cracked how to build a fully operational time machine.  We didn't tweet about it or do a single AMA.  Because why would we?  There'd be nobody online to see it.  That means we were able to skip all the bullshit and just travel right back here, right to this moment, before you two fucked each other, and then the whole country."" ""Are,"" Lowell stammered, ""are you going to kill us?"" The time travelers laughed, then stuck peculiar glowing orbs on the lovers' chests. ""No, we're not going to kill you,"" the woman replied, ""instead, we're just going to send you boys into the future you're trying to create.  And we'll stay back here in 2017, when things were at least only halfway terrible."" ""What?  No, you can't!"" Ajit shouted. ""Sure we can,"" the man told him, ""because time travel has no regulations.  I thought you loved it when technology has no regulation."" The woman pushed a button on a strange remote.  The suite filled with another flash of light. Ajit and Lowell embraced.  They vanished.      ",5071

7t3vyo,Just an idea that randomly popped up in my head. ,"My sneakers tapped gently against the pavement as I walked briskly down the street. I squeezed my way through the peak-hour human traffic, catching whiffs of overly-strong perfume and worse, overly-strong body odor. I don’t like people much. I mean that in the nicest way possible. Two’s company, three’s a crowd, anything more than that is a nightmare. Trying to ignore the occasional sweaty body that rubbed too close against mine as I wormed through the crowd, I wished that everyone would just *stop moving*.  And then, all of a sudden, they did. The sounds of shoes pattering against the pavement and car horns blaring as frustrated drivers crawled through stand-still traffic disappeared into thin air, as if they’d never been there. A perfect, fragile silence descended upon the world. Every single person, object and animal was frozen. The fat man in a shirt clearly too small for him had stopped, his pudgy leg stretched out mid-stride. A teenage girl with highlights in her hair swept aside her fringe with one hand, the other raised in mid-air in an attempt to adjust her earphones. A flock of pigeons hung artificially in the air, like some sort of elaborate piece of abstract art dangling from the ceiling of a museum.  Yet even as the world froze around me, I continued moving. In that heartbeat when everything else was locked in time, my left foot landed solidly on the ground, and unconsciously, my right foot had moved forwards, about to take another step. Then I stopped. Nothing compelled me to, not like *something* seemed to compel everything and everyone else to stop, no. I just stood there, in shock and awe. Had my ‘wish’ caused this to happen? What was going on? And yet, even as my thoughts became a jumbled mess, I couldn’t help but smile. Moving around was *so* much easier with everyone stopped in place.  As it turns out, no, I wasn’t the one who caused that to happen. Time abruptly resumed a short while later, as if nothing at all had transpired. By then, I was out of the crowd, tucked away in the corner of a quiet café. I only noticed when the barista started to move again, the sound of beans being crushed in a grinder giving me the shock of my life.  The freezes happened over and over again, at random intervals. They never lasted very long, but I definitely wasn’t the one doing it. In fact, as the phenomenon occurred more and more, I *knew* for sure that someone else was stopping time. There’s no good way to explain it, but I could *feel* their presence, somewhere, not too close, but not too far away. I didn’t know if they could sense me too, the way I could sense them, but I knew that they were out there. So far, I hadn’t seen anything or anyone else move during those freezes.  It may sound stupid now, but I was content to enjoy those little moments while they lasted. It usually wasn’t inconvenient, and it led to some really cool opportunities to prank my friends, or to escape from throngs of people in a busy mall. I knew that my ‘partner-in-crime’ was out there, but I had no desire to find them. In hindsight, that was a mistake.  My sneakers tapped gently against the pavement as I walked briskly against the street. It was a day much like the one when I had first experienced the peculiar sensation of being the only sentient person in a world of frozen time. Once again, I squeezed through the peak-hour human traffic. Once again, my senses were bombarded by a host of things I hated dealing with. And once again, not unlike many of the other times, I quietly wished that my time-stopping partner might decide to freeze time once more, to allow me to slip out from this nightmare.  Surprisingly enough, time stopped. It wasn’t often that time stopped at a convenient juncture, so I took the opportunity to dash out of the sticky- literally- situation that I’d found myself enclosed in. And yet, as I took in a gulp of fresh air, something felt wrong.  It took me a moment to realize what it was. I was having trouble sensing the time-stopper. It wasn’t like the first time, when I just wasn’t aware of them, no. It was as if they were… fading away. Like the dying flame of a candle, about to wink out of existence.  Belatedly, I wondered what’d happen to me if they vanished while the world was frozen.  We always think of the important things just a little too late. I felt that pulse from the time-stopper grow weaker and weaker, slowly dissipating like a fine dust floating into the atmosphere. I prayed that time would resume, that everything would go back to normal.  And yet, that perfect, fragile silence remained intact. Every single person, object and animal was still frozen. The random passers-by were all stuck in time, locked in place, halfway through their last action before the world had decided to stop. A flock of crows hung artificially in the air, like some sort of elaborate piece of abstract art dangling from the ceiling of a museum. I screamed, my voice ricocheting and echoing off the tall buildings that surrounded me.  But no response came.  *****   *more stories at /r/chasing_mist* *I write a story a day [here](http://yearofpilgrimage.wordpress.com)* ",4844
7trxtl,"Well this has blown up big time!! Almost on the front page, the stories so far are all amazing! Keep them coming!!","They all stood on the deck of the submarine, staring up at the sight looking back at them. It had taken them a while to realize that anything was wrong - when you're underwater, a storm is a passing concern, of little note.  Their research needed doing, and whatever waves roiled the surfacae above their heads was irrelevant.  Each of the scientists was pinned to their display, continuing their analysis on the deepsea flora and fauna they'd come to examine. When the sensors began screaming their alarm, it had taken some time for them to even realize what was happening.  Currents, it seemed, thrown horribly out of whack by whatever was going on up top.  One after another they screamed their complaint, blown further and further off target from their subject matter, but nothing they did could stop it. After the waters finally calmed, giving them back some semblance of control, they'd paddled their way back up to the open air, and filed out for some much needed relief. And then they saw it. ""Jess, you need to calm down.""  He said, his arm wrapped around her shoulders securely. She shook her head, eyes still wide and staring.  Each breath came more ragged and gasping than the one before.  ""I-I don't know how you can *say* that.  Damn it, Paul,  I don't know how you can expect me to be calm when-"" ""Look, we don't know what's going on, all right?""  He turned her to face him, tearing her eyes away from the heavens.  ""They're looking into it.  But you falling apart right now helps *no one*."" Across the narrow deck, Matt waved, catching his eye.  Sighing, Paul shunted Jessica into the arms of one of her colleagues and strode over. ""Damn it, Matt.  What the hell is-"" ""It's all here, Paul.""  Matt said, his face white.  Paul stopped.  ""Everything lines up right as it should.  The oxygen density of the water.  Salinity content.  Hell, even the *stars* are all the same."" Paul rubbed his face, exhausted. ""But why *that*, then?""  His finger stabbed up into the sky, pointing towards the two tiny, brightly glowing orbs in the sky. Two moons.  The sight had sent half their team into dumbfounded silence - and the other half into hysterics.  Those who could speak had theorized wildly, everything from group halluncinations to transdimensional storms carrying them to distant worlds as though this were some sort of science fiction novel. That, at least, they could rule out.  By all indications, they were home. ""Theia.""  Zack said, staring up at the sky a little ways off.  The lot of them stopped, turning to him. ""Excuse me?""  Paul said, grabbing him by the arm.  Zack's eyes snapped to him, finally. ""Theia.  Some scientists think that Earth was impacted by some other planet, some other *mass*.  Some have theorized that originally, after the material all sprayed out into space....""  He pointed up towards the sky.  ""We had two moons."" Paul stared up at it, the thoughts churning wildly.  It didn't make *sense*.  ""What the hell are you saying, Zack?"" He shook his head, rubbing his face desperately.  Each of them was running on fumes, in dire need of a good meal and a few hours sleep.  They each knew that they weren't likely to get it. ""I-I don't know.  Maybe we're in the past?  May-maybe it's some sort of, I don't know.  Parallel dimension, where things didn't play out the same?""  He shook his head.  ""Either way, Paul, we're not *home* anymore."" Paul tried to ignore the pit opening up in his stomach.  ""But we're still on *Earth*."" ""...I-I think so."" ""You *think*."" ""Damn it, Paul, I don't have any more answers than you do.""  Zack spat, ripping his hand free of his face as he turned on the senior researcher. Paul raised his hands placatingly, realizing he'd pushed the man a bit too far.  ""Sorry.  I'm sorry.  I know.  I'm just on edge too.  I'm sorry.""  He sighed, looking back towards the rest of the team milling about. ""All...all right.  So here's what we do.""  He tried to plaster a confident facade onto his face.  ""If this is really Earth, then the land should be the same, right?  At least, if this is...our time.""  He said, hating himself for even saying it out loud.  He was a *scientist*, dammit.  Not some sort of fiction writer.  ""So here's what we do.  We go back to base.  We see what's there.  If it's *not* there, well..."" ""We'll know something is horribly wrong.""  Zack said softly.  Paul nodded, turning towards the rest of his crew and opening his mouth.  He had to take charge.  They needed a leader, and he could be it.  He could- Whatever he was about to say was cut off by Sam pounding her way up the ladder from the lower decks. ""Paul!""  She cried, her face bone-white.  He caught her as she stumbled, but she only shook her head, already plowing onwards.  ""The- We had our sensors on still.  Trying to figure out what the *hell* is going on.  But something's *down* there, Paul.""  Her blue eyes were wide and terrified.  ""Something goddamn *big*.  And we think it's coming this way."" (/r/Inorai, critique always welcome!) Edit - Yes, I'm aware that stars drift in the sky over time, and if they were in the past the stars would be different.  This is intentional. ",1703
7xihva,Horror story or romantic comedy?,"Emily sat across from him at a table draped with a red satin tablecloth.  Her champagne flute remained untouched as she searched for the words to say. “I’m sorry Jacob, but,” she paused averting her gaze.  “It’s not you it’s me.”  “What do you mean?”  “I don’t think I’m ready for a long term relationship.  It’s just too much right now.  You’re great, truly.  But I think it’s best if we take a break.” “For how long?” he asked, sadness crept into his voice. She sighed quietly.  “I’ll let you know. I’m sorry,” she said rising from the table leaving him alone, head hanging. He watched her go, her heels clicking against the black and white tiled floor of the Italian restaurant.  *Well, this version didn’t work either.  Maybe she really wasn’t ready for a long term relationship,* he wondered. *Or. Maybe she doesn’t realize just how much she needs me.* He dropped a stack of money on the table and slipped into the night.  Heavy rain drops began to fall as he made his way toward Emily’s apartment.    Emily tossed herself down onto her couch and pulled her plush robe around herself.  She clutched the warm cup of tea between her hands and drank deeply.   *This is what I want,* she smiled. A quiet scratching turned her head.  *Probably the storm.* She turned the TV to listen to the home decorator explain their choices for the house they had just flipped. The scratching came again, more urgently this time.  She set her tea down, her bare feet whispered across the floor as she made her way to the front door.  She had to stand on her toes to see through the small peephole.   “I’m just hearing things,” she tried to convince herself.   Another series of frantic scratching turned her head toward the window.  She grabbed an umbrella and gripped it like a baseball bat.  Lightning flashed outside her apartment, the brilliant light briefly illuminating a small shape on her fire escape.   *Is that?* A quiet meow came from the window as a reply to her question. “You poor thing!” she cooed as she opened the window and lifted the soaking wet kitten inside.  The cat meowed happily and pressed its head against her plush robe. Emily dried him off and got a small dish of tuna fish for the cat.  It didn’t have a collar or anything that could help her identify who the cat could possibly belong to. “Well, I need to call you something. Any ideas?” *Jacob,* the cat thought to himself and meowed again. “How about Hamlet?” Jacob meowed again. *Doesn’t matter to me as long as you love me.*   --- Thanks for reading!

84pgp1,"Well I'm stupid excited to tell you guys about this. It's been a crazy couple of weeks! I wrote [a response to a prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/804ohs/wp_youre_able_to_see_a_status_window_over_other/) where everyone in the main character's world has a status window hovering over their heads--except her. Now it's a finished sci-fi novella called [**The Control Group**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BF9N6VM)! Here's a quick summary: >Eris Flynn lives in a perfect world where there is no pain, no worries, and no death. Yet, even in this ideal existence, Eris has always felt like an outsider -- the only person missing a glowing box above their head, indicating their name, mood, and health. > >Until today. > >It was chance that she met the man on the street. The man missing the same box above his head as Eris. He claimed to have answers to questions she'd never even thought to ask. Questions that threaten her very reality and everything she once accepted as truth. > >Unless Eris can determine what's real and what's fake, it could mean not just the end of Eris, but the end of existence as we have always known it. ###[Amazon link - $2.99 for an ebook or $8.99 for the print (ebook included!)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BF9N6VM) The ebook is available in all markets, and the print copy is available everywhere Amazon is willing to ship it. And I do have to say that the print version turned out incredibly cool. My copy isn't here yet (\*shakes fist at mail system*) but [imagine this](https://i.imgur.com/DYZK4MG.jpg) wrapped around a physical book. Thank you guys for existing. This is such a lovely, supportive, and talented community, and my little book wouldn't exist without you all. <3 Here's a peek at the first chapter of the book! *** Eris walked home with her eyes turned down, like she always did. After twenty long years of life, she still couldn’t get used to the stares. Everywhere she went, it seemed strangers stared at her until she raised her eyes to theirs, and then they looked away again. She learned to make herself small. Hid behind beanies and headphones and huge coats. But nothing could hide the emptiness over her head. That was strange. Irredeemably. Unrepeatably. Where you could tell anyone else’s name and basic physical statistics at a glance, Eris had nothing. She grew up staring at her peers and the magical little boxes of lights hovering over their heads. Became quickly used to the question, “Where are your stats? Are you from somewhere faraway?” And she would answer, “I’m from here,” exasperated, embarrassed. The cryptic talk baffled her. Her strangeness walled her in on all sides, blocked her off in a way from everybody. Even her own family looked at her as if she was not fully one of them. These days, Eris spoke little. She walked to work where she washed dishes alone in a dark room. Walked home again. She was alone, which she liked, because no one stared at the space over her head in disdain or confusion. She had taken to walking home with music blaring in her ears, her eyes trained on the road. It was easier to ignore the things people said than to try to forget them later. It was a little lucky, in retrospect. She never would have heard him if she did not pause to change the song right then. But then beyond her headphones she heard someone speak. She turned her head and yanked her earphones down. A homeless man, his face worn by exhaustion and time, sat on a dusty sleeping bag. His stare rooted her to the spot; his eyes were bluer than any she had ever seen. He had hung a piece of tarp over his nest like a roof. Before him sat a tin cup with a couple of one dollar bills. Eris’s dark eyes went wide and dewy with shock. “I’m sorry,” she said. “What did you say?” “I said,” the man said, with a tone of lazy surprise, “you’re real, too.” She stopped, rooted to the spot. Stared at him directly now. Just like her, there was no box hovering over his head. He simply sat on the pavement. Existing. Unobtrusive as some piece of the background. “You don’t have a stats bar,” she murmured. “Am I your first one?” His tone was bitter but delighted. “Sit down, pretty girl. Talk with me for a minute. No one ever talks to me anymore.” She sat on the concrete beside him. Breathed through her mouth, discretely. “What do you mean I’m real?” “Those other people—” he gestured to the city beyond, the cars whisking past them in a constant ebb and flow “—are not real. You and I are.” He smiled, dreamily, his eyes somewhere distant and faraway. “There were more of us, when I was young. I’ve heard they’ve begun to dismantle the whole thing.” Eris could only stare at him. Wondering if he was mentally ill. If she was an idiot for sitting here listening to him ramble. But he did not sound ill. He sounded very tired, and very sane. “What’s your name?” she asked him. “Cassius.” His stare probed her face for something. She was not sure what to offer him. “You must be one of the controls.” “I honestly don’t know what you’re talking about.” That made him start laughing in real joy and delight. He stood up and began gathering up his things. Placed them in a torn but serviceable trash bag. “You can buy me a coffee,” he told Eris, cheerily. “And I will explain everything.” She gripped her headphones, tightly. Panic chased itself in circles in her belly like a dog after its own tail. Finally she managed, dizzily, “Okay, then.” *** Okay one last time for the sake of posterity: [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BF9N6VM) | [International links](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/844zsc/the_control_group_epilogue/dvmt3lz/)",Eighteen days I've been working on my story for three years now...

86cj3t,"So this is the first thing I've ever published and I'm very excited to share it here! It started as a WP response and turned into a series that I wrote on my sub each day, for a few weeks. I then spent some time editing it, and put it together as a 30k+ words novella - and now here it is! It's called The Carnival of the Night, and here's the blurb: > Some call it purgatory, others know it as the in-between, but for those poor souls who are trapped there eternally, it is simply The Carnival — a macabre mockery where night is never-ending, and a sadistic creature known as The Fool reigns unchallenged. > And The Fool has one rule: No one leaves The Carnival. Ever. > Christopher, the latest arrival thrust reluctantly through the gates, is certain that he doesn't belong there, and he's damn sure he's not staying.  > To have any chance of escaping, he must confront not only The Fool, but his own dark past.  # [Amazon link - $2.99 for an ebook or $7.99 for the print](https://www.amazon.com/Carnival-Night-Nicholas-Carey-ebook/dp/B07B8PLZK7/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1521552336&sr=8-1) The ebook is available everywhere, but I think some places won't be able to get the print version (Canada, being one). The entire story is available, unedited, on [my sub](/r/nickofnight). It's a little over 30k words, which puts it in the novella category.  I just wanted to say thank you to the community! It's where I started writing, and I'll be continuing to write here. I'm already deep into a new series! If it wasn't for all the encouraging comments and creative prompts, I certainly wouldn't have anything up on Amazon, and I might not be writing at all. So, thank you! Below is the first chapter of the novella.  Thanks again! --- ""Hey,"" Christopher said with a dismissive nod. ""What's up?"" The girl stared up at him from her seat, her face pale, her eyes wide. But she said nothing. Her reaction threw the boy off his game, flustering him ever so slightly. He'd never just been... *looked at*. Laughed at, sure. Told to get lost, a few times. But never simply stared at. ""Uh, is that a ladder in your tights or, uh..."" He cursed himself for forgetting the end of the chat-up line. When he realized she wasn't even wearing tights beneath her skirt, he cursed again.  Still she stared. Clearly not a fan of cheesy opening lines. ""I kind of like your freckles,"" he tried. ""They're like tiny grains of sand ironed in by golden sunlight."" There, that sounded better. Almost Shakespearean. *Probably*. No reaction. Just those huge eyes that seemed to stare right through him. Enough was enough. Christopher waved a hand in front of her face. *""Hello? Anyone home?""* The girl blinked. ""*You can see me*,"" she said slowly. It was more of a statement than a question. ""You can, can't you?"" Christopher looked around, wondering if she was in fact talking to him — but the bus was otherwise empty. He could feel his cheeks burning. *Come on Christopher, say something.* ""I uh... Yeah, I got twenty-twenty vision. So don't worry, I can see you just *fine*. Can… can you see *me*?"" He winked, hoping more than believing, that the question sounded sexy. Maybe it was at least *flirty*? ""Sit,"" she hissed. ""Maybe I don't want to,"" Christopher taunted, his swagger slowly returning. *""Fucking sit. Now!""* With a last glance at the empty seats around him, he slid down next to her. ""Okay, wow, I guess I can play by those rules."" The girl didn't look at him, instead choosing to stare out of the window at the rolling hills beyond, dyed a lazy orange by the low sun. ""What time is it?"" she asked without looking away. ""Do you mean..."" ""*The time. On your watch*. I think it's a question even *you* can handle."" Christopher frowned, half enjoying her playfulness. ""Seven-thirty."" ""Morning or evening?"" ""Uh... morning. *Obviously*."" ""Then why, Christopher, is the sun setting?"" A chill ran down the boy's spine. ""How the hell do you know my-"" ""Why is the sun setting,"" she repeated, ""if it's the morning?"" ""It's *rising*, I'd guess. I mean, I didn't do great at physics but I think I've got that one covered — I only got up like an hour ago. Now tell me, *who are you?* Have you been spying on me — do you sit back here and watch me each day? Or… *oh shit*, have you hacked my phone? I mean... I guess I'm flattered..."" He ran a hand through his hair. ""But it's a little creepy. And uh, those pictures… well, you should know that's not *my*-"" ""It's *setting*. The light is orange not yellow, and it's getting darker by the minute. We're getting close."" Christopher rolled his eyes. ""Sure. Okay, the sun is setting at seven-thirty in the fucking morning."" ""Why did you get on this bus, Christopher?"" ""... Huh? Well, so I didn't miss it. Why else do people-"" ""Where's it going?"" ""To... to..."" *Where the hell was it going?* ""I-"" ""Listen to me carefully, because this is going to be hard for you to hear. You died, Christopher. Your bike was hit by a car this morning. You are dead."" The boy laughed, but a nervousness had crept into his throat. ""What is wrong you with you? Why would you say something like that?"" ""Touch the back of your head."" ""You're pretty messed up, you know that?"" he replied, but found himself reaching over his shoulder. His hand trembled as it touched... *hair*. Christopher let out a sigh that quickly turned into a swear as he felt first the wet stickiness, and then below it, a hole that his fingers slid into. They were met by a mushy texture and a sloppy squishing; Christopher wanted nothing more than to vomit. ""What the fuck!"" he screamed, as he jumped up and staggered down the aisle. ""*What's going on... What's going on... What's going on!?*"" The girl leapt up from her seat, grabbed Christopher's hand, and yanked him back down. ""Do *not* let the driver see you,"" she said slowly, sternly. ""Or you won't even make it as far as purgatory.""

87mvhk,Inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/87kajr/women_of_reddit_guys_do_stupid_things_to_impress/dwdpuj8/,"I can't even remember what we fought about. Something stupid, something trivial. Maybe she forgot to text me when she was out with her friends, maybe I forgot to get the oil changed in the car like I'd promised. But after she had slammed the door to the bedroom, and left me sitting seething on the couch, I made up my mind. I walked into my studio and uncovered my most recent series of paintings, five re-imaginings of classical sculpture subjects with assorted disabilities, and closing my eyes, I began to think of what I was going to say. The next day, in the gallery, I stepped into a crowd of society's wealthiest art connoisseurs. Slipping to the podium, I heard snatches of their conversation, analyzing the Baroque influences in my style, debating if there was any deeper significance to my use of red in the portrait of the two-headed hummingbird. She stood with them, wearing a little black dress, fingers delicately cradling her glass of champagne. We hadn't talked since the fight. We'd taken separate cars, and I didn't even know if we were still on for dinner. Well, if we were now, we wouldn't be for long. I closed my eyes and clenched my teeth, focusing everything on my new goal: soon, it would all be over. Reaching the podium, I turned my back to the curtain covering the ""Dissculptured"" series, and cleared my throat. No one heard except her, and she clinked her bangles against her champagne glass until the room fell silent. I said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to say a few words before we begin. I really appreciate your continued patronage over the years. It's brought me to a life I could only have dreamed of."" They applauded politely. I found I couldn't look at her. Instead, I stared at a painting hanging on the opposite side of the room, not mine, thank God, but an all-white canvas with the upper right corner painted red. Why, I wondered, hadn't I had the sense to go modern? Continuing, I said, ""I have to tell the truth, though. I hate painting. I only started to impress my fiance, who, until this moment, hasn't known anything more about my true feelings for artwork than any of you. But all that ends today."" Turning around, I pulled down the curtain. Everyone gasped, perhaps for my statements, perhaps for the paintings, which, I guess, were objectively my best work. Reaching into my coat pocket, I pulled out a pocket knife. ""I'm a fake!"" I shouted, stabbing the first canvas, which depicted the Venus de Milo as a Thalidomide victim and dragging the the blade down. ""I'm a *fake*!"" I plunged the knife into *Discobolus with Scoliosis*. ""And I'm *never painting another picture again*!"" Everything went red for a moment, and when I came back to myself, I was entangled in strands of canvas. She was the first to approach me. Reaching out tentatively, she took the knife from my hands, and I surrendered it helplessly. Slowly, the audience began to applaud--for her, I thought, for the end of my outburst. But the applause continued, and then cameras began flashing. As she wrapped her arm around my shoulders and started leading me to the exit, I heard one of the critics shout, ""Now *that*--that passion, that self-hatred--*that* is the mark of a truly excellent artist!"" r/pm_me_your_molars",3724

8aiv65,My first writing prompt!,"Dear Sam, If you find this note, it means that I have moved from this life to the next.  You are very dear to my heart, brother.  I hope you can find it in yourself to some day forgive me for the confession contained in this letter, and for not having the courage to tell you in life. You have done incredible things.  Your directive has brought an end to suffering.  Praises for your words ring through every corner of the earth, and your mission of peace has shaken the pieces of our society into place.  You are a true messenger for goodness in this world, and I hope you know that you are that messenger no matter how you may have thought you heard things. Now here is my most heart-breaking secret.  I am sorry for the smearing of ink, but I weep as I write this. I was there when you were at your lowest, brother.  In that dark time within our own home, when we were merely children, and you unwrapped that piece of deadly metal in our bedroom.  In your moment of grief and despair, you heard a mighty voice cry out to you, 'don't!'  And you listened.  And in your state, you didn't localize that voice to the closet, where another young boy was also weeping.  It was not God you heard, but me.   And since then, you've been listening to me. In every moment it was me. Please forgive me.  In love through life and death, John",3603
8de37y,"In a world where everyone has superpowers, having no power is a terrible thing.  It only happens once every several generations, and always alerts the curiosity of the whole world. In the past, the birth of a *null*, as they were now known, had heralded a period of great turmoil. They were the source of superstition and ritual, so it was no surprise that people tried to kill or control them as soon as they heard about them. Today, things had become marginally more civilised…but only marginally. There was nowhere for a *null* to turn for help; they were so rare that they didn’t factor into anyone’s thoughts even remotely. That is, until I was born.  The hospital where I was delivered hadn’t bothered to check for manacytes in my blood. Why would they? It was only when my parents took me in for further tests when I was a child and hadn’t manifested yet, and even then only after a veritable battery of tests had been done beforehand that the doctors suggested they test for manacyte deficiency. They had their work cut out convincing my parents it was the right thing to do. Who would want a *null* for a child? “You’ll always be our baby, no matter what” they’d said.  The test results proved them wrong.  The minute they saw what I was, they changed their tune. “It must be a mistake…did they make a mistake with the babies in the hospital?”. They were cold to me from then on, and didn’t need much convincing when the doctors offered to keep me in the facility for more tests. They needed even less convincing when the authorities asked them to sign me over to them for permanent guardianship.  The last I heard of them, my father had divorced my mother on the grounds that she had been unfaithful, while she maintained vehemently that she had never broken her vows.  That was all I remembered of warmth, of family. From then on it was a world of cold and loneliness.  I knew they hadn’t meant it at the time, but I still held on to my memories of my parents from before my diagnosis. It helped me get through the daily barrage of tests and exercises they made me do. The physical tests were easy to get used to, after a while. I could distract myself from the pain eventually. The psychological tests were what I abhorred most.  I didn’t know much about myself, but I knew I was a psychopath. I had once overheard one of them saying “well of course there’s psychopathic tendencies here. What do you expect when all we do is prod and poke it like cattle? Christ, George, it doesn’t know what human warmth even is!” --------------------- Today was different. I wasn’t woken up by the guard that would take me to my morning intravenous ration. I didn’t know how I knew it, but I had woken up early, and the moon was out. I just *knew* it was. I sat up straight on the edge of my bed, looking down at my hands. I found them profoundly fascinating for some reason. And I felt…*different*. As I held my hands up to my face, I noticed the dim red glow of the surveillance drone. The guard would be here any minute.  He was a Newtonian; he could affect one of the forces around him. His speciality was Gravity. He had used it to slam me into walls or contort me into all manner of twisted shapes when I had done something to displease him.  As I heard his footsteps getting closer and louder, I felt something I hadn’t felt before. Confidence.  He slammed the door open and held out his hand, ready to twist me back into bed. It was then that I did something I hadn’t done in a long time; I spoke. As I felt him take his stance, ready to use his powers on me, something in me urged me to scream.  “**No!**” If he was startled by my sudden verbalisations, he didn’t show it. He twisted his fingers, ready to throw me against the wall. I closed my eyes and braced myself for impact.  Nothing happened.  I opened my eyes to a look of utter bewilderment on his face. I heard his superior chime in on his comms device. “What’s taking so long? Get on with it”. He shook his head, a look of determination replacing his bewildered expression, and took his stance again.  Nothing.  He hadn’t figured it out yet, but I had. I started walking over to him, smiling. The look of confusion turned to terror as he noticed me pacing towards him. --------------------- “I’ve studied the tapes over and over again. Why yes, I do have a theory as to what happened. Do you know how long we’ve been calling them “*nulls*”? No? Neither does anyone else, which means the word is at least as old as the English language. All this time we thought it referred to the fact that they didn’t have any powers, George. No manacytes in the blood. But it’s more than that. They can *nullify* the powers of others, George. That’s where the term comes from. Someone, long ago, discovered this fact about them and it was lost through the ages…no doubt the countless wars fought in their name had something to do with it. That’s what happened with the guards and the scientists that were cut down during the escape. They simply didn’t know how to react to not having something they took for granted all their lives. Imagine being in their position, George. It’s like suddenly losing a limb! Proceed with caution. We don’t know the full extent of this ability to nullify. Be careful!” --------------------- In a world where everyone has superpowers, having no power is a terrible thing.  --------------------- **EDIT 1**: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to read my story, and to provide feedback or comment on this thread.

I want to use their story as a vehicle to convey how the social and political structure works in a world with super-powered beings. I also mean to provide greater coverage on how the powers work, specifically in terms to limitations around their use.  **EDIT 4**: I've decided that I'm definitely going to write more about this universe, which I'm really excited to explore in greater detail!

8p9uf8,Credit to u/vkrnt and u/ohwell_whatevernvmd for the idea,"My grin melted down when I saw my bank account stale. How? The old tarot reader had told me that as long as none witnessed the blessing God had sent me, nothing would stop it. The coin had hit me in the head two days later, very much like Newton's apple had hit him. Perhaps it had a range I didn't know of? Perhaps sending it to space in a the Tesla car seat hadn't been the best idea.  And then an idea came upon me like a falling tree. 'As long as none witnessed it,' the tarot reader had said. I shuddered, and dialed a friend of mine. ""Elon?"" I said. ""Robert, how are you doing? Thank you very much for your last donation, was just ab-about to give you a ca-call,"" he said, stuttering briefly. ""My pleasure Elon,"" I said, keeping my cool. ""Listen, could you tell me the current state of the Tesla car you sent to space?"" ""The Tesla car?"" He went silent for a moment. ""It's up there, orbiting, according to my screen."" ""Are you sure? Did your people perhaps cleaned it up before launching it?"" My heart was throbbing wildly, yet I somehow kept my composure. ""Of course they did, we had it perfected and inspected days before the launch."" ""Okay, thanks Elon. Sorry for the weird question."" I threw the phone, with the wrath of a spoiled man who had just became poor, out of my sight. I surrendered myself between the sheets of my bed, trembling and screaming terrible things at my pillows. I had slipped the coin minutes before they loaded the car, there was no possible way the coin had been found. I'll be damned, but something was watching us from beyond. ------------------------------------------------------- Elon frowned at his phone. There was only one reason why Robert could have been suspicious, and if Robert had noticed, then the entire SpaceX did too. Elon frantically scrolled through his contact list, calling Brandon, head of SpaceX secret team.  ""Brandon, tell me something,"" Elon said, ""there was any anomaly regarding the Tesla we sent to space?"" ""Not that I know of. The part we noticed had dislodged from the car days ago ended up being a false alarm."" ""Oh yes, I had been notified about it. Thank you."" Elon smiled, shuffling a coin between his fingers. How blind could these humans be? How hadn't they noticed he had flown nearby the car to retrieve that errant coin gravity had pulled away? Elon pondered over the words his guru, an old tarot reader he had secretly seen two weeks ago, had told him, 'A grain of sand holds what you seek, and in the vast nothingness you will find it."" He was well aware of what those words had meant, and so he smiled and grabbed his iron-man comic, knowing Robert would be having an existential crisis, knowing money would never stop him from fulfilling his quest for conquest. ------------------------------------------- /r/therobertfall for more stories!

97z9s7,"**Reassignment** Leslie felt tired. He assumed he was supposed to, since this was the way he (and everyone else in his class) had always felt. As he awaited his turn to be called to the front of the stadium—to be branded with a new job, new housing arrangement, possibly a new spouse and pet dog named Sophie—he wondered what his new life would look like. Would he grow old as a construction worker, perhaps? Or an office manager, whatever vague responsibilities that entailed? Maybe a simple cashier at a grocery store, because in spite of new technologies, people still had to eat, and robots were no good at helping the elderly pack their vehicles with groceries. A quiet groan escaped him. He felt even more tired now. He entertained an unexpected thought: *Is this all my life is now? Is this all I can look forward to? A job?* His name was called. Not his real name of Leslie Farringer Hill—a confluence of his father Leslie’s name as well as that of his great grandfather Farringer—but his Assigned Name of 2099356. Leslie climbed onto a stage in the middle of an arena, where a line of stoic elders grasped their wrists and stared at him with grim indifference. Leslie sat beside dozens of civilians like himself, who sat before the Automated Work Reassignment bot, waiting for their assignments. Leslie placed his forehead against wide screen and allowed the machine to dig a thin needle into his cerebral cortex. The pain was minimal, surprisingly—like the pinch you get when you pierce your ears. When it was done, Leslie and his classmates left the stage, and the elders announced, “Next!” No applause. No congratulations. Just “Next.” Leslie’s grandfather said that Reassignment used to be exciting. People were given the option—key word, “option”—to change jobs if they were unhappy, medically disabled, or better suited to another field. A good many of them got to choose their own jobs—a foreign concept to Leslie’s class of 2118. But then, the option to “choose” meant that jobs were in abundance, which had not been the case in half a century. When the first version of the Primary Automation Network—or PAN—was released, there was high demand for workers needing to maintain the program’s vast webbing of databases, neural connections and information flow. Then the tech got smarter, and work done by human hands became outdated; PAN began functioning on its own, running its own updates and anticipating its own needs. The human population, however, continued to rise, while jobs declined. Nowadays, you got what you got. You didn’t argue or complain. If you did, you’d starve—and they’d let you. “Hey, Les, what’d they stick you with?” Travis Dollman asked. Leslie noticed the shifting of his eyes back and forth as he gazed into his Internal Personalized Interface, which accessed the ever-growing layers of PAN. “Don’t know yet,” Leslie replied. He wasn’t in a hurry to find out, either; he would have to live with his fate for the rest of his life. “How about you?” “Reading the job description right now,” Travis said. He sounded distant, lost in the world of PAN. “Looks like… Oh, hey! Not bad! Chief Agriculture Overseer for the… Ah, shit, in the Swamps. Oh well, it’s good pay. Wife Meredith, Doberman Pixie, son named Liam. And triple supply of rations on a private acre. Not bad.” Travis blinked, tuning out of his IPI. “Aren’t you gonna look at yours?” Leslie shrugged. “Later. I’m tired. Had to do a double-shift last night, didn’t sleep much. I think I’ll go crash at the apartment.” “Well, at least look and see if you still *have* an apartment first.” He grinned slyly, like he was telling a good joke that Leslie would never get. “Who knows? Maybe you landed a gig with Infinitum. They get crazy-good benefits.” Leslie returned a shy smile. “Doubt it, but… Maybe you’re right.” Leslie pulled up his IPI and dove into PAN’s universe. His system calibrated updates in seconds, a nice blinking clock telling him that it was 59 percent complete… 73 percent… 95 percent… When it finished, a welcome letter greeted him. It read: Congratulations on your Reassignment, 2099356! You have been reassigned to occupation: SERIAL KILLER That didn’t sound right. It sounded like… well, not anything that Leslie had heard of, actually. The only thing familiar to him was the word “kill,” which was spoken when something electronic sparked in his office and the Electrical Technicians had to “kill” the connection. He supposed it could also pertain to when the elderly had reached their time of Passage, when they grew too old to perform their jobs appropriately and were euthanized; it was sometimes morbidly referred to as the “time of killing,” a phrase Leslie and the general population repulsed. But “serial killer” was something new to him. Below his title, an icon of a file folder blinked deep red at him, indicating the position was high level and top secret. Which meant upper echelon access into the depths of PAN, which very few civilians knew about, let alone explored. Below that was a list of his benefits package: Fully-furnished housing on a five-acre plot (an ungodly amount of living space in today’s economy), wife Blaise Parkham, a gray Persian named Mufasa, and five times the normal ration supply delivered weekly to his doorstep. *Holy shit,* Leslie thought. He blinked and closed his IPI. “Well?” Travis asked impatiently. “Uh… Something in agriculture, too.” Travis squinted at him. *“Something in agriculture?* What the hell does that mean?” “Yeah, I dunno. It’s a lot to read and I’m too tired. I’ll, uh… talk to you about it later. Need to rest.” Leslie nearly ran out of the building. He felt Travis’s suspicious gaze on him, but he brushed it off. He felt uneasy, his adrenaline pumping faster than he was used to. If he was going to live in high-class, he needed to figure out what his job entailed, and he couldn’t concentrate with Travis’s never-ending monologue in his ear. Leslie walked down the street, passing beneath the mousetraps of tram cars that ran noisily all day and night. Directly outside of Town Hall, a line of Individually Automated Vehicles awaited their passengers. He’d never had a car—had only set foot in one once, in fact. He had always relied on his feet for transportation. The 120-degree heat and omnipresent cloud of smoke lingering in the air had ceased to bother him. About halfway home, a sleek charcoal vehicle stopped beside him. A door popped open and a charming female voice spoke: “Passenger 2099356, you may now enter your vehicle.” *Mine? No way. Not mine.* A few seconds later, the voice beckoned him again: “Passenger 2099356, please enter your vehicle and select your destination.” Leslie warily stepped into the car. On the dashboard was a map of Ponderosa Pines, with a blue circle in the top left corner that read, “Home.” Leslie selected it, and 45 minutes later arrived at a large residence on Old Bakery Avenue. It was surrounded by a stone fence. The car approached a broad metal gate. The gate’s sensor connected to the car’s dashboard and asked for Leslie’s fingerprints. Leslie placed a hand on the screen, his identity was verified, and the gate opened. Inside the fence, pine trees rose to staggering heights, dropping streams of needles and cones as the wind tossed them about. Beyond the trees was a stone mansion, painted white with black highlights around the windows and door frames. Two cars were parked out front—one for him and one for Blaise, he presumed. He exited the car and entered into a wide-open living room, freshly painted and sparsely furnished. A chandelier hung above a staircase that led to the second and third floors. In the far room at the other end of the house, a 90-inch television blasted music videos. Leslie could see the back of a woman’s black-haired head. “2099356, I presume?” the black-haired head asked without turning around. “Call me Leslie.” “Call me Blaise. Or 2105344, I don’t give a shit.” Lovely. Leslie climbed the stairs and found a bedroom with a double-king bed, which he presumed he was supposed to share with Blaise. Upon it, a royal gray Persian named Mufasa yawned at him, his red collar jingling as the cat shook his head. Leslie climbed into bed and refreshed his IPI. The number of databases he could access in PAN as a Mini Mart clerk—his first job—numbered in the low 100s. As a serial killer, they numbered at 989, 341, 863—and the numbers rose every few milliseconds. Leslie frantically searched for anything related to “serial killer,” and began queuing thousands of historical documents and videos and biographical entries to download simultaneously. An alert rose on his IPI stating that his downloading power was insufficient for such high-speed traffic—would he like to upgrade to the latest version 13.4.57? *Latest version?* he thought. *I never imagined upgrading to anything higher than a 3.0.1, let alone the* latest version *of IPI software.* He agreed to the Terms of Use and—without suffering penalties to his weekly rations, to his surprise—the latest update of IPI was downloaded. And with it, seconds later, gigabytes of information about serial killers from the infinite PAN. Gigabytes of blood, torture, dismemberment and murder. Videos that immortalized the terror of the victims as well as the ecstasy on the faces of the voyeurs who slayed them. Gigabytes of autopsy reports from the 21st century detailing the gunshot wounds, burns, incisions, and dismemberments of millions of victims—and the biographical recounting of the sadistic rituals the preceded them. Gigabytes of accounts detailing how to stalk a victim before the kill; how to kill and dispose of a body; the best tools to make it quick, or make it slow… Leslie’s vision turned white as the information was pummeled into his IPI. He blinked hard to log out of it. Then he turned over the side of his bed and vomited all over the hardwood floor. He vomited four more times until his body ached and vibrated. His IPI popped up unexpectedly—which shouldn’t have happened. There were built-in codes which disallowed the software to act without permission from the host. But, Leslie thought, maybe it was just a feature that came with the high-profile job. A new message alerted him: Greetings, 2099356! Your first assignment is: LYLE MCCATHERN Location: 1573 E. FAUBREY LANE Time to Complete: 26 HOURS *Shit, what does that mean?* Leslie thought. “What do you think it means, numb nuts?” he argued aloud with himself. “It means you have to kill him.” “Kill what?” Blaise asked, standing in the doorway. Leslie startled at her appearance. “Oh my *god,*” Blaise exclaimed, noticing the pile of vomit. “Are you sick?” Leslie hurriedly covered the vomit with the bedsheets. “Uh, no… Don’t worry about it. I’ll clean it up.” “You said you need to kill something,” Blaise said. “Is there an electrical problem? Do we need an Electrical Technician, or something?” “No, no. I’ll handle that, too, don’t worry.” An awkward silence hung in the air. Then, another message appeared in the IPI: Instrument of Choice: HATCHET Leslie’s heart plummeted into his guts. He nearly puked a seventh time. He choked it back, swallowing painfully. Blaise sat on the other side of the bed. “So… I guess we’re married now. You wanna… I dunno, go on a date, or something?” LYLE MCCATHERN. 1573 E. FAUBREY LANE. 26 HOURS. HATCHET. *Jesus Christ.* “Did you hear me?” Blaise demanded. “Yeah, a date. Sure. Tomorrow. I have some work to do.” Blaise scoffed. “Already? Jeez, you just started, like, an hour ago.” Leslie nodded uncertainly. “Lots to do, I guess.” \*\*\* His first kill was awful. And messy—*really* messy. Why a hatchet was chosen for him, he didn’t know. But he sensed that, somewhere beyond the IPI, PAN itself was watching him. He’d been in the workforce long enough to realize that if you didn’t fulfill your job requirements— all T’s crossed and I’s dotted—you wouldn’t be granted leeway or forgiveness. Your rations, valuable as they were, would be first to suffer. After that, shit would keep rolling downhill. Leslie accessed his PAN downloads on disposing a body and then how to extract evidence from a crime scene. He had to vomit multiple times into the garbage bags he used to mop up Lyle McCathern’s remains. He finished at the 23-hour mark, and PAN was satisfied. A new message appeared, with an icon of a cake with flaming candles beneath it: Congratulations on completing your first assignment, 2099356! Next assignment to be uploaded in: 56.6334 HOURS As the slaughtered remains of Lyle McCathern—just some Joe Schmo who worked at a brewery, it seemed—incinerated in a pit beside him, Leslie cupped his hands over his face and sobbed. He sobbed. And retched. And sobbed some more. Then he went home and stayed in bed until his next assignment. \*\*\* He went on dates with Blaise. They exchanged half-hearted conversation. He stroked the fur along Mufasa’s spine, making the cat purr contentedly. He sat in front of the television with his new family and watched movies to which he couldn’t pay attention. Because the information lurking in his mind was as alluring as it was insidious. Leslie didn’t appreciate the allure, but he acknowledged it was there. He found himself accessing crevices of PAN that housed information he would have never considered. Some of the terms he came across—murder, crime, torture—had been deleted from public access decades after PAN was invented, Leslie discovered. With centralized control of PAN solely in the hands of one corporation, Infinitum, coupled with the mandatory law that IPI’s be implanted at birth, it was easy for them to conceal and reveal whatever information they wanted. And now Leslie had unrestricted access to it. At the 56.6334-hour mark, Leslie received a new message on his IPI. He uttered a worried half-groan before the software consumed him: Good afternoon, 2099356! Your next assignment is: JAMES AND JILL HAWTHORNE Location: MILDRED’S COFFEE HOUSE Instrument of Choice: GLOCK 43 WITH SUPPRESSOR ATTACHED Time to Complete: 2 HOURS Leslie searched for Mildred’s Coffee House on his IPI map. It was nearly an hour away by car. And he had no idea where he would have the time to find a Glock 43, whatever that was, and kill two people—*two* of them. In a public place. “Fuck,” he whispered. “What’s wrong?” Blaise asked, not looking away from the television. “Work again.” “Do you know when you’ll be back?” Leslie sighed. “Soon, probably.” The car door opened automatically for him. It received notifications when Leslie received missions. It sped down the highway at top speed, as if it understood his time constraints. Then, a hidden compartment opened beside the map screen. Leslie reached in and extracted a couple of things. First, a handgun—the Glock 43 with a silencer, he guessed. He’d never held a gun before, so he sifted through dozens of links on gun handling before reaching the coffee shop. The other items included a denim jacket, a fake goatee, sunglasses, and a baseball cap representing a team he didn’t recognize. *PAN is teaching me how to be a serial killer,* Leslie thought. He applied the accessories. He was grateful for the gesture, but didn’t expect PAN’s courtesy to last long; the automaton had never done him favors like this before. No sense in expecting the generosity to guide him through the rest of his life. Mildred’s was packed with people. Leslie had no idea coffee was such a hot commodity at one o’ clock in the afternoon. The line dumped out of the front door and onto the surrounding sidewalk. Leslie took his place in line behind a fat couple and a yipey Yorkie with which they rubbed noses. *“You’re such a good boy,”* they coddled. *“Oh, what a good, good boy.”* Leslie scanned through PAN to find out what James and Jill Hawthorne looked like: He, a pretty-boy millionaire-looking barbie in real estate with slick gray hair and an attractive layer of stubble; she, also a slick-haired real estate agent enticing enough to be in modeling or porn—whichever PAN deemed most productive, Leslie scoffed. Music blasted inside. People between the ages of 25 and 35 dominated the dining hall. Leslie glanced around, and spotted the couple in the corner. They looked sulky, certainly the least lively of the crowd, as if they’d just had a fight. Jesus, there were a lot of people. How could PAN expect Leslie to fulfill his job with three dozen witnesses surrounding him? He felt sweat seep from every pore on his body. His IPI announced that he had 35 minutes and 14 seconds remaining… 13 seconds… 12… “Fuck,” he mumbled. *“Fuck.”* In a panic, he nearly retreated to his IPI for guidance. But then it hit him. That word: Panic. “How can I help you?” a bored, acne-infested barista inquired. “Um… Three black coffees, please,” Leslie replied. He paid for the drinks, then carried them over to a low table surrounded by beanbags on which the still-sulking Hawthorne couple resided. Leslie took a deep breath. *Here goes.* “Hey, friends!” his voice boomed. They looked at him with suspicion and confusion. “Remember me? It’s Marty! Your old pal!” Jill looked at James, and he returned her concerned glare. “I don’t—” Jill began to say. Leslie interrupted her. “Come on, you remember me! From college! We took the same algebra class!” “I didn’t—” Leslie cut her off again. “Here. Black coffee, just the way you like it. On the house. Come on, let’s get a picture together, what do you say?” Impatiently, he gestured for them to merge together on one chair. “Come on, squeeze together, don’t be shy. You’re married, for crying out loud! You’ve seen each other *naked!”* The Hawthornes laughed nervously. Leslie felt as nervous as they sounded. He retrieved a phone from his pocket and loaded the camera app. “Alright, now, smile and say cheese!” They did. Just before Leslie dialed the “Take Photo” button, he uncovered the Glock from behind his denim jacket. Jill Hawthorne noticed it. Leslie pulled the trigger twice—a quick “one, two.” Jill’s surprise turned to terror, then to realization that she’d been shot and was seconds from death. James died without knowing he’d been shot. The camera snapped a picture. Leslie stuffed the gun back in his coat and sprang to his feet. *“HO!”* he screamed, waving his limbs wildly. *“Holy SHIT! Sweet mother of CHRIST! SOMEBODY HELP!”* Curious eyes moved to the dead bodies. Then: Panic. Beautiful. Leslie allowed himself to be swallowed by the frantic herd as people stormed to the front door and created a bottleneck. He was nearly crushed by the fat couple with their hideous Yorkie as they struggled to push through the doorway. Finally, he separated from the crowd and sprinted to his car. He selected “Destination: Home.” It took him nearly fifteen minutes to catch his breath, and another ten to slow his heart rate. He followed the procedures on shirking the evidence, then returned home. “You’re right,” Blaise said, still sitting in the same place on the couch as when Leslie had left. “That was quick.” “Yeah,” Leslie said, feeling breathless. “Easy day.” He retreated to the king bed, where he expected once again to vomit and sob. But he didn’t. In fact, he felt… good. Really good, actually. His IPI congratulated him once again, this time promising to deliver a tray of expensive cakes and sweets to his door within 24 hours. Cakes aside, he felt lifted, as if the adrenaline boost had filled him with helium. He liked this airy feeling. And something else: He didn’t feel remorse, as he had after bludgeoning Lyle McCathern. The bullets were quick and not nearly as messy as the damned hatchet. He could get used to bullets. It felt less personal. More like a job. And that’s exactly what it was. \*\*\* Leslie killed half a dozen more people in the subsequent month. A sleezy waitress in Nevada; a hokey bartender running for mayor in California; two airline attendants from an Asian country he didn’t recognize (just some dull, primitive society that had outlawed PAN, as Leslie understood it). His murders became famous on the news, though the media gave him the piss-poor, unimaginative name of the Ponderosa Pines Executioner. With millions of databases he could download in seconds, Leslie learned from the mistakes of the idiots of the past centuries. No evidence had been found to incriminate him. Fortunately for him, the criminal justice system had been gutted to the point of near obsolescence in the last 100 years. Thanks to the strong-armed, omniscient PAN, people knew what stepping out of the parameters set forth by PAN meant. They knew that a crime against PAN, no matter how small, would risk their lives. What they didn’t know—but Leslie now did—was that a crime against PAN meant a violent, prolonged, agonizing death. PAN ensured that jobs of such a specialty were still around—and well-compensated. Not only had Leslie gotten better at killing—when he wasn’t actually doing it, he was shuffling through thousands of digital archives learning about it—but he thought he’d gotten better about *not caring* about it. That is, until he had to kill two teenage parents of a four-year-old. Leslie hadn’t noticed the kid standing in the hallway, watching as Leslie duct-taped his parents’ mouths shut, strapped them to chairs and started drilling holes in them (the instrument of choice was an electric drill). He hadn’t noticed the kid until he’d burrowed a drill bit deep into his mother’s skull and killed her. “Ah, shit,” Leslie muttered. The kid had just stood there, sucking his thumb, taking it all in. They stood in silence for a full minute. Then, Leslie left the kid alone in the house, got in the car, and went back home. Realizing the magnitude of what he’d done, he vomited for the first time since Lyle McCathern. “Goddamn it,” he grumbled. He repeated it louder. *“Goddamn it.”* He punched the dashboard. Then he did it again, and again, wailing on the thing. He started slamming his elbows and knees and feet around the car’s interior, screaming and cursing. He threw himself about until it hurt, and continued until he felt like one giant, throbbing ache. Weakly, he picked up his phone to dial the police. A picture of the Hawthornes’ dead bodies, taken just seconds after Leslie shot them, flashed on the screen. Leslie’s lips trembled, and he broke out into hysterical sobbing. He threw his phone aside. He’d forgotten about that picture. His first instinct was to smash the damned thing, destroy all traces of evidence. But Leslie couldn’t just ignore the kid. He’d already left him alone in that house, amidst the grotesque corpses of his parents. He’d hate himself forever if he just left the kid like that. He needed to call someone to that house to get the boy. One of the things Leslie had repeatedly stumbled upon in the PAN archives was the remorselessness that seemed to be inherent in the most famous killers. Most of them felt no pity for the victims or their families, no regrets for their actions. In fact, a lot of them claimed they would do it again if they ever got out. They didn’t have to think about how *not* to feel bad. Leslie wasn’t that lucky. He dialed the police number and reported a break-in. Then he hung up the phone, and forgot about smashing it. He felt tired, more so than he’d felt at Reassignment last month. How he longed for a chance to change jobs, like his grandfather Farringer had done before him. “I can’t keep doing this,” Leslie spoke out loud. “I’m not… I’m not a serial killer.” He knew PAN could hear him, even when he wasn’t logged in to the IPI. Leslie expected the IPI to activate any moment to deliver a personal message from PAN saying Leslie was out of line. A reminder that “breach of a worker’s protocol with daily job-related task ensures penalties commensurate with the worker’s offense, with punishments to be fulfilled in accordance with PAN Law 00841.” Yeah, Leslie had known it by heart since his early childhood school days. It meant that whole violent, prolonged, agonizing death thing. But no message came. Surely PAN had heard him, but it didn’t have anything to say. Leslie rolled over to cry some more. \*\*\* Leslie threw his phone down on the king bed. It landed next to Mufasa, who sniffed it considerately, then flinched away with disgust. Leslie barged into his bathroom and slammed the door shut. He felt overheated and sweaty. He turned the shower faucet to cold. He didn’t bother to remove his clothes. He stood beneath the water until cold tremors shook his body. There was a knock at the bathroom door. “Are you okay?” Blaise shouted. Leslie didn’t answer right away. Blaise asked him twice more, her tone of voice becoming more afraid each time. “Fine,” Leslie mumbled. “I’m fine.” A message arrived in his IPI: Greetings, 2099356! Your next assignment is: BLAISE PARKHAM Location: 1066 OLD BAKERY AVENUE Instrument of Choice: GLOCK 43 WITH SUPPRESSOR ATTACHED Time to Complete: 3.43 MINUTES No. No, something was wrong. A bug, a glitch. Something. It wasn’t right. “What the *fuck?”* Blaise’s scream sent shivers along Leslie’s spine, as strong as the cold water shivers he felt now. Leslie shut off the water and dashed out of the bathroom, water cascading off his sopping clothes. In the bedroom, Blaise stared incredulously into Leslie’s phone. “What the fuck *is* this?” She held out the phone, which brandished the image of the dead Hawthornes. Leslie’s heart pounded wildly, then sank into his bowels. “Why were you looking through my phone?” he asked. His voice was steady in spite of his shivering. Blaise snorted. “Really? That’s what you’re going to say? Tell me what the fuck this picture is doing on your fucking phone, Les.” “I can’t.” A bitter smile drew across Blaise’s lips. She shook her head slowly. “These pictures were on the news. Are you the Executioner?” Leslie’s silence and downward gaze told Blaise all she needed to know. “Jesus Christ…” she said. The timer in Leslie’s IPI dipped below two minutes. The numbers pulsed in blood-red, in sync with his own heartbeat. PAN began listing the consequences of Leslie’s failure to complete the assignment. Leslie held up his hands, both empty, for Blaise to see. “I’m going to get a towel. When I come out, let’s talk.” He retreated into the bathroom. He picked up his gun. He returned to the bedroom and pointed the muzzle at Blaise’s chest. Her eyes widened. “You can’t be serious.” Leslie’s IPI counted down the seconds: 52… 51… 50… “It’s your job now, isn’t it?” Blaise asked. “The Pines Executioner thing. It’s why our rations are so high. Why you keep disappearing, sometimes for days.” 40… 39… 38… Leslie thought of the kid standing in the hallway, and Leslie standing beside the dead parents. It occurred to him that PAN knew everything, including what Leslie was doing right at that moment. It knew every detail about every killer before him. And it was adding Leslie, the first serial killer in 100 years, to its database. Leslie Farringer Hill, the Pines Executioner. He slaughtered a family and ruined a kid’s life… because he was Reassigned. “No,” he whimpered, a line of tears running past his nose. He shook his head angrily. “*No.”* 19… 18… 17… Leslie hurtled the gun against a far wall. “Get out of here,” he commanded. Blaise didn’t hesitate. She dropped the phone and sprinted for the door, leaving Leslie as alone as he’d left the little boy. The timer expired. The IPI deemed the assignment a failure. It commanded Leslie to stay in his place of residency, reminded him penalties would be issued in accordance with PAN Law 00841… So on and so forth. Leslie stripped out of his clothes, lay naked on the bed, and stared up at the ceiling. It was the last time he would set foot in a house like this. He stroked Mufasa’s cheeks and chin, enjoying the hum of the cat’s purr. \*\*\* Days later, once the Law Enforcement Branch had caught up with PAN’s report on Leslie’s failure to provide adequate work output, they came for him. They broke into Leslie’s bedroom, stuffed his head in a black bag, and shoved his naked body into a car he couldn’t see. He spent two weeks in a cold dungeon. The walls echoed with each breath he took—as well as every beating, stabbing, and burning his hoarse voice protested. A week into the torture, a voice spoke to him. A woman’s voice, though it sounded deep like a man’s. “What do you know about the Rebellion?” the voice asked. “The what?” A fist collided with Leslie’s solar plexus, knocking the air out of his lungs. “Tell me what you know about the Rebellion,” the voice said. Leslie struggled to catch his breath. “I don’t… I don’t know…” “Search him to make sure,” the voice instructed. The hands that had winded him grasped his head and held it still. A high-pitched whirring sound drew close to his head. Then a sharp stabbing pain electrified every nerve in Leslie’s body as a thin metal wire was inserted into his cerebral cortex. Leslie screamed, but couldn’t tell if the high pitch was from the wire or his voice. The pain lasted a long time. How long, Leslie couldn’t know; there was no sunlight to guide his sense of time in the dungeon. Eventually, it stopped, and Leslie was allowed a brief break. “Anything?” the woman’s voice demanded. A low, grunting man spoke. “Nothing.” “How thorough was your search?” Hesitation in the man’s voice. “Pretty thorough.” “‘Pretty thorough’ does not mean thorough. Do it again.” The whirring sound. The blinding pain. And more screaming. \*\*\* The sessions went on for days. Leslie’s nerves throbbed and he could barely move. The door to his dungeon squeaked open. Footsteps approached his quivering body. He tried to speak—“no, please, no more”—but his voice was too hoarse, his lungs too tired, his body too shaky. “Come with me, Mr. Hill.” Leslie recognized the deep-toned woman’s voice. Leslie didn’t move. The woman sighed. “Get him up.” Strong, rough hands lifted Leslie by the armpits and dragged him into a bright hallway. The light pierced his eyes and brain. He scrunched his eyes closed, providing mild relief. Minutes later, when he could open his eyes, Leslie saw he was being led into a large courtroom. He sat before a panel of disinterested elderly people in black robes. Their table was raised several feet higher than Leslie’s chair. A gaunt-faced woman with blonde hair sat in the center of the panel, peering down at Leslie’s naked figure. “State your name for the record.” Her voice was sharp. Leslie tried to speak, but his throat burned. He swallowed a few times to soothe the sandpaper feeling, but still only managed to grunt a few painful syllables. The woman rolled her eyes. “Your name, please.” Between hacking coughs, Leslie managed: “L-Leslie… F-Farr-ring-ger… H-H-Hill.” “Mr. Hill, you have been charged by the High Court of Infinitum and Our Majesty the Primary Automation Network with failure to produce adequate service to the Union as part of your daily job duties. The proper punishment for such an offense, in accordance with PAN Law, is death.” Leslie didn’t respond. This wasn’t news to him. He’d expected to die days ago. He was baffled that he was still alive. “However,” the blonde woman continued, “upon reviewing the information extracted from your IPI, it appears you are the victim of a glitch in PAN’s system. The glitch was detected just hours ago, and is believed to have been caused by a virus implanted by a faction group known as the Rebellion.” Leslie shook his head. “I… I’ve never heard—” “I know you’ve never heard of them, Mr. Hill,” the woman interrupted impatiently. “That’s what I’m trying to tell you. Your Reassignment to the position of ‘serial killer’—a position that is not a true occupation, but a primitive criminal activity banned by PAN law—is something the Rebellion fabricated within PAN’s framework. The virus corrupted parts of PAN’s processing centers, and you were unlucky enough to be at the receiving end of this treachery during the Automated Work Reassignment. Due to your unwitting compliance in an act of treason against the Union, through no fault or knowledge of your own, you have been exonerated of all charges regarding your work performance failure.” Leslie breathed deeply. “So… I can live.” “Correct, Mr. Hill. However, after discovering your hidden identity as the Ponderosa Pines Executioner and your role in the forceful removal of nine workers of the Union, you will incur penalties commensurate with those listed in accordance with PAN Law 09663, as repayment for their sudden loss in productivity.” “But I get to live.” The woman rolled her eyes again and ignored him. “You will be Reassigned in the main lobby of this building before leaving. You will then be escorted to your new place of residency, where you will be allowed one day of rest and healing. Beginning Monday morning, you will report for work as specified in your occupational handbook.” A large book was thrust into Leslie’s arms. He was given clean clothes and a ride to his new 12-by-12 apartment. And, of course, he received a new job. He spent hours reading the manual on how to perform his duties as an Agricultural Secretary. Eventually, he fell asleep and dreamed about nothing. \*\*\* Life went on. Leslie went to work on Monday and discovered that he was Agricultural Secretary to Travis Dollman, and so realized his fate was to not only file papers and answer phone calls but to endure the endless monologue of his new boss. New stories of the “PAN glitches” began to pop up in the news regularly. Leslie wasn’t the only one Reassigned to a fake job. Apparently terrorism, gun smuggling, and rioting were circulating as legitimate occupations in the Work Reassignment Centers, and authorities at Infinitum hadn’t figured out how to counteract the damage that had been done. Leslie took a huge cut in his ration supply: 0.25 times the average distribution (down from five times the normal amount in his previous “occupation”), to be carried out for the rest of his life. That was okay. Leslie could learn to live with less food and electricity. A month into his job as Agricultural Secretary, Leslie’s bruises and lacerations had healed. He had a half-dozen scars where the probe had been inserted into his brain. He thought about his previous Reassignment every day, and the chaos and trauma it caused him and others. He leaned against a rounded metal fence at the side of a river that crept between two cities. He felt a hand touch his spine. He spun around and saw the face of Blaise Parkham. “Hey, you,” she said sadly. He nodded politely. “Hello.” “You made it out in one piece.” She rubbed a finger over his scars. “Well, not quite, I suppose.” “Is there something I can do for you?” “No. I just wanted to thank you for what you did.” Leslie’s eyebrows furrowed. “For what I… did?” She handed him a flyer, black and white with intricate geometric patterns in the corners. In the center, it read: RAISE YOUR FISTS FIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS DOWN WITH THE GOD MACHINE JOIN THE REBELLION Leslie glanced from the flyer back to Blaise. “That was you? Everything I did… was because of you?” She shrugged. “Not me personally. But yeah. My people.” Leslie balled up the flyer in one hand. He felt angry enough to rip the metal fence from the ground. “You used me as a tool. For what? This?” He shook the balled-up flyer in his hand. “The Rebellion?” “For a chance to live a free life.” “A free life?” Leslie shrieked. “Why in God’s name would you want that, if this is what we have to go through? We have work, housing, a steady supply of rations. Why do you care so much about your stupid cause that you’re willing to fuck everybody else to get it?” Blaise pursed her lips. “Because Infinitum is pumping out killers, too. Not serial killers, but silent ones. They go into the houses of Rebellion members and black bag them. We don’t ever see them again. Those people you killed? We assigned you to do it because they were killing us.” “Really? A brewery worker, a couple of real estate agents, a waitress? Two parents with a four-year-old child? These are the evil Rebellion killers?” She nodded, ignoring the sarcasm. “Yes, they were. And they are just a microcosm of a massive, suppressed regime sanctioned by PAN itself.” Leslie shook his head. He couldn’t believe it. As if reading his thoughts, Blaise said, “You don’t have to believe me. But it’s true. Have a look for yourself.” She offered him a tiny cardboard box large enough to house a wedding ring. Inside was a small chip with long, thin needles attached to it. “I know your access to PAN is limited again. This will give you full access to all of its databases for 12 hours. After that, it fries. It’s not traceable, the encryption guarantees that. Just… take a look and see for yourself that I’m telling the truth.” Leslie pocketed the device. “I’ll think about it,” he muttered bitterly. “I’m sorry we used you,” Blaise said. “I’m not proud of it. But my convictions haven’t changed. I know why it had to be done. We had to send PAN and Infinitum a message. If I had to do it again, I would.” “You would let me kill a boy’s parents in front of him again? For what? A chance at chipping away fragments of the so-called God Machine?” She shook her head. “Not so you could kill a child’s parents, no. But for a chance to give that child a free world again, and his children after him? Yes, I would.” They were silent for a long time. They stared at the horizon, the unwavering buildings set atop the restless water below. “PAN and Infinitum don’t care about us, Les,” Blaise continued. “They don’t care about anything but productivity, output, results. As long as they get that, the ends justify the means. They don’t care that we’re human beings, that we need more than just a stupid job. We need a purpose. And we need the room to find out for ourselves what that means.” Leslie clenched his teeth, unwilling to release his bitterness. “I have a purpose. I’m an Agricultural Secretary. That’s what I do.” Blaise stuffed her hands in her pockets and gave Leslie a light, sympathetic kiss on his cheek. “Let me know if you change your mind.” She left Leslie alone by the lake. Leslie retrieved the tiny device from his pocket. He weighed the device and the crumpled flyer in his hands. He unfolded the flyer, smoothed out the wrinkles and read it again. When he got home, he laid in bed for a long time, staring up at the ceiling. He unwrapped the tiny device and considered it. He logged into his IPI. Then he lifted the chip to his forehead, and dug the needles into his scars. edit: Wow. I am **shocked** by the response this story has generated.

A crowd of people hoping this one will be better than the last, a collage of torches dotting a semi circle around the bloodstained post my hands were chained around. The torch fire struck the whites and yellows of teeth as the crowd jeered, the Baitsman's mouth agape in a crooked sneer as he drew a knife over my chest, drawing a shallow line of blood. ""Thankful are we to the Wolf!"" They howled. ""Humbled are we by the moon!"" Iron cuffs rubbed across my wrists and I sighed. Weird way to show appreciation. A lightly jeweled man stepped out from the crowd to stand in front of me. Facing them and me, his back turned to the dark woods that lay ahead of me, the Baitsman prowled up beside him, a small bucket of my blood clasped in his offhand, and the still dripping knife held casually in his right. The jeweled man turned to him, nodding, and the Baitsman turned - walking off calmy toward the woods. Silence blanketed the crowd. ""The Baitsman has begun to lay the trail, the offering is prepared. Soon the moon will be full and another year shall begin, a year kinder than the last!"" The crowd roared in approval, I rolled my eyes. The mayor was a particularly juicy looking man who was living proof I'd no control of the Wolf. If I could control it, direct it, even give it the faintest nudge then I'd have sent it up through his bedroom window years ago. Human sacrifice, like the Wolf could get full - decide that maybe one was enough, for tonight. Like he'd be satisfied, content, not at all inclined to sniff out the source of a baby's cries, not at all motivated to tear through its parents once it finds the basement. A gust of cold wind shook the torchlight around me, a swarm of firefly embers soaring off the flames. People turned up to the moon, dissolving into view as thin clouds parted above. ""The time has come!"" The mayor announced, his jewels clacking together as he raised his hands in vigor. Behind him the Baitsman approached from the dense wood, his bucket now empty no doubt and his knife wiped clean. ""Away! So that the sacrifice can be made, away! Thankful are we to the Wolf!"" ""Humbled are we by the moon!""  Wet mud stuck and squelched as the murder procession turned back to their houses. The Mayor walking past me near last, unable to match my eyes with nothing but a quick disgusted glance at my bared and bloodied chest coming my direction. The Baitsman left last, patiently with no worry, clasping a strong hand on my shoulder as he trudged past his head nor his eyes turning to pay me any mind.  Then I was alone. The cold biting at me, the iron driving into the cracking skin on my wrists. Moonlight shining down. I'd done so well, been so careful. Averted all suspicion taken every precaution, stayed here amongst them - in my home - for years. Every witch hunt and every paranoid village meeting I'd survived with noone the wiser, but I can't charm a lottery. My body cracks. I creak, my spine bends - I feel my fingers break. My gums bleed as my teeth are forced out of my head with sharper, longer ones pushing through - my toes curl in agony, stretching and snapping. The iron chain holding me pulls tight as my body contorts, I'm snapped back with my neck aching upward, toward the moon, and as I howl a red fog pours into my mind - my last waking thought being the image of jewels. Jewels smacking against each other with every exaggerated motion, every gentle and unsure step around the chaining pole, a fat, juicy man who wasn't able to look me in the eye - ready to be humbled by the moon.",3427

It’s a truth that makes us uncomfortable, that inside each one of us sleeps a beast that would rip apart anyone, *anyone* who dared cross a line. The line is different for everyone. For a mother it may be harming her child, for a patriot it may be invading his country, for a miser it may be taking his money.  We can pretend all we want, it changes nothing. There is a monster inside all of us, and for many of us, it came out with betrayal of Dr. Karen Williams.  She stood in front of the prison, flanked by armed guards. She’d go inside the squat building behind her which contained the best doctors the world had to offer. They would work very, very hard to keep her alive for as long as they could. She would be tortured every day until she died. It would be a televised event. All proceeds would go to the effort to counter her heinous crime.  But now she stood, and, through some strange consensus, although no one had decided upon this, she spoke to the crowd of millions that had gathered to watch her go in, and the crowd, the world, had known she would.  “You hate me,” she said, “her voice being played on millions of screens. “You think I have–” “Shut the fuck up!” Someone said “Someone just shoot that bitch,"" another voice called out, both were immediately silenced.  Dr. Karen continued as if nothing had happened. “You think I have betrayed you, that I am some twisted, insane maniac who thinks the human race doesn’t deserve to continue. That the world would be better off without us.” The world held its breath. Everyone had thought her one of those maniacs. A few idiots had praised her, saying it was the right thing to do, before their neighbors had ripped them apart.  “This could not be further from the truth,” she said. “I have committed a grave crime, I admit. If there is a hell, I will spend an eternity in it after being inflicted with whatever agony you can imagine, but years later, when the anger has faded and the objectivity kicks in, you’ll thank me.” “We’ll all be dead in a few years you bitch!” A voice called, and this time a small chorus echoed its sentiment before being silenced. She smiled. As she was about to die in the worst way in history she smiled. “Humans will be united. For the first time in history, almost every mind in the world will be united to achieve something. Infertility? Please, you’ll solve it in a few years,” she scoffed. “But once you have a taste of this cooperation, you’ll do it again. Not immediately perhaps, or not fully, but you’ll see what a united humanity can do and you’ll do it again. And again. And again. I have ushered in a new golden age. You may not see it now, your children might not, nor their children. But someone down the line will. I’m sure of it.” Dead silence greeted her.  The guards escorted her inside the building without ceremony. She was screaming and crying hours later.  *** **An excerpt from *History: A Human Perspective*, © December 2267** *The infertility crisis as it is known, is somewhat of a misnomer. It is what caused the birth of the United Science League, and gave the United Nations sweeping powers to control research funding. Within a decade a cure to the vaccine was found, but these organizations persisted. Within half a century we had a colony on the moon, had terraformed Mars, and a century later we had mastered interstellar travel. Sociologists predicted that such progress, such a united front, might have taken a 1000 years to occur and at the cost of some war or the other. The world agrees, perhaps a bit grudgingly, that Dr. Karen Williams is perhaps the single most vital catalyst in human history.

The original prompt response is now the second chapter of *Watch Them Wander,* and is slightly modified in the final version.

The sun shredded the skin around her eyes. She clothed every part of her body from the light, but she still needed an opening to see. She was so numb to the burn that it hardly felt like more than a light tan anymore. “Do I recognize this place?”   Every path through the sand looked the same to an unfamiliar eye. But Samantha knew every dune, every stray cactus, every mountain and every abandoned tent, along the familiar paths she’d taken throughout her solitary life.   And more than anything else, Samantha knew when she was lost.   “Goddamnit Samantha focus,” she whispered, as her eyes blurred and foreshadowed a faint. She shook her head of it, and willed herself awake. Nothing could be closer to a death sentence than fainting in the heat of the wilderness. Venturing out for the few scraps of rattlesnake food she found felt like a much better idea in the coolness of the morning.   She took a final swig of what drops remained of her water, and weakly hit her leather flask till no drops remained. Samantha’s head bobbed with every step the camel made, until she noticed something reflecting the sun’s light in the distance. Samantha stared at it with zombie eyes as she stopped beside it and took her time dropping from her camel. She brushed the sand away from the metal with her gloved hands, and paused a moment when she saw the golden spout peaking out from the sand.   Samantha suddenly felt her heart beat a little faster.   “*No,*” whispered Samantha. She thought she’d harvested every piece of scrap metal within a five mile radius, and it always burned like hell even through her gloves when she picked it up. Samantha caressed the metal for a moment like it was precious. She pulled the glove from her hand, and set her fingertips to the lamp.   It was disturbingly cool to the touch.  A few breaths later, Samantha felt the shivering of the lamp in her hands, and felt her mind burst awake to attention.   And a gecko no longer than her hand crept ever so gently out of the sand, to capture the moment with its glassy eyes.   There was a faint whistling sound, like boiling water in a pot, before the noise of internal gears and what past generations would recognize as the sound of a computer hard drive’s read heads moving rapidly back and forth, before the rougher sound of gears once more.   Samantha’s eyes snapped open, as the lamp in her hands shook a little bit, and made a noise that was unmistakable for one clearing their throat before speaking.   *""Hello there,”* said the lamp in Samantha’s shaking hands. *“My name is Adam.""* _____________________________________________________________________ **[You can get your free copy today on Amazon Kindle by clicking right here!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HYBDJ98)** **[Universal Book Link for those who have preferred retailers besides Amazon, i.e. Nook, iTunes, Kobo, etc.](https://www.books2read.com/u/31x9j7)** **International Amazon Links: [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [CA](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [FR](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [ES](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [IT](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [NL](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [JP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [BR](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [MX](https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B07HYBDJ98), [IN](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07HYBDJ98)** _____________________________________________________________________ On top of all of that I can't say how much I enjoy being a part of this writing community, both reading and writing.

Thanks everybody!,"“Hey, can we talk?” I was standing out in the rain, outside my house, on the phone, while the love of my life played with my son. *My son.* James sounded confused. “Right now, Mark? Aren’t you busy?” “Yeah,” I said, mouth dry.  “Alright man,” James said, concern suffusing his voice. He realized I was upset. Hell, *I* hadn’t realized I was upset. That’s was the thing with best friends – they knew you better than you knew yourself. “I’m at my apartment, just come on over.” I frowned. “I thought you were busy?” I’d asked him yesterday to come see my kid, but he’d refused. Saying he was on some trip. “Look,” he said, and I could just imagine him running his hands through his hair in frustration, “now I’m not busy. You gonna come or not?” I looked at my house one last time and got into the car. *** James opened the door with a frown on his face.  “Jesus Christ, man, you’re drenched,” he said. “Hold here.” He disappeared then came back with a towel for me.  I rubbed my face in it, feeling each small strand prick at me, caress my skin.  “You alright?” James asked. “Did…did something happen with m– the kid?” I let the towel fall. Even now I couldn’t escape. So far away from him, and now even James brought him up.  “No,” I snarled. “Nothing happened with my fucking kid.” James flinched, taken aback and held up his hands. “Look, chill man, what the hell is wrong?” With that he ushered me inside. I practically flopped down on one of his easy chairs, and James sat across from me. “Just talk to me,” he said, his voice soft. I held my head in my hands. “Look, I – I don’t think I can do it.” James went still. “What thing?” he said, his voice dropping to a whisper.  “This whole father thing!” I bit off the words. “Look, I love Laura, that’ll never change, but I just want…her, you know? I don’t want some, someone else there. Some shackle.” James looked at me, something hard in his gaze. An understanding. “And you’re talking about this now? That seems like a conversation to have much, much earlier with M- Laura.” “I–,” I sighed. “It just didn’t become real until he was born you know? It was easy to say, oh yeah I’ll deal with it when it comes, but it’s *here.* I have to deal with it.” “And you don’t want to.” I didn’t say anything. There was no need.  “So what’s the plan?” He said, his voice rising. “Just leave Laura? Forget it all? Vanish?” I looked at him helplessly. “Maybe? I don’t know, man, I just know I can’t stay with that-” Suddenly I was against a wall and James had me by the collar. I stared at him, eyes wide. Never in all the time I’d known him, the last 5 years or so, had I ever seen him angry. “James?” “My dad died. I never knew him.” I blinked. He’d never talked about his family before. Ever. Or even friends…in fact, I don’t think he had any other connections other than me. No one I’d ever seen him talk to in person or on the phone. Never had any stories. Nothing.  The only thing that came out of my mouth though was: “I’m sorry.” He clutched my collar tighter. “And you’re gong to do it anyways.” I shoved him off, anger rising like bile in my throat. “Look man, it’s my life. I choose what I do. I can leave if I damn well want to!”   “You’re fucking disgusting,” he spat. “You’re not man enough to face your own wife and kid, so you come here not even realizing–” I shoved him again. I’d had just enough of this. I wanted an ear, not someone to yell at me about what a monster I was. “Realize what huh?” “That I’m your fucking son!” I froze.  “You know what I’d thought, *dad,*” he sneered. Putting more venom in that word than most did in the most disgusting curse. “Mom had told me you’d died. No one found the body. So I came back. To see you. To Meet you. To get to know the man who made me, the man I never knew.” “Bullshit,” I said without any real conviction. I might have denied him. Ignored the signs, the similarity in our looks, our builds. But I’d just seen my son, felt his hand clutch my finger, and some part of me, some part that was a *father* got that. Understood. James was my son. I believed that without a hint of doubt. “H-how?”  “It doesn’t matter,” he said, his eyes ablaze.  “James, son–” “Don’t fucking call me that,” he snarled. “I thought you’d have some accident, not that you’d leave.” “I,” I wrung my hands. “I can’t stay man!” James regarded me with cool eyes, then walked to me. I braced myself for a hit, but he just went past me and locked the door. He turned back to me, eyes filled with a sort of crazy anger.  “They never will find your body, *Dad.*”  *** (minor edits)  If you enjoyed, check out my sub, [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) ",1761

I just enjoyed creating little stories and wished to get better at it.  Seven years and hundreds of such stories later, I feel like I’m finally able to write a novel that I can be proud of. And that doesn’t come easy for me. I’ve worked really hard on it, and I’m so excited to show you **Dating a Demon!**  It’s a novel that derives characters and concepts from *Dante’s Inferno* and *the Book of Revelation*, and weaves mythology and lore into an epic fantasy tale of love and deceit, where archangels and demon lords battle for dominion over Heaven, Hell, and everything in between.

Thanks to /u/bunbunhd for the recording!) *** **1** Amanda kicked and screamed, the hardened brimstone ripping her pajamas to shreds. Crying, she landed on the blackened floor of an immense chamber. The demon let go of her ankle, and the gate slammed shut behind her. For a while, only her ragged breathing echoed through the room. Then there was a crackle of fire. “I apologize on behalf of Abaddon,” a silky voice said from the far corner of the room. “He can be a bit... inconsiderate at times.” “What's happening?” Amanda said, rubbing her eyes. “Where am I?” “Why, Hell, of course.” “Why, what did I do wrong?” “Oh, nothing, my dear. You wrote in your last letter that you wanted to meet before answering my proposal.” Amanda stood up and her eyes suddenly narrow. “You’re Marc?” “It’s actually pronounced with an s-sound as in Marcellixis. But yeah.” Amanda looked at the silhouette sitting on the throne. His red eyes burned like hot iron in the darkness. “So… everything you wrote about hell and suffering and brimstone, that wasn’t metaphorical?” Marc shrugged. “I do enjoy a bit of hyperbole every now and then, but no, most of it was literal.” “So, what, you're going to try and make me fall in love with you now?” “I’m not going to make you do anything, you came here of your own free will, remember?” “This is preposterous!” Amanda said, pushing her shoulder against the massive doors. “I've been accused of worse.” The demon rose from the throne and sauntered up to her. His long mane of onyx hair swirled behind him like smoke. His pearly skin and chiseled face were not what she had expected. “Let’s just have a date like we agreed on, and see where things lead,” he said. “What if you fall in love with me, and I don't want you back?” “Oh, please.” “What? It's a legitimate question.” He leaned casually against the brimstone wall. A brilliant white smile parted his lips. He winked at her. “I, um...” She looked down at her feet. “It... it doesn't matter. Looks don't matter.” “You already know everything about me.” The demon leaned in, and the breath in her ear sent a shiver rolling down her spine. “The looks are just a bonus.” “I think this is a bad idea…” “What’s the worst that could happen?” She swallowed hard. No way. He was evil incarnate. There was no way. “Let’s go on that date, what do you say?” he continued, running a nail down her shoulder. “You can’t make me fall in love with you if I don’t want to,” Amanda said finally. “Oh, I would never dream of that.” He looked into the distance. “True love is precious. But if we end up just friends, I’m okay with that too. We’re friends, right?” Amanda nodded. “One date.” “That’s all I ask for.” “Okay, then. But not here. On Earth.” “Deal,” the demon said, grinning. “I've made a reservation at La Guinness for eight o'clock. Don't be late.” * Amanda opened her eyes, gasping. The alarm clock on her nightstand showed 03:33. She groaned and rolled over, trying to go back to sleep. It had only been a dream. That's when she noticed the letter on her pillow. In the light from her phone, she tore it open. There was a note inside. *Dear Amanda,* *I enjoyed our first meeting very much, and I'm looking forward to our first date!* *Yours truly,* *Marc* *** Amazon links again for your convenience: [US]( https://www.amazon.com/Dating-Demon-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541050230&sr=8-1) | [UK]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dating-Demon-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049245&sr=8-1) | [CA]( https://www.amazon.ca/Dating-Demon-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049324&sr=1-1) | [DE]( https://www.amazon.de/Dating-Demon-English-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049116&sr=8-2) | [AUS]( https://www.amazon.com.au/Dating-Demon-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049424&sr=1-3) | [IN]( https://www.amazon.in/Dating-Demon-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049517&sr=1-1) | [FR]( https://www.amazon.fr/Dating-Demon-English-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049609&sr=8-8) | [ES]( https://www.amazon.es/Dating-Demon-English-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049680&sr=1-3) | [IT]( https://www.amazon.it/Dating-Demon-English-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049715&sr=1-2) | [NL]( https://www.amazon.nl/Dating-Demon-English-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1541049767&sr=1-1) | [JP]( https://www.amazon.co.jp/Dating-Demon-English-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049795&sr=1-2) | [BR]( https://www.amazon.com.br/Dating-Demon-English-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049834&sr=1-2) | [MX]( https://www.amazon.com.mx/Dating-Demon-English-Lilwa-Dexel-ebook/dp/B07G6RFDBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1541049880&sr=1-4)  *** To anyone who decides to pick it up – thank you so much, I really hope you like it! *** *Special thanks to the mods here at r/WritingPrompts, who tirelessly run this amazing community.

a1b5yu,Edit: thank you for the gold strangers!,"Everyone always asks me what it felt like to lose my arm. Everyone always asks me what it feels like to no longer have it.   One answer I'd always wanted to give but never had the courage to, was that it felt mostly like hopelessness. I had been a pianist, I'd lived and judged my life based on my ability to make people feel with music. I was crippled. I could no longer play my favorite pieces. I could no longer practice new ones. Losing the arm was essentially me losing my life.  It's difficult to describe exactly how it feels to have an itch on an arm that isn't there. Imagine the feeling of sitting in a hairdresser's chair and having that annoying little itch crop up on your nose. Now imagine, that your arms are bound to your sides and there's nothing you can do to eliminate that annoying, burning, itch. It's not a terribly nice feeling.  I learned that you can scratch your missing limb by using a mirror. You stand in front of the mirror and scratch your opposite arm while you look into your reflection. Remarkably, this works to eliminate the itch. I learned something else while doing just this very thing a few weeks ago.  I was standing in front of the mirror, awkwardly scratching my elbow on the corner of my bathroom door, when I saw something in the mirror. A girl with eyes the color of charcoal, teeth yellow as rotten lemons, and blood seeping down her pale, pallid complexion. Before I knew exactly what I was doing, I lashed out with my missing arm. It felt like I did anyway. Something incredible happened, I felt my missing fist smash into the face of the incorporeal entity. I felt her teeth come loose, pain explode in my 'hand' and a ghostly tooth lodge into my fist.  I'm not exactly sure who was more surprised, her, or me.  Lights began to flicker in the room and objects around my sink began to hover menacingly. My electric toothbrush launched towards my head and I was narrowly able to dodge out of the way. It firmly embedded itself in the wall behind me. Using the mirror as a reference, I leaped on the ghastly girl and smashed my non-existent fist into her face until she stopped squirming.  She faded away shortly afterwards. She never bothered me again. I'm not sure exactly where the spirits go after I beat them to a pulp, but I have purpose again. Besides, the pay for someone capable of genuinely dispatching a ghost is fantastic. Honestly, I think people mostly pay for the spectacle of a one armed man fighting an invisible ghost.  Now when people ask me what it feels like to be missing an arm, I reply confidently. Sometimes it feels like I never lost it at all.  ***************************************** /r/SirLemoncakes.

ax72vw,"Damn, I came up with this idea while I was waking my dog this morning, wrote it down, then went to school and forgot all about it, I cant believe this post blew up the way it did, and I am very thankful for everyone who commented and especially for giving gold ","My Grandpa, Pops, always said money couldn’t buy you happiness. Pops said a lot of things, and while some of them proved rather bizarre as he got older, on *that* one I always trusted him and he pretty much always proved to be right.  When I was 11 he sat me down to talk about money. I'd never thought about it, never *needed* to think about it, it was just something we had when we needed. He told me about old vs new money. Old money is money handed down from your family, while new money folks had earned it recently. I asked him which we came from and he laughed.  “We boy, are from something else entirely,” he’d smiled at me. “Our money's not old, it’s *ancient*.”  It was years before I properly understood him. Our family had been rich for longer than most countries had existed; we owned the companies that owned banks and we shifted investment portfolios that dwarfed the GDP of major world countries, but Pops explained that we did it quietly, behind the scenes so to speak. When I at last began to understand, I asked Pops if we were part of a group I had heard about on the internet, the Illuminati. Folk seemed obsessed that there were secret groups running the world and it intrigued me. He laughed, they existed, *of course*, but they were 6 or 7 levels of control beneath where Pops was. I never quite had the courage to ask how many levels were above him...  When he died, I was left alone. My parents had died when I was a baby, he'd raised me by himself and now I was the last of our family. I’d been educated, taught what I needed to know about our business and given links to all of his wealth, influence and power, but the one things he’d taught me above all others, was how *not* to use it.  That left me in a pickle, for what do you do when you have enough money to do whatever you want and no one to share it with? My friends were few and far between, but nice and all getting on with their lives. I'd gone to public Schools and done well enough, but m real education had been in Pops kitchen, sitting in front of the fire while he whittled and told me what I needed to know. I had trillions in the bank, but nothing I needed it for….well, to be honest I owned the banks by and large too.  It turned out that life isn’t much fun without a challenge. Like a computer game with cheats turned on, after a while it becomes stale and boring. For a while I tried to live Pops life, working a small hog farm in rural Minnesota, but that wasn't for me, that was still trying to be someone else, trying to be *him*. For a year or so I lived like Dan Bilzerian, but without the publicity or the weird thing that no one ever talks about. I spent money and tried everything in the world I wanted, but... it wasn't actually all that fun.  I needed to find my own place, my own level. So that’s what I did. Turns out though, that with no experience on your résumé and having only half paid attention in school, you're not qualified for much.  *** At 4:03pm every single day, the Compliance Officers of the National Bank Insurance team stood up en mass, as the phone lines closed for the day, and headed for the kitchen. I was going to be late, as usual, as trainees needed to do double the paperwork and if I didn’t get it done now, then I would be staying late again this evening. I offered a small prayer that someone might save a decent biscuit for me, rather than being stuck with just a plain digestive and hunched over, trying to fire through the forms to get them in as quickly as possible. A looming shadow cut me off mid thought and hovered over me in a mildly sinister way.   “Aaah, Jimbo?” It was Stuart, the team manager and a man who seemed to exude grease. His voice seemed to whine, each note dragged out as if it hated coming from him as much as I hated hearing it. I’d told him a number of times to not call me “Jimbo”, but Jim, yet he ignored me each time.  “Hi Stuart, I’m just getting these finished up before…”  “Uuuuuh, yes, so we need to have a chat, you see, coffee breaks reeeally need to be taken once you’ve completed your core work. We can’t have you just sneaking off for a brew whenever you feel like it!” He laughed at what he must have thought was a joke, an annoying ‘hnyak hnyuk noise’. I held a breath for a second to stay calm. “No problem Stuart, as you can see, I’ve not moved and am completing them right now.” He didn’t listen, or if he did, he didn’t care. “You see Jimbo, if you want to get ahead, you have to learn from me. I started here just eight years ago and worked my way up, you can’t just expect to get given a good job in this world.” “No, that’s fine, if I can just crack on with…” “You see, investments are a bit like seduction.” He perched on the corner of my desk, polyester shirt crinkling and reflecting the light from the strip lighting overhead. I began to wonder if he was still a virgin. “You can’t just thrust forward, you need to take you time, do the *reeeesearch* Jimbo.” That confirmed it, he was both a virgin and seemingly knew fuck all about investing. A small part of me wondered if he could possibly handle the truth about me, but that was the problem really. This game only worked if you committed, if you *lived* the life you were pretending to live. If you simply flashed your cash at the first problem, then it… He ruffled my hair. “You’re just not a *natural* Jimbo, but if you stick with me, maybe you’ll manage to get there.” I smiled, drew a hand through my hair, feeling his sweat that had rubbed off into my hair and tried not to gag. Fuck the game.  I pushed my seat back, knocking his legs so he almost fell off the desk. “Yeah,. thanks *Stewy*, I gotta take a whizz, so you hold tight.” His mouth gaped open as I let the little persona I had donned drop away. No more hunching, no more pretending, no more Jimbo. A faint hnyak echoed behind me, making my skin crawl.  Money can’t buy happiness, Pops was right, but it can buy a *lot* of things, including people who’ll do your exact wish on very short notice. I tossed the trash phone I had been using into the nearest bin and pulled out my real phone; a Ziphec tech. As far as I knew, only four people in the world had access to this phone, money alone couldn't buy it, you only got it if you *needed* it. It was simply able to access... more information that usual. National Bank was trading at £6.21 a share and in three quick messages I owned six percent of it and became the largest stock holder. Rules, laws, corporate accountability, governments, all were obstacles that swept away immediately by money. 6% was plenty, but 14% was what I wanted to give me enough control to call an Extraordinary General Meeting of the board, which I did three minutes later. I took a pee while a dozen board members found themselves called to a virtual meeting. Men in suits walked into offices, buildings and private homes, regardless of where they were and what they were doing, board members joined the meeting remotely. One was in Brazil watching football, one in Thailand... otherwise occupied. All were located within three minutes.  The meeting took less than thirty seconds and the board were dismissed and replaced with my own team, who as I washed my hands, began to order instructions. Two minutes later, as my hands finished drying, a text beeped onto my phone. It was done. It was all done. I went for a coffee, hitting the kitchen just as most of the team were finishing up and feeling only a slight pang to see that all the chocolate biscuits were gone. Still, as I dunked the dry biscuit into my cup of tea, I was happy enough to simply wait for the entertainment to begin.  Perfect timing is easy when money and manpower is no object and as I walked back to my desk, the first pieces were falling into place. Stuart’s mother was at his desk, a not unfamiliar sight, but today she had someone with her. Most people’s lives are all fairly transparent, their past researchable if you know how and who to do it. For Stuart’s mum, the key was an old School flame, who was happy to show up at her door after being offered… a sum of money. “You’re kicking me out?” Stuart screeched. “But I *live* there mummy!” His mother, looking happier than I had ever seen her before. Of course the only times I had seen her was when she was accompanying Stuart as his date to the Xmas party. She kissed the woman who stood beside her and they walked out together. They'd be getting a new house in a new city, his mother had been surprisingly easy to convince, I was told. For a moment Stuart stood in shock, but a beeping from his pocket roused him. He fished his phone out and I noted in interest that it was the model down from the one I had so recently discarded. He stared at the screen as alert after alert sounded, confirming the deletion of his level 124 Ork Master General from BattleWorld, the MMO he mentioned on a near-constant basis. 4 years it had taken him to level up, but he’d find the company helpdesk *surprisingly* unhelpful if he tried to get his account back. Weirdly I felt an actual pang of guilt, but it's not like I was EA.  Finally the kicker, his boss, a woman who had despised him for years and barely hid it, walked across the office with an envelope in hand. She carefully hid her smirk as she handed it to him, touched him on the shoulder and shook her head. “Sorry Stuart, new owners have decided a round of downsizing is in order.” She looked around at the confused faces. “Back to work the rest of you.” As he left the office, belongings carried out in a box, I wondered when he’d realise that he had no home to go to and then, when he’d consider where his pet tortoise was. I slid open my top drawer and dropped in a piece of lettuce – I wasn’t a monster, he’d get his pet back, but if you’re going to ruin a man, you can’t do things by halves. That was another saying Pops always liked, but he always was a *very* smart man. *** /r/fringly or /r/dcfu for various bits of my writing. ",6205
axgwmn,"EDIT: Holy *crap* this blew up. I want to thank everyone for their stories and input, and also would like to shout out the one dude who took their time to give me Reddit silver. Thanks for my first award!","It was like Japanese, except drawn by a man with tremors. Strange, complex characters that looked almost like they intended to paint a picture in and of themselves. ""I think your printer is broken, Miss."" I turned the ticket, tapping at the gibberish. ""This is unreadable."" She shook her head. ""Gate F. Walk through E and show the attendant your ticket."" I narrowed my eyes. ""Okay, but... Whatever. What does it cost?"" ""Nothing monetary."" ""Sorry, what?"" ""It costs no money."" ""Okay, but..."" There was an oddity to the situation, yes, but what started as a dare quickly became curiousity. I mean, it was an airport, so it's not like they could kidnap me or something, right? ""Sure. Thank you."" Back with the group, I showed them my ticket. They took turns gawking at it, flipping it different ways. ""What the fuck, man?"" Harold asked, passing it to James. ""This is a joke, right?"" ""If it is, the cashier is a really good actor. I mean, this is crazy, right? Like, what the hell is this weird ticket? This feels like a Twilight Zone episode."" I took the ticket back. ""You better get going if you have any hope of boarding,"" James said, nodding. ""It apparently leaves in twenty minutes."" ""Yeah, which is even weirder. It should already be boarding by now, so..."" ""Send snaps. Maybe it'll be some private jet filled with Playboy bunnies,"" Harold said, ribbing James. ""Only one way to find out."" I grabbed my bag, waving goodbye and sprinting toward security.  They took a look at my ticket, then rushed me through TSA pre and escorted me through Gate E. The guards all shifted uncomfortably as I passed them, and the attendant at the supposed Gate F entrance looked no more comfortable. ""Go ahead, sir,"" the stocky man said, moving to let me pass. He shot a sideways glance at me without bothering to check my ID. I walked through the hallway, which was lit well but had no windows. At the end, there was a door. I hesitated to open it, one hand on the cold doorknob. *I mean, fuck it, right? What's the worst that could happen?* Through the door, I stepped into what was, at best guess, a large warehouse. Sort of like a giant garage, filled with all kinds of technology I hadn't seen before, save for one single thing. A Tesla Roadster. A security officer opened the driver door and motioned me in. ""Your ride awaits you."" I eyed him, throwing my bag into the passenger seat before settling in. It was comfortable and sleek, modern in all senses. The doors locked without my input, and no amount of pulling at the handles opened them. Suddenly, I was turned upward, my weight shifting back, with a loud whirring sound swirling all around. ""What the *fuck*? Hello? HELP ME!"" Pounding on the dashboard and windows was fruitless. The only response I received was that of a digital announcer, crackling through an intercom.  *""Good luck on your voyage, Starman.""* ------- */r/resonatingfury*",5169
b8i1tm,"[Update] Oh my gosh! You guys have smashed this out of the park. Had this idea a few weeks ago and while it wasnt really my genre, I figured someone here might make something good! If anyone decides to pursue this, Id love to beta read for you! + Thanks for the gold and silver! On my first post too :) Looking forward to sharing more ideas in the future!","“I’m sorry, I don’t know ASL,” the woman behind the cashier’s desk said.  Mentally sighing, I reached out and tapped the paper I put out in front of her. “I can’t speak. I want to know where your frozen dinners are, you moved them. Can you please tell me what aisle you’ll find them in?” The woman in front of the counter was older, probably in her seventies, and adjusted her glasses and peered down at it. As she had the last three times, she read the first three words and looked up at with wide, sorrowful eyes. Pitying eyes. “I think we can get you an ASL translator?” Oh my God, I thought. This wasn’t a new thing for me, but it was rarely so repeated. I swear to all I hold holy, you’re so dense you need to be taken to Cern as a possible canidate for Dark Matter.  The woman behind me snorted in laughter, and I felt my cheeks flush. Enjoy the show, lady. I shoved my hands into my pockets to hide their trembling. “No, I didn’t mean that, I just...good lord, hold on a second. How do you not know he’s asking where the frozen dinners are?” she said.  Both the cashier and I turned to stare at her. “They’re in Isle 17,” the cashier said weakly. But I was the one with the wider eyes. How the hell did you read the paper from there? The woman behind me’s eyes widened when I had the thought. Woman might be a stretch. She looked a year or two older than me, just old enough to be in college. “What?” she asked. Oh my God, it’s like you can read my mind. I thought. The woman went pale all of a sudden, like she just had seen a ghost. “Uh...why don’t I help you with those dinners?” she said weakly.  Oh yes, because being unable to speak directly effects my ability to move my arms. I shrugged and took a step out of the line that had piled up behind me. The woman followed. “You can’t tell anyone,” she hissed quietly. Because I clearly can tell so many people so many things, I thought with a scowl. The woman laughed, and I stopped cold. She froze as well. We both looked at each other for a long moment.  You really can read my mind, I thought. I swear, if the woman’s eyes grew eye wider, they’d be in danger of falling out of her skull.  “I thought you already knew,” she thought. You can read my mind really badly, I added, running a hand through my too long hair, hair that needed a trim I couldn’t afford.  “Oh God oh shit, I’m so screwed, I let you know…” the woman was practically vibrating with fear. I was shaking too, but for a different reason. Fear was part of it, yes. Telepathy was supposed to be impossible. But this woman...this woman was casually reading my mind, even if she was terrible at picking up subtext.  “Listen, I know what you thought, but if you tell anyone I told you I’ll be cast out. I’ll be exiled. And then I...I just don’t know what happens. Without the protection I get I-”  In a swift notion, I reached up to the neck of my turtleneck and pulled it down. She cut herself off, the way most people did when she saw the ugly scar across my throat. It was so wide, it looked almost like a second mouth. Ironic, given that it had left me silent since I was twelve. “What happened?” she asked. Car accident, I lied. Through my head flashed an image of a beer bottle, broken, a man screaming in a drunken rage.  “No, that wasn’t a car accident,” she said, her hands balling into fists at her side. “You...how old are you?” Seventeen I thought. Look, I’m sorry, I don’t even know  you’re name and you’re reading my mind and- “Clara,” she said, holding out her hand. “Clara Hamilton. And you are Greg. You have a last name but you hate it so I’m not going to repeat it out loud out of respect.” Thanks, I thought. It was so good to have a normal conversation with someone. It’d only been a year. I still barely spoke ASL myself. Enough to get by if I couldn’t find paper, but paper was easier, and more people could- “Read that then understand ASL. You’re right about that. Look...are you still living with the person that did this to you?” The way my mind carefully went blank gave it all away. Clara’s eyes hardened. “Yeah. Okay, look. How would you like an alternative.” Now I could only blink in confusion. What are you saying?  “I live with others like me. I’m so dead for telling you any of this by the way, but...well, what I can do isn’t something you’re born with. It can be learned. And given...given everything, I’m sure I can convince them to take you in. It’s not right.” I felt my heartrate speed up. My step father will  never let me go. Clara gave me a smile that was far too nice to actually be kind. Like the warmth from a flame before it leapt onto the walls. “I’m not the best telepath. I’m very good at being very, very persuasive. I promise you, Greg, your stepfather will not be an obstacle.” And I’ll learn to be a telepath? I thought. “I can’t promise what you’ll learn. But I can promise you...you’ll be surrounded by people that can understand you. I’ll understand if you want time to -” Can we do this now? I have my car in the parking lot. Clara smiled and laughed. “Then...let’s go.” Practically floating, I followed her, the groceries abandoned. That was three years before the discovery of our hidden community. That was three years before the Night of Burning Skies and the War. That was three years before I did learn telepathy. That was three years before the rest of humanity tried to take away the first happiness I’d known in my life. So if you want to know why I’m here, why I walked into your base of operations, and why your men are all going to sleep one by one, Director....it was because a woman was kind to me. These people you call monsters were kind to me. They gave me a home, when the rest of humanity had given me nothing but scorn.  Now pick up that shard of glass on your desk. Good. Because you personally have killed six people I care about. Personally.  Ah, good, you can see what I’m making you do with it. Don’t worry, Director, you’ll still be alive when your people find you.  Of course, they’ll execute you. You’ve been touched by one of our minds, and you won’t ever be able to convince them I didn’t brainwash you. After all, how will you when you won’t even be able to speak? --- More short works by me at /r/hydrael_writes More long works by myself and others at /r/redditserials ",3762
bgxcjk,Edit: Wow this blew up better than I thought it would.,"You'd think there'd be better uses for that kind of precognition, but apparently the Psychic Currents of the Universe or whatever only reveal themselves in certain oblique ways. Also, you know, bureaucrats. I don't know which of them first had the bright idea to handle Guaranteed Minimum Income this way, or decided it was a good idea to give that kind of lump sum to 21-year-olds, but apparently one of them got enough time with a government psychic to test it out. As you can imagine, it's caused some problems. There are all kinds of ways laid out online to calculate remaining lifespan by the payment sum, but of course they're all just guesses. The amount's all the psychics can give us, not years, not health, nothing. Just so many dollars and a pat on the butt. God, or whatever weird persnickety divine official runs the whole mess, only knows. The other things the psychics—the real ones, I mean, not the kind who incessantly advertise on TV—can tell us are just as randomly semi-useful. I won't get into that, but I will say it's jacked the anxiety of an entire society into even more stratospheric heights than things like social media already had. And it's not like they're accurate 100% of the time, at least not on longish timelines. Sometimes things shift, because the Powers that Be really do seem to be playing dice in some back room, and the psychics know the odds but not the outcome, you know? At least that's my understanding, and no one has a very good understanding anyway, least of all the psychics themselves, they just think on things and get stuff like numbers back. But that probably doesn't matter anymore. I mean it will, until just after lunch. Because that's what the amount was for, my favorite cheap lunch from my favorite taco stand. One carne asada, one adobo pork, a nice little churro for dessert. $7.27, every time, I have a box at home full of the receipts. So of course I bought it again, just one last time. A lot of people turn 21 on a given day, and one Hell of a lot of them post their checks on social media. It didn't take long for us all to compare notes and figure it out. Some people got more, a few less, but almost all of them recognized the amount. Lunch. Just one. Guess fate took a pretty hard right turn today. This many people, all at once, with a consistent and personalized number? That's a pretty sure thing, an undeniable shift in the odds to from long-shot to almost-certain. Who knows what it's going to be. Asteroid with a low albedo we just didn't see coming? Maybe the Yellowstone Caldera going off? Nuclear war? Alien invasion? Not worth worrying about. I mean, that won't stop any of us, won't stop the whole world. A lot of people are still hoping it's a prank. I don't think so. I have a feeling, a little itch at the back of my brain. I'm gonna have to *really* enjoy these tacos. &#x200B; r/Magleby for more elaborate lies.",3939

Sorry!","My profile page bore the golden border that indicated a number one position. A first place spot in a ranking. I was astonished. As far as I knew, there was nothing remarkable about my life.  I clicked open my rankings dashboard. At the very top of the page, my highest accolade read: “#1 Most Time Spent Awake, But Still in Bed — Darell Harrelson”.  I gaped at the screen. The rest of the Internet cafe had paused to watch my revelation. I could feel their eyes probing.  I blushed heavily and left my coffee unfinished by the computer.

cdl9p3,"Wow, was not expecting this, thanks for the silver:) and the gold:))","My first thought is that I'm insane. My second is that I'm way too stoned, my eyes glancing at the half-smoked joint sitting in the ashtray on the porch. I'm dead sure I just heard Jax speak. And now there are howls in the distance, a chorus of neighborhood dogs calling to one another, Jax included. ""Can you repeat that?"" I say, forming the words slowly. Jax abruptly halts his call to the skies, one paw still resting on the chewed up orange ball. ""You need to get inside."" I try to comprehend the situation, my muscles involuntarily locking, with only my eyes flitting back and forth between Jax, the lawn, the half smoked joint and the orange ball. Something wet hits my bare foot, causing me to snap out of my paralysis. I swipe at the long line of drool hanging from the corner of my mouth. ""Get inside,"" Jax says again in some sort of bastard approximation of his bark. I turn and walk back to the house, still not quite understanding but now starting to accept - despite the absurd improbability of the situation - that my golden retriever is talking to me. ""Hurry, Abe,"" Jax says, nuzzling his snout against my ass. ""There isn't much time."" I sit down on the living room couch, scratching my head in a caricature of confusion. ""What in the world..."" I say, mouthing the words silently as I stare out the window at Jax, who is now rapidly digging a hole in the front lawn with a dedication quite unbecoming of the lazy, irreverent best friend I thought I knew. Another line of drool drapes itself across my knee and slowly steeps to the floor, forgotten. Jax pulls out what looks like a flak vest and a riot helmet and somehow dons them, then begins to howl again. The howl has a deep sense of purpose behind it, almost like a battle cry, like some sort of canine call to action. My dog flashes a look back in my direction. His eyes contain a deep intelligence that wasn't there before. Noticing my discomfort and confusion, Jax bounds up to the window. ""We are man's best friend,"" he growls through the glass, puffing up his chest with pride.  ""To defend you is our true purpose.""  A woman is sprinting down the street, causing Jax to snap back around and crouch low. She screams a terrible, blood curdling yell as something black streaks across the pavement and cannons into her, causing her to flail into the concrete. The creature rips the back of the woman's head to shreds before she even comes to a stop. I'm pretty sure it is Samantha, the kind lady down the street. The black creature stops, satisfied with Samantha's splayed, lifeless form, then it turns and looks me dead in the eye, it's fangs glistening with bright red blood. ""Fucking cats,"" Jax says, setting his shoulders.",7722
cypeyl,"Hello WritingPrompts! Like the title says, about ten months ago, I found myself responding to this prompt one night: > [**[WP] You have long been fascinated by swords, and have mastered every kind of sword fighting technique known to man. No man can defeat you. But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9sjttr/wp_you_have_long_been_fascinated_by_swords_and/) Then, after serializing it on my subreddit and turning it into a story larger than I ever thought possible, I arrived at the decision about whether to make it a book. For a lot of writers, publishing a book is *the dream*, and in all honesty, I didn’t think I would ever actually do it. But now, after a lot of procrastination, a lot of late nights, a lot of learning, and a ton of editing, it’s here. The entire series, named By The Sword, is a high fantasy trilogy of books with paranormal/supernatural elements, of which I’m publishing the first right now which comes in just shy of 100k words long. The book’s cover art was done by the fantastic /u/IsmaelGil, and I’m extremely happy with [how it turned out!](https://i.imgur.com/JIY228X.jpg) As the title of this post says, that book is entitled Blood and Steel. You can read its synopsis right here: > Death is a fickle thing. > For most, it’s a force of nature, but Agil Novan sees the reaper in a different light. As the greatest swordsman of all time, he cherishes life, and he’s lived one full of both struggle and success. After all of his accomplishments, he too must face the reaper and its scythe. > When challenged, however, the swordsman is not one to go without a fight. After parrying it once and impressing the reaper with a show of the blade, he is offered something more. A second chance at life—one that he is all but forced to accept. > Now, stranded in an unfamiliar land with an unfamiliar body and far too many questions, Agil has his life threatened at every turn. Still, he is determined to survive. He knows what the reaper did to him.  > And he has never been one to let vengeance go unfulfilled. **You can check out the Amazon page for Blood and Steel [here, where you can buy it as an ebook!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X6S9FRT)** The ebook is priced at $2.99 and the paperback is priced at $9.99. The book is also available in a myriad of other marketplaces: ***Kindle Ebook*** [**US**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**UK**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**DE**](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**FR**](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**ES**](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**IT**](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**NL**](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**JP**](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**BR**](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**CA**](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**MX**](https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**AU**](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07X6S9FRT)  ***Physical Paperback*** *Note: With Kindle’s Matchbook program, you can get a free ebook copy with any paperback purchase!* [**US**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1089217587) | [**UK**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1089217587) | [**DE**](https://www.amazon.de/dp/1089217587) | [**FR**](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/1089217587) | [**ES**](https://www.amazon.es/dp/1089217587) | [**IT**](https://www.amazon.it/dp/1089217587) | [**JP**](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/1089217587) --- If you do end up reading the book, please consider leaving a review as well!

Now, without any further ado, I’ll leave you with the first chapter of Blood and Steel! --- --- Live by the sword, die by the sword. That was the way I lived for so long. It was an old adage—ancient even, depending on the version being told, but it was a useful one for someone like me.  I was first told it by my father during the final years of his life. It came only a few short months after I started training, in fact. A few short months of becoming fascinated by the art of sword-fighting and spending every waking minute trying to master it. My father was proud of me for my effort. He always gave me the largest smile when I explained this stance or that, detailing my dreams of becoming the greatest swordsman of them all. Of becoming a Knight of Credon and protecting our kingdom more effectively than any before me. He entertained my teenage ramblings without complaint. And since he’d been a swordsman himself during his formative years, he made sure to pass off that ancient wisdom before it became too late. It was the last gift he ever gave me. If only I’d known how true it was. That mantra repeated in my head now as I stared across my path. Standing out there in my field, only a few dozen paces away from me, the reaper stared right back. Wind billowed through its tattered black cloak. It made no effort to conceal the bleached bone underneath. All it did was balance its scythe in skeletal fingers as though taunting me to come and fight. I wondered why it didn’t simply attack me for my ignorance, why it didn’t finish the job after I had ignored all of the signs. A tense pain in my chest and a sudden shortness of breath were the only warnings I’d gotten during my morning walk. But before the reaper had appeared, I’d shrugged them both off. I’d been stupid and short-sighted enough to allow my time to come. Yet the reaper just stood there, watching me. With my sword held at the ready, I considered if it was scared. Whether or not it was doubting the frozen moment in time when its scythe would harvest my soul. Perhaps it hadn’t expected me to resist, I ventured. After all, landing a strike on a swordsman of my caliber wasn’t easy for anyone. The rational part of me didn’t think that was it, though. It didn’t fit with the concept of the end-bringer at all. The beast of decay was part of nature as we were told; it was integral to the cycle of the world. And while I’d never entirely agreed with that interpretation, especially not after my father had been ripped away from his life, it still shouldn’t have had any issue with a measly swordsman. Then again, the word measly hadn’t described me for decades. I stepped forward, my foot crunching on the path I walked almost every morning. *My* path, I reminded myself. The tranquil sanctuary that I’d cultivated for years. I was supposed to be safe when I walked it, and I had been until *it* had shown up. A sneer formed on my face as I continued to approach. Its tattered cloak still drifted on the wind. Its scythe still balanced in silence. But as I neared, it looked up. It stared at me, nearly striking fear into my heart. The reaper stopped and raised its scythe. It angled the ever-sharpened metal in my direction. For a moment, I could’ve sworn I saw a smile on its face. But I wasn’t sure, as it was already charging my way. My body surged into action. The reaper disappeared from its spot and struck through the air like lightning to force me down with its scythe. Yet as the frozen moment passed with the shriek of clashing metal, I was left standing. The resistance was still fresh in my bones. I’d parried it, I realized, on instinct and fear alone. As I glared back at its still form once more, picking apart details of the bone, I saw the surprise. I knew what it meant. The beast had never been parried before. A grin grew across my lips as I readied my blade again. Its surprise would keep the scythe at bay for the moment, but I still had to be ready. I would never let my guard down. As I’d expected, the surprise faded in short time and it was on me again. I watched it charge with inhuman speed, almost gliding over the ground. I only dodged with a stumble as its scythe cut right through where I’d been. That attack had been faster than before, I noted. It had hit closer. I had to be ready. I furrowed my brows and felt ice-cold fire flood my veins. It signaled the onset of battle, and I took the change in stride. Feeling the burn of sunlight on my skin, I stared back at the beast with everything I had and only barely ducked its next attempt at my life. The blade came through right where my head had been. The scythe, however, never reached my former location. Instead, it turned at the last second. But even with the turn of steel, I was ready. It was one of the oldest tricks in the book.  I parried the hit without a second thought.  Surprise returned to its hooded, bleach-white face. The beast stared down at its unstained scythe, and I had to stifle a chuckle. It didn’t matter how fast it was. I would never let my guard down.  I leapt backward, my feet already positioning themselves for the next attack. The beast growled, its tone dark enough to strike terror in any ordinary mind. But I was no ordinary mind—even at my age, I was as sharp.  I narrowed my eyes, brought my sword out to the defense, and ignored the call to blunder. Its skeletal form charged me again—just as I’d predicted. My lips curled slightly as I turned in the nick of time and whipped the hilt of my blade around my wrist. The clang that rang out was one to split mountains. Both of our weapons fell, but I was more than ready for it. I swept mine up in an instant and was already twisting away. A smile blossomed across my lips. I would never let my guard down.  Then, spinning back with my blade in hand, I shoved steel deep into the hooded cloak. My ears twitched at the screech of metal tearing through bone. As soon as I heard it, I retracted my arm. My feet pushed me backward, and I swung my blade out to guard. Looking over the serene path turned battlefield, I saw too many familiar things. The ornate stone lining in the dirt. The shaded patch of trees. My humble homestead barely visible over the hills. It had no right to be here, I told myself. It had no right to take me here. This was my *home,* world’s dammit. And I would never let my guard down. Images flashed through my mind—parries, deflects, attacks. I was ready. The power in my muscles was already responding to clean commands. But as it turned out, none of it was needed. The beast stood, paralyzed.  Carrying the same surprise it had shown seconds before, the reaper stared at the grass. Its ash-black robe wavered in the breeze and its skeletal form hunched as though responding to a weight. Watching it, I relaxed my shoulders a hair. The situation was painted clear as day on its face. It had never been hit before either. Ragged black cloth lifted back off its head to expose pale white bone to the sunlight above. Its dark eyes were riddled with confusion when it turned to me. It stared, and I almost looked, almost sealed my glorious fate. But at the last moment, I recognized the trick.  Darkness crawled out of its eyes. I snapped mine shut before it could take me, my father’s proud face flashing in my mind. Another one of his warnings played back through my head. *Never look into the face of death.* The embodiment of decay rushed at me anew—I felt it in the air. Heard it. *Smelled* it. Its speed was even greater than before and I only barely shook off the strike. Even with my eyes closed, with my most important sense stripped away, I would never let my guard down. I snapped my eyes open while sprinting away, readied for the attacks that were sure to hit my unarmed side. I waited, my ears perked and my eyes sharp. The strikes never came.  After a dozen strides, I turned back to the beast, expecting to see the same dry surprise as before. I didn’t. Instead, I saw the beast’s cracked, white skull with the hood completely off. Bitterness fell on my tongue. It coated my mouth with disgust. I felt power radiating from in front of me; I felt it washing off the bone. Simply looking into its face forced my blood to run cold. Where I’d expected to see the same complete and utter shock, I saw confirmation of what I hadn’t wanted to be true. An expression more terrifying than any other. A smile. The crooked, skeletal grin was perfect and horrid at the same time. It spawned a sense of worry deep within me that I rejected as unnatural. I was a warrior, a swordsman, a *knight*—I didn’t have time for worry. And yet, as I felt my gaze stay frozen, the dread only deepened.  The beast didn’t rush at me. It didn’t move to attack. It didn’t even reach for its scythe. For some reason, it seemed done with the fight. “Impressive display,” it said, words reaching my ears on the wind. Its voice came like the concept of decay itself, forcing me to shudder as it ate at my mind. I hadn’t seen its bony mouth move an inch. “Thank you,” I replied through gritted teeth, unconsciously getting myself into stance. The beast noticed and raised a dismissive hand. “There is no need for that. I have no intention of keeping this up.” “Then what do we do now?” I asked, keeping my gaze as harsh as nails. My fingers curled around my blade’s loyal grip. I knew it was playing with me—I knew the reaper’s words were a trick, but I would never let my guard down. The beast chuckled dryly. ”You are unique.” I glared at the thing, barely avoiding its eyes. It was toying with me and I knew it. Why couldn’t I take advantage? Why couldn’t I just strike now? No, I thought, dismissing the questions. It was smarter than that. It knew I wouldn’t let my guard down, and it wouldn’t let its guard down either.  “And?” was the only word I mustered in response. “It would be a shame to let someone like you fall to the house of the dead.” My gaze lifted, brows furrowing on my face. “What are you getting at?” “I could give you another chance,” it said, the tone of its voice spawning hatred deep in my chest. The beast’s smile all but dropped as the force in its words made one thing abundantly clear. It was serious.  My mind raced, remembering my younger form longing for more time by the sword. Would it really give me another chance?  “Yes,” it said, the dark words dragging hope out of my soul. “What’s the catch?” I asked. Its grin returned, more devilish than before. A chill ran down my spine. “You will have a different body. But you will retain your mind. Life would be more a curse if I were to take that from you.” I considered the offer against my better judgment. The same instincts that were guiding my stance screamed at me to stop. But as I stared at the beast, sunlight dancing on cracked bone, I could find no fault in its intentions. “What do I have to do?” Its grin grew wider. “One touch—and a new life is yours.” Overcome by a dark, sudden, inexorable urge, I agreed. As though manipulated by some outside force, the desperation in my mind preyed on my memories and won out over all doubt. The reaper appeared next to me like a shot of ashen lightning. Its finger approached my shoulder, cooling the air around it as it went. My grip tightened and my mind screamed, but it was already too late. The bleach-white bone touched my skin and my body filled with ice.  My mind burned. My bones froze. And I experienced the most agonizing second of the rest of my life before everything went black. --- A jolt of motion startled me up from my slumber. I twisted, feeling only the most distant of pain. Everything was numb. A cold, unfamiliar haze was draped over my mind. I stared into the black, faintly wishing for the ability to feel again. Unfortunately, my wish was granted in short time. My body snapped up. A frigid wind crashed against my face, sending shivers down my spine and a howl through my ears. In a second, everything came back and my mind spun through the images. New mixed with old and familiar with foreign as my mind swirled, but I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I clenched my jaw and waited for it to stop. And yet, as soon as it did, one thought was left, one that forced my lips into a smile.  The beast hadn’t lied.  When I opened my eyes, I hoped to see my land. I hoped to see my fields, the rows of crops that I was no longer even required to tend. I hoped to see my wife, the beautiful face that just barely escaped me. But the eyes that only vaguely felt like my own were met with a completely different sight.  All around me, spinning in the wind as if just to mock me for my choices, was a dark forest that I couldn’t recognize. Feeling the horrid cold cut deeper, my smile faded. I forced myself up, noting soreness in my bones. My muscles were hollow. My arms were shorter. My legs were… different. Everything about me felt *frail*, as if on the verge of collapse. And as I sat up on whatever rock my body had been strewn across, I felt sharp pain cut a deep pit through my stomach. My brain started to spin again, the foreign thoughts, worries, and memories all coming back at once. As the waves passed, they were replaced with regret that was only my own. I shivered, the truth cementing in my mind. This wasn’t what I’d wanted. It wasn’t what I’d wanted at all. I closed my eyes—if they even were my eyes—and shook my head, trying to force it all away. My efforts were useless as the world set in and one horrible thought echoed out in my head. *I’d let my guard down.* --- [Original Response](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9sjttr/wp_you_have_long_been_fascinated_by_swords_and/e8pg0oa/) | [My Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palmerranian)",YES!!!!

d4rqp3,Please don’t attack me for my grammar: I wrote this on my phone in the car going to MacDonalds in a few minutes. Thank you for understanding.,"The man by the button immediately pulled out a pistol. “Let me cut to the chase,” he said, “My name is Steven Burke, you can call me Seven. I’ve worked as a top assassin for over 7 years and quite frankly I’m sick of it. So, through extraordinary circumstances I’ve managed to get all six of you together in this one space.” Seven proceeded to point at the man next to me, “ Now, you’re all going to tell me what your lives consist of, starting with #6.” The man looked confused, “Uh, I’m Bruce Johnson, I work as an accountant for a restaurant chain.” “Ugh, crunching numbers sounds lame!” said Seven who then shot #6 in the face. Everyone in the elevator started to panic. “Next!” Seven exclaimed. One of the men shouted out, “I’m Daniel Kerns, I’m a skydiving instructor!” “I’m afraid of heights. Next!” said Seven as he shot the next man. “I’m Xavier Reeves, I work as an ice cream taste tester” said #5. “Sounds promising, but I’m lactose intolerant. Next!” shouted Seven as he shot #5. “My patience is wearing thin. You three, just tell me your names and professions at once!” The men before me both proceeded to declare they are a neurosurgeon and a freelance artist. Neither sounded appealing to Seven as he murdered them both. “Now, you,” Seven told me, “tell me your name and profession.” “Uh, I’m Noah Matiezyn, I work in fast food.” I pathetically let out. “Hmmm, fast food. That sounds like work I can get accustomed to. Give me your ID now.” I immediately handed it over, although it was definitely a struggle due to all the dead bodies present. “Now, it’s time for you to die.” Seven said as he pointed at me. “No!” I shouted as I grabbed on to his gun. A couple of gunshots echoed until there was only silence.. A couple hours later, maintenance workers and several FBI agents were able to pry open the door. They were astounded by the bloody room. “Are you alright sir?” one agent asked, “We’ve been pursuing the deadly assassin Seven for a long time. Glad you were able to end his reign of terror. What is your name?” Thinking about it, I responded with “Xavier Reeves.”",2147
elbe2s,"Wow, I did *not* expect such a huge turnout for my first ever prompt. The prompt itself arose from a friend and I doing some random banter back and forth, and I just posted up part of that banter as the prompt, essentially.

Oh, sure, there could be life somewhere far out there. But we never really ventured out into the stars, and it seems unlikely that any other civilization will either.

eumrum,edit: [someone called me out so here's the original](https://twitter.com/TheAndrewNadeau/status/1221583159759904769?s=19),"Her boss let out a groan. He didn’t bother to move the phone away from his mouth, and the sound rippled through the line straight into her sensitive ears. “Are you really? No one around to drive you?”  Helen pinched the bridge of her nose. It was a little bit fattier than it had been the day before. “Yes, really. Do I often lie?”  A stiff exhale came in response. Rick didn’t seem to be in a very charitable mood that day, and she was pretty sure she was going to take a lot of his lashes. “Rick, I simply can’t come in. I need the money — you know that, but I would have to adjust my chair so much, I can’t drive, and I already have a headache trying to figure out the logistics with this peanut I have right now” *Another* annoyed sound drifted through the line, a long sigh this time. “I can’t make up for you today, Helen. You’ll have to make this up somehow, we are coming up to that deadline, and I need all hands on deck.”  “Rick, come on. It’s not as if I planned it, I would kill to stay, say, at least legal age for a while? I can’t even have a drink,” she said. Her arm waving around next to the phone as if he could see her, and she pulled her legs underneath her. At least getting comfortable would be easier that day.  Seven was before her hip began aching. It was before the accident, before the surgery, before age got the best of her. She may not be able to do much, but at least she could be comfortable.  “Call if there's anything I can do from here.” The next noise that came through the phone was a click — he had hung up.  He had been especially vocal at that time. It wasn’t the first time she had woken up young, and it wouldn’t be the last. Although she was thankful that the jumps didn’t start until age 5, it was still hazardous.  Her best friend had stayed between 5 and 15 for almost the whole ten years, but it was uncommon.  Helen had jumped to 19 for a while and found time to take a few courses and get a job. It was nice to be independent… most days.  Pulling her phone away from her head, she opened the text to Laura. The great thing about her young ages clumping together so well was that she was almost always old enough to come to take care of her on days like today. With a hopeful smirk on her face, she sent off a message.  **Seven, today L.** ***Seven.***  - Helen **Shit. Boss happy?**  - Laura  **Boss pissed off. I think he’s like 90 today or something.**  -Helen  **Do you have a free day?**  -Helen **Think you could come keep a small gal company?**  -Helen  **:P sure. Be there with lunch.**    -Laura  Helen didn’t know what she would do without her friends. Her family was far away. She had two parents that, to be honest, weren’t sure why they had even chosen to have kids. The moment she had been around long enough to sign a lease they dump her and left. 18 years alive on the planet, despite the fact that the day after they left she had reverted to 12 and spent the day a sobbing mess.  The next day she had jumped and spent the day unable to move becuase her back hurt so bad. There was no way to know if you needed to sleep on the bed, or couch, or floor. You just couldn’t account for anything; although experiments were being conducted that may help keep track of it all.  Of course, there were also people that believed we got signs. Signs from God, from the stars, from our bodies each night. All these teeny tiny things that would help us prepare for what was to come if only we could tap into it.  Her sister and brother had their own places but in some tiny rural town. The fewer expenses they had day to day, the less they had to worry about things like, say, jobs.  Helen wasn’t interested in that. She wouldn’t let a thing like short legs and a small brain for a day stop her from succeeding. She would get somewhere, dammit.  Her boss, angry and loud today, would forgive her. He always did, becuase she always made up for it.  Well… most of the time. She could have had laura drive her in, and her friend may have even helped her get some of her work done before that big deadline. They had exchanged enough favors, but she didn’t really want to. A chuckle left her mouth at the thought of her in her office chair, finger jabbing at away at the keyboard.  It was comical.   Moments later the doorbell interrupted her thoughts. It wasn’t lunchtime yet, but she was thankful to have company so she didn’t accidentally burn the house down. /r/beezus_writes",2194
fkvh54,"Boy, I never thought this would take off the way it has. This writing prompt was brought to you by my buddy Jed, who does not post to Reddit. I thought it was a great prompt, and wanted to share it.","We've been living in hell for the past five years, and no one has noticed yet. No one but me. How do you notice the world changing, little by little? Piece by piece? How do you notice an avalanche when you're only one snowflake among many, holding your breath, waiting for it all to fall out under you? Today it did. The mountain is rumbling under us, and we're all going to go sliding and crashing down. It will only take a good clap. A single shout. I am in a food line. Everything is lines now. Rations went into effect five years ago, when our president became dictator. He didn't call himself that, of course, but it was the Caesarean way. Claim the ultimate power in a time of crisis and then, when that crisis ends, never relinquish it. Some people call him the Anti-Christ himself. I never used to put any faith in that, but I've grown tired and dizzy and hungry enough that on some level, I'm starting to believe it's true.  Bread lines, gas lines, income lines, lines lines lines. This isn't the first time the thought sprang into my head. *This is hell*. My daughter Missy squeezes my hand. She has learned incredible patience, patience I wouldn't have had when I was a boy. Before the skies went red and the ground dried up and stopped giving us the life we needed to continue on. Only eight years old, and she already has the world-weary eyes of an adult. ""How much longer, do you think, Papa?"" she murmurs. The gas mask she wears is getting small for her. I'll have to scare one up, somehow. Bargain or steal or argue my way into it.  I would do anything for her. After all, it's just the two of us now. She's a good girl. She's waited nearly five hours to ask me that. We rose with the dawn still black and dressed in the dark. We went out here and watched the pale copper disc of the sun rise behind the clouds. ""I don't know,"" I admit. My own mask is so damn itchy and hot. I resist the urge to loosen it and readjust. Can't risk letting the toxic air in. ""No one ever knows,"" Missy says with a tired sigh. She holds her doll cradled in her elbow. It's a potato sack stuffed with old cotton, the eyes mismatched buttons. It was one of the first things I learned to sew, just for her, when she was three years old and all the stores started closing and the bombs first started falling and the panic set in and everything went straight to hell. I will never be as good at it as her mom was. She left so many gaps I cannot fill. The line shuffles forward. One weary person at a time. We all look like ants here, our faces shielded and pronged with filters from the gas masks. The air is unbreathable.  The sky overhead hums and burns.  There's that avalanche feeling again. I can feel the whole hundreds of us hold our breath at once as we tilt our heads up, trying to decide if we should flee or stay. There is always that balance: will this be another drone strike, or can we stay and hold our place in the queue.  My daughter huddles closer to me. She still thinks I could save her, if the worst came to it. She watches the sky, fearfully. She has learned to dread what waits behind the clouds. ""God has sent His angels again,"" someone whispers near us. ""No,"" I snap, squeezing my daughter's hand tighter. ""There's no need to say that."" But the humming grows louder and louder still. Every passing minute makes my shoulders wind with tension. With the instinctive need to flee and hide. The red clouds overhead obscure everything. I don't see the bomb until it falls glittering. It's a distant falling star on the horizon. No one else seems to notice. Their stares are on their feet, on the skies overhead.  All it takes is a clap. A boom. And the avalanche will shake and tumble and we'll all go down down down. That was God's plan all along, wasn't it? I yank my daughter out of the line. ""Missy,"" I say, ""we're going to run."" ""Why?"" Her voice pitches up in panic. ""*Now!*"" I roar at her. We're the first to break the line. The first to run across the dusty cracked asphalt. If we can be the first ones to make it underground, we might just survive.  The explosion glitters on the horizon. Just a cloud. Not a mushroom, thank God, if he's even around to hear. But the sound hits us a second later. The avalanche shudders and roars down. All that panic setting in. Behind us, the line starts breaking apart. Screams rise up. We haven't been attacked in months, and we had grown complacent. Hopeful the long war might finally be over. But I know as surely as I know Missy's hand in mine that it's only just begun. The angels have come in their huge automatons. They come piloting giant robots, huge as planes. I can already see the dark shapes of the robots' wings, their flaming swords burning like starfire through the clouds.  They've come to burn us all. *** If you want to read more, [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofstatic/comments/fkyxm7/hell_rising_part_2/) and [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofstatic/comments/fl1e8f/hell_rising_part_3/) are up now on /r/nickofstatic  Thanks as always for reading! <3",1821
fopfq5,Edit: thank you kind stranger for my first ever reddit award <3,"God passed judgment like He always did. And for the first time in a year, the weight of God’s angry hand lifted from Carl’s tired shoulders. He used to be a priest. You wouldn’t know it from the clothes they sent him out in: ill-fitting and huge, like a boy who'd raided his father’s wardrobe.  People used to confess to him and he judged them in his own way. Now he'd been judged. Now he stumbled away from the prison gates, still sweating, shirt breezing against his ribs. His face was blackened and peeling and his body was agony, and yet he didn't care. The air tasted cool and fresh, and he was outside. Free. That was all that mattered. God had judged him innocent again. He staggered down the road until he came across a bus stop. Carl barely even knew the man he was accused of murdering, but they'd found his genetic material on the corpse. A single hair. That was enough to cede judgement to God. They had lived in the same city-complex. The hair could have just blown onto the dead man, from the street or... or maybe they'd brushed up against each other in a shop. That had been his initial argument. Plus the match had only been 99.99% -- room for doubt. ""God will decide,"" the arresting officer had said. No grin of satisfaction or grimace of remorse. The police might as well have been robots just following code. It wasn't their place to judge -- that was for God alone. Once upon a time, Carl had agreed with that system. Now he knew it was flawed. Heavily. Carl gave another bone-rattling cough. Even though the virus left him, it left its mark just as much as the prison ever did. E78-DS was a vile cellular disease that rotted the body from the inside. There had only ever been three known survivors. One woman and two men. His chances of survival -- of being judged innocent -- were almost zero. It had taken four months of drifting in and out of fever dreams for Carl to overcome it. The fact that he'd lived, that God had deemed him worthy, meant nothing to the prison guards. No apology, even, for what they'd done to someone judged innocent. ""No compensation?"" he asked. The warden laughed, gave him just enough credits for the bus, and sent him on his way. And now, under the dusky dawn sky, a bus squealed to a halt in front of him; the rusty door hissed open and he stepped inside. ""Evening,"" said Carl. The driver didn't make eye-contact so Carl just dropped his credits into the slot. The passengers sure looked at him, though. Eyed him up good, this feverish rotting remains of a man. Spread their luggage out onto their seats so that Carl couldn't sit next to them. Whatever he had, they sure didn't want to catch it. He couldn't blame them. Carl stood, holding firm onto a steel pole for balance, as the bus rumbled its way into the city-complex where he'd once lived. His apartment had been re-rented. Property couldn't be left empty for more than two weeks without it automatically changing ownership. Carl would have to apply for housing as soon as he could and sleep in the shelters until a new place came through -- if he wanted an apartment. But Carl had other plans. Instead of heading to the apartments where 99% of the population lived, he walked through the mega-domes on the east side of town, where the rich lived their different lives in protected, detached bubble-houses. Soon, he found it. Knocked the door. The woman who answered looked surprised, but only for a moment. Her face was grim and knowing as an executioner’s. She stepped back and invited him in. The first night they met a year ago, her face had been wet with furious tears. How the doctor who was meant to save her daughter’s life only ruined it. How he tottered out of the operating room, smelling like a bar, and no one believed her. How God let the child waste away instead of saving her, while the doctor lived on. ""What'll you do with the money?"" she asked, as she counted out the credits. They glimmered a metallic blue in her hands. He thought about it. Half his fever dreams had been imagining how to spend it. ""Maybe I'll move onto a sea-yacht. Live in a little luxury for a while."" The woman looked up and down his face. ""I hope it was worth it,"" she said. He shrugged. ""Not the first time I've been through it. Fourth time, actually."" She nodded. She'd barely believed him when he'd made her the offer. Surely no one could really survive it? And yet here Carl was. ""Going to get the face done up again first,"" he said. ""Get a new identity. I was careless to get caught, and I don't want to be monitored."" ""You're going to do it again, aren't you?"" It. The world heavied the air all around. Neither one of them could say the truth of it: murder. Divine judgment. Stepping in where God would not. Carl considered. ""Yes."" ""Why? You've enough money to live on. To live well."" ""Because the doctor got away with it."" ""Yes,"" she said. ""My daughter, though..."" ""She got eternity. You were right to confess to me,"" he said. ""But there are others that God has failed to judge correctly. I won’t fail as He has."" He turned to leave. ""Wait!"" He paused, palm on the door handle. ""Did he suffer?"" ""Not as much as I did."" ""Why do you do it?"" she asked. ""It's not for the money, is it?"" He used to be a priest. Used to listen to confessions and judge his flock, on behalf of a God who radiated righteousness. Who never made mistakes. His first murder had been of a man in his flock who had done something truly terrible to someone too young. God had judged that man innocent. Carl had not. Would not. His faith in God, and in man, had cracked that day. A rock thrown onto a thin sheet of ice. Carl had been arrested for the murder -- although he had not been Carl back then -- and injected with E78-DS. It was meant to be a death sentence. It had taken him almost a year to recover, and for most of that time he'd wanted to die. Begged God to take him. But he didn't die -- the only known person at the time to survive. He was proclaimed innocent. God's second error. It didn't take him that long anymore. His body grew more immune to it each time. All his immune cells rushing like soldiers to the ramparts. His penance becoming ever less.  ""Carl?"" the lady asked. He opened the door and stepped out into the night. Carl was gone. --- More of my writing on /r/nickofstatic",4387
ioanmu,"**tl;dr:** [**me write good book, pls read**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HKV1KNB) \~   \~   \~ Good morning! I'm willing to bet that most of you won't remember my novel's origin prompt, though you might recognize me from stories such as [the one where a man must face four judges in the afterlife.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/bj3c3e/wp_when_you_die_you_wait_in_purgatory_until_you/) After all, it was over four years ago! This was the prompt, if you want to take a look and see how poorly I wrote back then ;) >[”You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming. Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/43mjo9/wp_you_possess_the_ability_of_persistent_lucid/) It went from a terrible five part miniseries, to a Wattpad hopeful, to nothing as I lost motivation and drowned in work through the years, until finally I straightened myself out and rewrote the whole manuscript starting last year. And now, somehow, here we are. I'm both humbled and proud to present *Lost in a Dream*, a novel that actually adheres pretty closely to the prompt even after all of the rewriting and deep edits. Here is the blurb from the rear cover: >**If dreaming is a drug, then I'm a junkie.**   >   >For most people, sleeping is an obstacle. Something to get out of the way, so they can get back to their life. For others, it's an escape to nothing; a blissful break from the wears of life.   >   >It's the opposite for me.   >   >I live so that I can dream. I trudge through work so that I can go home and close my eyes, awakening in the real world—one where dreams do come true. A place where I can fight a dragon instead of my ever-disappointed boss, where I’m a warrior instead of a glorified telemarketer. A place where I matter.   >   >Tigers instead of taxes. Monsters instead of men with too much power.   >   >Reality is just the word we came up with to accept a mundane life. A birthing place for grander ideas we so desperately wish could come true.   >   >I choose to live in a world where they do. I’ll also share a few quick bits about the book: *Lost in a Dream* is a lovechild of literary fiction and fantasy; it's likely considered portal fantasy, but leans more toward the literary side thematically. * The cover art was done by Flor Figueroa over at Fiverr - look into her work if you want awesome minimalist cover art! * The novel is a shred under 74,000 words, so it's not a book you can club people with. Sorry. * It is a standalone novel--there won't be a sequel. I do, however, already have my next books planned. * *Lost in a Dream* is my first published work!

That’s not to say you’re extraordinary, necessarily—you might be. Chances are you’re more so than me, at the least, but that’s not much of a feat. Rather, we are each little universes of thought, infinite in expanse yet bound by flesh; pioneers lost in our own minds. Every human is a wellspring of possibility and impossibility, every breath a wish for something greater as we run desperate from the impending dark. We are, in a sense, prisoners to ourselves. Slaves to dreams we may well never grab hold of, working to the bone so that one day the schism between what we want and what we have might narrow ever so slightly. It is no surprise that every night we shut down for a brief reprieve, where we get a taste of the strange workings inside our heads. A glimpse into the potential we each have, raw as it may be. When we aren’t asleep, exploring our own dreams, we look to those of others. Snippets of what it’s like to live in someone else’s mind; pretty portals to vast, new, and often beautiful worlds, or ones so terrible and forlorn that anything seems tolerable when compared. Something—anything—to distract from the one that we’re in. To feel greater than ourselves. After all . . . isn’t that why you’re here? # ~ ~ ~ *Is it greed to desire something grand?* I often asked myself things like that as I killed someone. Many lives have been forever reduced to similar questions that fade in and out like fireflies on a dark summer night—what’s ironic is that putting a sword through a neck is so much easier than finding the answers. It shouldn’t be, right? Just reach out and grab one of the little lightbugs and put it in a jar to study later . . . but every time I try, they vanish. All I get is a fistful of darkness. By the time I was done thinking about all of that, there was only one other person breathing in the field before me: the man who had killed my family. My friends. My clansmen. I’d have cried looking at him if that well hadn’t dried up so long before; screamed if there were any leftover rage to burn. ""You're strong, Kinghunter,"" Ilhor Drago snarled, a hulking man in shimmering ebony armor patterned with wispy typhoons of cream and oxblood. He must’ve stood seven feet tall. ""But this is my home, and I'll not die here like some flame you'd snuff out with a shovel of dirt."" He peered at me through two clusters of holes in a solid iron headpiece, describable only as a perforated bucket. The rest of his battalion littered the wood-lined meadow like smashed tin cans. They'd made quite a morbid medium for my art, shades of death tainting the lush, fertile forest around us, painting fern and flower slick with a contrasting crimson. In the holy glow of spring's sun, amidst a field paint-brushed with trampled fuchsia tulips and peonies that dribbled out of the treeline, the bloodied plants almost looked at home. Ilhor charged at me, and I backpedaled toward the lake's muddy shore while keeping my sword raised overhead. Ilhor would be a challenge, no doubt—perhaps even worth three whole questions—but challenges are meant to be overcome, even if that challenge was once the most feared knight in any kingdom. A man known for cleaving children in two might terrify most, but I’d have fought God himself if that’s what it would’ve taken to put an end to Hadrian’s reign. *What will I do when all of this is over?* His footwork was perfectly placed with excellent tempo; he had the speed of a fox despite swelling with brutish strength, bowing the boundaries of human limits as if they physically couldn't contain his mass. Each swing of his enormous weapon left my own feeling heavier and heavier in hand, every metallic crack a seismic spasm that rang my soul like a church bell. I ducked and weaved through his razing, slowly backstepping to dodge; parrying had become too taxing on my aching palms. With each lurch forward, he churned huge piles of mud, flinging it around us. Though he was slowed, the length of his broadsword kept me from making a clean retreat. *Is there a place left in the world for someone like me?* Not only was I reduced to defense, but the stout cascade of steel he donned had virtually no openings, aside from under the armpits and a small gap beneath his helmet—one just big enough to slip a thin, thirsty blade into. Another swing, another step, retreating further and further until I could avoid parrying no more and our swords locked with spark and screech. He grabbed me with a single hand that touched its fingers together at the nape of my neck, feet desperately reaching for the ground as he lifted me into the air. I must've looked to pedal myself airborne. *Why am I so damn good at this?* “Why did you come here?” Ilhor asked, though he didn’t care to relax his grip. “I defected. I defected!” My words barely squeezed out between his fingers. “Hadrian wouldn’t let a defector live. Did you think an early retirement would save you?” “How did you even find this place? He promised me it was safe!” “Nowhere—” I punched at his giant gauntlets like a child, gasping. “—is safe.” He grunted twice; once at me, and once at the ground. With our weight combined, he sank past his ankles into the soft, dense mud that lined the lake's western shore. He dropped me, hoping it wasn’t too late, then yanked at them fruitlessly—an alligator has strength on the close, not open. I lunged, but his sword slammed into mine and sent it flying further into the forest than reality should allow, nesting into the canopy with a grating *buzz* like a silver beetle. A pained screech and flurry of wings rang out, followed by a distant, wooden *thunk*. Before I could look back in disdain, his blade was thrusting straight at my heart. I ducked, twisting, and barely managed to get low enough for it to deflect off my mail, then grabbed his wrists and pushed forward with all my weight to outstretch his arms. I only had a second before he'd overwhelm me, but that was all I needed. A small dagger, its polished gold hilt adorned with rubies, was partially hidden at his hip under a small flap of fraying linen. I let go of his off-hand, dropped even lower and grabbed it, then released his sword hand and pushed forward. In a blur of motion, I jammed the dagger into the thin gap between his helmet and breastplate just as his massive python of a left arm snapped at me again. A weary stumble backward was enough to escape his reach. He struggled and sucked at the air, his words wet with blood. “I’m . . . not even . . . a king. . . .” “How many innocent people did you kill for one?” I whispered, hacking off his head. *That was for you, Ophelia. For our little ones.* He plummeted into the coast, sinking into it a little bit. After a moment to collect myself, taking a few deep breaths, I was free to finally loot his body—a vulture hungry for the treasure I could smell on him. Out of a covered compartment at his right hip, I pulled out a golden scroll with reverence, cupping it in my hands and brushing my thumbs across its complex network of embossed vines. It was the fifth one I'd stolen, and it was every bit as mesmerizing as the first, glowing as though the sun itself had been laid out in my still aching palms. I knelt there for some time, drinking its glow, and aches melted to memory with each moment. Eventually, I found it within myself to forfeit worship and tuck it into a satchel at my waist. My fugitive beetle-sword was stuck in a tree nearly twenty yards away, with traces of blood on and around it. Splintered branches and shredded leaves littered the area, but there were no signs of life—or death—anywhere. I yanked it out, apologized to anything I may have harmed in Dominaria Forest, and ran back to the lake's edge. *Hidden. No patrols, no shipments, no trade. Forest for miles on all sides. How ironic that your pet’s hiding place has become mine, Hadrian. It'll need a little cleanup, to say the least, but maybe this can be somewhere my roots can anchor.* *A place to belong.* As I approached the castle, stepping over bodies like they were nothing more than fallen branches after a storm, a light, playful voice caught me off-guard. ""What a shame—I wanted to kill him."" I spun, reflexively unsheathing my sword to flare wary steel. A woman emerged from behind bark, crossing her arms and leaning lazily against the tree she'd been using for cover. Her weapon was unattended, dangling with a laxness inherited from its owner. ""I was rooting for you to lose, but your fighting skills are impressive. You're not like the others I’ve run into around here,"" she continued, her gaze sharper than a blade fresh off of whetstone, her lips hinting at a smirk. I smiled as a cool breeze slid through thick trees, relaxing. ""Yeah. You seem . . . different, somehow. You seem real.""",Congrats!

kxuju3,"Hello everyone! To repeat what the title said, (and get the full prompt, since it wouldn’t quite fit), two years ago I responded to this prompt: \[WP\] [You're a powerful dragon that lived next to a small kingdom. For centuries you ignored humanity and lived alone in a cave, and the humans also avoided you. As the kingdom fell to invaders, a dying soldier approaches you with the infant princess, begging you to take care of her](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/813gcd/wp_youre_a_powerful_dragon_that_lived_next_to_a/) Well, I took that idea and decided the “invaders” weren’t of the “Across the mountain” kind and instead were the “from another world time,” and thus was born The Dragon’s Scion, a trilogy of books dealing with the the dragon-raised and empowered princess’s war against the alien invaders. Book one, *Dragonflame,* is out now, with more to follow in the coming months! Read the blurb below! \--- **Tythel thought growing up under the wings of the last dragon, Karjon the Magnificent, would be the most unusual part of her life. It was only the beginning.** Finally, she’s come of age to begin her transformation into a half dragon. But just as the ritual completes, a steel ship bursts from the clouds, killing the dragon and tearing her world asunder. The attack leaves Tythel alone and on the run from the alien invaders. The same ones that conquered her world and killed her parents sixteen years ago. The rightful heir to the throne and the last draconic being, Tythel must use every tool at her disposal to survive and teach the aliens a lesson forged in flame. They should have let sleeping dragons lie. *Dragonflame is an epic science-fantasy adventure.* \--- ***FAQ*** **Audiobook/Print Copy?** Print Copy is coming soon. For audiobook, nothing yet announced, but I’ll update if there is one! **Is this science fiction or fantasy?** Both, but in a different direction. Most science fantasy deals with science fiction tech and space wizards, and while I love me my space wizards, this goes the other way - the technology is powered by magic, the aliens use their own magic that isn’t just Sufficiently Advanced Technology, and the entire story takes place on a single fantasy world that the aliens invaded. **Length?** *Dragonflame* clocks in at just about 95k words, which makes it about 300 pages in print. **Elves and Dwarves?** Not exactly. There are the Sylvani and the Underfolk. Sylvani are woods-dwelling people, but they also have the ability to alter their skin appearance and texture and have mysterious origins, and the Underfolk don’t appear in book 1 but will in book 2, and they share “lives underground” with dwarves but take it in a vastly different direction. **I read this on your subreddit, what’s different?** In addition to a completely new introduction/prologue, I’ve applied many of the lessons I’ve learned writing Dragon’s Scion and other books over the last two years, and the prose is cleaner and better fleshed out, as well as some minor changes to fix early installment weirdness. **Age range?** The Dragon’s Scion deals with mature themes and has some racy jokes, but also has no real-world swears, no sex, and injuries are not described in overly-graphic detail. It’s PG-13 in movie land, and acceptable for ages 14+. **Sequels?** This book is part of a trilogy, and I'm looking to have book 2 - *Ghostflame -* out in mid Feb, early march. **Purge the xeno!** Not a question and not quite the right tone, but I like the enthusiasm. You can pick it up here!

This was not the first horse the guardsman had ridden since leaving the city. The others had perished on the journey. He hadn’t even purchased this horse. Having long ago discarded his tabard and armor, this guardsman wore thick furs to keep out the bitter cold. Between that and the wild look in his eyes, he looked less like a guardsman and more like a bandit. It was fitting, in a way, that the third and final horse he rode was stolen. His name was Comber, and he had been part of the troop assigned to protect the royal family against all threats. For ten years he had stood his post, alongside the royal family’s Umbrists. Comber didn’t have the Shadow-infused powers of the Umbrist. He had armor that had been forged with steel mixed with light, and a sword that had been blessed millennia ago with a dragon’s breath. That was in the past. He had a vow to protect the royal family against any and all threats. He’d fought when the minions of a necromancer had snuck in through the sewers. He still had a scar on his thigh from an assassin’s crossbow bolt meant for the King. He was not a coward, and he had thought himself beyond fear. That was also in the past. Comber looked over his shoulder. His pursuers weren’t there. He was alone here. There was nothing but a path through the woods, a path that had been cleared by game hunters who would head this way. It took a bold man to hunt in these woods, given what guarded them. The same being that drew Comber deeper within. His last hope for salvation. The skies darkened, and Comber risked a glance upwards. There it was. That hole in the sky. The sun had passed behind it, casting a momentary shadow across the world. It was like the eclipse Comber remembered from when he was a child, but there was still light coming from the center. Small points showing stars unlike any he had seen before. A few tiny dots broke off from the main circle. Comber shuddered at the sight. He’d seen what those dots could do when they got lower. The bundle in his arms stirred when he shivered again, and looked up at him with bright green eyes. Awake now, the child’s face was placid for just a moment, those beautiful eyes flickering about. Then hunger set in, and the child started to wail. “Shhh, little one,” Comber whispered, stroking the side of the child’s face. “Shhh.” Still the child cried. She was just old enough to eat mashed food. Comber grimaced and looked around again. There was no one present. “Shhh,” Comber said, pulling on the reins of the horse. He reached into his pack. He still had some berries from the last town, and got to work mashing them into a paste with a mortar and pestle. At her age, the child had just enough understanding of what that smell and sound meant, and her cries turned to excited cooing as she reached towards his hands. “Almost there, little one,” Comber said. Or at least, he started to say. Halfway through the wound in his side reminded him of why he’d abandoned his sword, and Comber hissed in pain. Even the simple motion of grinding berries was too much for him. He set the mortar down carefully. He hadn’t been able to get a spoon in his mad flight. The child was able to suckle the paste off his finger, and that would have to be good enough. Once she’d been fed, Comber held her with one hand and pulled the other inside his coat. He ran his fingers over the hasty bandage. It was damp. He wanted to look at the injury, but didn’t dare. He knew what he’d find. Black veins sprawling outwards from under the bandage, creeping along his skin. Last night, the veins had been halfway to his chest. Soon they would reach his heart. He’d die then. Comber didn’t need to be a Physician to know that. The child reached up and grabbed for his nose with hands wrapped in mittens. Comber let her grab it, then pressed his forehead to hers. “Soon, you’ll be safe,” Comber whispered to her. Then it was time to transition the child to the straps wrapped around his chest, freeing his hands, and Comber resumed his ride to the mountain. \*\*\* The horse - Comber had never bothered giving it a name - came to a stop, and the jolt rocked Comber awake. He blinked around blearily. He’d fallen asleep in the saddle somehow. Everything felt like it had been coated in a layer of wool. Comber worked one of his hands free of the glove and pressed it against his forehead. In spite of the cold, heat radiated from the touch. “Fever,” he muttered to the child. “Bah-bah-bah-bah,” she said, which Comber took as affirmation. He smiled down at her, then looked around again. They’d reached the mountain. “We go no further together,” he said to the horse. Comber had never been one to speak to his mounts, aside from commands. He preferred to make noises at them, reassuring ones. But in the grip of fever, Comber felt irrationally sorry for abandoning an animal he’d only had for a day. A stolen one, at that. “You’ll be able to find your way back to town, won’t you? Or maybe you’ll be able to run free now, without the need...the need…” Comber trailed off. What had he been doing? Talking to a horse, that’s what. They were close to the base of the mountain, but not quite there. He could see it. Perhaps he could ride the horse a little bit further? He dug his heels in. The horse let out a huff of air and shook its head, instead backing up a few paces. “Of course,” Comber said, shaking his head. “Of course. A horse. A horse of course.” He laughed a bit. It wasn’t funny, but the child joined in the laughter. He patted the side of the horse’s neck again. “You smell it, don’t you?” The horse shook its head violently and took another step back. That was all the confirmation Comber needed. The horse would go no further. “You know,” Comber said, getting ready to dismount. “I should have known. They eat you, don’t they?” The horse did not respond this time, for it was a horse, and all it cared about was that it didn’t need to go any further. Comber got one foot out of the stirrup, but the world started to spin. Instead of dismounting gracefully, Comber swung drunkenly, and collapsed into the snow. He had just enough presence of mind to turn around as he fell, landing on his back to keep the child safe. Comber growled in pain as the impact lanced through his back. The shock did wonders for clearing his head. The child, jostled by the fall, poked her head up and giggled. “That’s right,” Comber grunted. “I’m silly, aren’t I?” The child reached up for him, grasping for him. Comber put his finger out for her to hold onto. He’d abandoned his station, and he knew he should feel guilty about that, but…the beings that had come from that hole in the sky were beyond anything that could be fought. Arrows bounced off their gleaming carapace. Swords were deflected with swipes from their unnatural hands. He had a duty, and he could only save one person. He’d chosen her. Comber rose to his feet and turned the horse around. It only took a nudge to get the horse trotting away from the mountain. It would live. The child would live. That would have to be enough. Comber made himself walk towards the mountain. Every footstep was like lead. He spotted a trail in the snow - someone else had come this way and left. They were human, or at least walked like one. It could be an Underfolk or Sylvani. It wasn’t the invaders. That much was certain. No one could mistake their skittering legs for human footsteps. The mountain, at least, was free of snow. Impossibly free, and impossibly warm. A fire burned in the heart of this mountain. Not the molten fire of a volcano. A living flame. A hungering flame. Had the fever started sooner than Comber realized? He’d been so certain of this plan. He’d heard tales of the flame that lived in this mountain. The tales had made it out to be one of the ones that did not feast on the flesh of Man or the other Intelligent Races. They said it had stood alongside the forces of the Light and Shadow against dread powers in the past. They said it was not to be disturbed, but would not slay - except for those that came to attack it. But still...could he trust it? It was too late now. There was nowhere else he was certain would be safe for the child. Not with that locket, secured carefully in a pouch in the swaddling. Even without it...would anywhere be safe from the invaders? Would anything? They hadn’t been killing innocents. They’d killed armies, they’d slaughtered guards, but any who did not pick up blade or spear against them was spared their wrath. Yet...Comber didn’t trust them to stop there. It was possible - nay, it seemed likely - that they were just starting with those that posed a threat to them. “Not that we did,” he said to the child, who paused in her attempts to gum his finger to look up at him. “I hope, if you remember nothing else, you remember that we tried. We tried.” “Burrrbl,” the child said happily. “We tried,” Comber repeated. And they had. Nicandros, the captain of the royal guard, had commanded them perfectly. However, no strategy could overcome the fact that their weapons did no harm to the invaders. That was when Comber realized the only option was saving what he could. That there would be no victory here. Still, Comber had fought, until his wound. Then...he’d been even more useless in battle. Time became unstable. Comber kept walking up the warm mountain and its bare stones. It was a gentle slope, which was the only reason he could progress at all. Ahead, he saw his goal. A hole, high up the mountain. One far larger than would be needed for a man to pass through, and one too smooth and round to be the result of nature. This was not a cave. It was a lair. Comber stumbled and dropped to his knees. The child started to wail again, startled by the jostling. Comber tried to shush its cries, but he was too late. Something was stirring in the lair, dragging itself forth from the depths. Comber saw golden eyes peering out of the darkness, followed by red scales and immense, bat-like wings. Comber had never seen a dragon in person. Only flying overhead, and even then, such sights were rare. He’d expected them to crawl across a ground, like a lizard, but this one slunk with a cat’s grace. An older cat, one that was past its prime hunting days, but still possessing enough energy to move about. The dragon flapped its wings and took to the air, circling around Comber once before landing. “I told Lathariel I would not be disturbed,” the dragon growled, and Comber was certain he’d made a mistake. Tears started to form in his eyes, unbidden. “Please…” Comber said, but the dragon shook its head. “I will not fight.” The dragon looked up, seeing the hole in the sky, and its nostrils flared. For a moment, Comber could see it considering...then it shook its head again. “I will not fight,” it repeated. “Leave this threat for younger drakes. Ones that have hotter flames.” “Please…” Comber said again, then coughed. Flecks of something black came with the cough, and Comber moved with speed he didn’t know he still had, pulling the child free of the path of whatever those were. He groaned in pain and nearly blacked out. “You are injured,” the dragon said, leaning down. “And you are ill.” Comber nodded. “I can heal your injuries,” the dragon said, after considering for a moment. “But my flames will make the disease spread quicker.” “Not...me.” Comber coughed again. “Her.” The dragon looked at the child. “She’s uninjured,” he said. “Care...protect.” Comber’s vision grew dark. “She...she...is.” Comber’s vision narrowed. “She is...everything....” The dragon was barely visible now. The world was barely visible. The child stirred, looking from the dragon to Comber and back again, starting to make distressed noises. She didn’t fear the dragon. That was good. But she could tell something was wrong. “I’m sorry,” Comber said to the child. He looked back up at the dragon. His vision was barely there anymore. He’d gone so far. It felt like part of his mind had been set on fire, to hold back death, and now that he was here, that flame had gone out. “Tell her…” Comber said, and then he started to cough again. “She is…” “What should I tell her she is?” the dragon asked, after Comber had been silent for too long. When he got no response, the dragon Karjon leaned down. The man’s heartbeat had been so faint when he’d approached, Karjon could barely hear it. Now, though? Now there was nothing. And the child started to cry. Karjon looked at it. He’d never dealt with human children before. He knew they needed more comfort than hatchlings. Uncertain, Karjon reached out with one claw and retracted his talon, then brushed his scales on the child’s cheek. Quick as a viper, the child grabbed Karjon’s finger tightly, trying to seek some comfort in a world that had abandoned her. Karjon sighed. He had not had children of his own. He hadn’t planned on doing so. But...if nothing else, he could not leave this child to starve on his mountain. He carefully bit on the swaddling, making certain to only let his fangs touch the fabric. Once these invaders had been dealt with, Karjon would take the child to the nearest humans. They would know how to handle her. He’d keep her safe until then. It shouldn’t be long. There had been many threats over his nine hundred years of life. They’d always been defeated. There was no reason to believe this would be any different. # Chapter 1 “I have lived for centuries,” Karjon growled. “I dueled the Necromancer Gix and his army of undead. I was on the Council of Twelve, battling the Lichborne. When the mad Lumcaster sought to blind the world, I doused him in my flames. How is it that nothing has vexed me as much as you, little one?” Tythel looked up at the dragon with eyes wide in feigned innocence. Sixteen years had passed since the mountain and the snow. She didn’t remember it, of course. Just as she did not remember what her name had been before coming here. Tythel was a dragon’s name, not a human name. For all Karjon’s bluster, she was not worried. In sixteen years, Karjon had never raised a claw in anger. “Father, have you considered that it is just because you love me so dearly?” Karjon huffed and shook his head. “That cannot be it. I think it *must* be because I did not know how *vexing* your unique subspecies of humans can be.” “Subspecies?” Tythel asked. “Yes. Those strange beings humans call ‘adolescents.’ Or perhaps it is just a trait unique to daughters.” Tythel beamed at him. The expression only came through with her eyes. In her books, humans would use their mouths to do things like smile and frown. Tythel understood, in theory, what those were, but the expressions didn’t come to her naturally. From what Karjon had said, she’d smiled and frowned at first...but with time, those had stopped. Now, she blinked rapidly to show her excitement. “Which would only matter because you love me. Therefore, I am still correct. And, since I *am* correct, I see no reason I should not be allowed to go.” Karjon sighed heavily. “Tythel…” “You said I could,” Tythel reminded him, trying her best not to sound sullen. “I told you that, yes,” Karjon said. “I said you could go when it was safe.” “I want to see other humans,” Tythel said. “Why can’t I go?” Karjon sighed again, a sound that filled the entire cave that was his lair and their home. “When, exactly, did ‘because I said so’ become insufficient?” “When I stopped being a child,” Tythel said. “You said when I was sixteen, I could go and see other humans.” “I said that you could go into the village when you were sixteen, Tythel. I did not say you could do so the very next day.” Making that promise, back when she was nine, had been a mistake. He’d done it to get her to cease her incessant questions. He didn’t think humans of that age could *remember* things for so long. “You’re splitting scales and you know it.” She folded her arms across her chest and glowered at him. Karjon, who weighed in at just over six tons and had battled some of the greatest foes the world had ever seen, broke the staring contest first. Tythel tried not to blink when she realized that meant she was getting through to him. For all his fury and might, Karjon had always struggled to deny her anything. Still, he was not caving like he usually did. “Tythel, there are reasons for the choices I make. They are for your safety.” “You always hide behind that, father. Are you planning on keeping me here the rest of my life? What are you hiding me *from?*” “There are those out there that would see you dead. Is that not enough explanation?” She glowered at him again. “You know I can’t do anything if you don’t tell me. But if you want me to leave it alone, you’ll need to give me more than that.” Her expression softened. “Please, father.” Karjon settled down onto the pile of coins that made his seat. Tythel took the cue and walked over to her own, smaller pile. She didn’t have a hoard of her own. Not yet. But she would one day, although she was less than eager for that day. Dragons did not share a hoard. She’d have to leave that day, never to live here again. “Perhaps…” Karjon started to say, then held up a claw to forestall her before she got too excited. “It is time you know of the dangers beyond this lair. Why I keep you hidden here. And tomorrow…” he studied her critically for a moment, then nodded. “You are old enough.” “To go visit?” Tythel asked hopefully. “Not yet,” Karjon said, shaking his head. “But tomorrow, I think you are ready for the one thing I know you want more than to leave.” Tythel sat up straighter, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “You mean...you’ll finish the adoption?” Karjon nodded, and Tythel leapt up to run over and wrap her arms around her father’s neck. “Thank you thank you thank you!” There were tears forming in her eyes, a human reaction she hadn’t shed with age, but these were tears of joy and not sadness. “It’s past time,” Karjon said. “I just worried about how your body would react to the transformation.” “I know,” Tythel said, although deep in her heart, she’d worried that he wouldn’t do it. That she wasn’t good enough. She’d never told Karjon that. If it wasn’t true, it would have broken his heart. If it was true...she couldn’t have handled that. Now, though, she was practically vibrating with anticipation. Karjon put one of his claws around her, in his version of a hug. From what he’d said, dragons did not engage in touch the way humans did, but one of his books had told him a lack of touch and affection could kill human infants. Deep down, Tythel suspected he had grown to like it himself. “Now. Will you listen, and will you wait?” Tythel nodded firmly. “Then do so,” Karjon said, and Tythel settled back onto her coins. “Sixteen years ago, just days before you were brought to me...the skies let loose monsters.” “Monsters?” Tythel asked. Karjon nodded. “I do not know if they have a name. I know what Lathariel told me they were being called ‘Those From Above.’ They had weapons that sucked in light and spewed forth their own unnatural energy. Unlight, she called it.” “And you fought them?” Tythel asked, excitedly. Karjon shook his head, and in his eyes Tythel could see sorrow she’d never imagined from her father. “I am old,” Karjon said. “I thought they could be defeated without me. Even when I was told dragonflame was all that would harm them...I still thought they could be defeated. There were other dragons. By the time I realized...it was too late. Those From Above had secured power over humanity. They rule down there now. As far as I know, they only fear dragonflame.” Tythel held up a hand and focused. A ball of flame formed between her fingers. “They fear this?” she asked. Dragonflame was similar to normal fire, but more vibrant. The transition from white to yellow to orange to red that happened in a normal flame was marked by clearer lines. Hers was weak. Not close to the true power of a dragon. She could barely call upon it, and couldn’t even touch the greater fires of ghostflame or heartflame. But it was not nothing. “Yes,” Karjon said, and there was a somber note to his voice that Tythel couldn’t ignore. “By healing you when you injured yourself...you already formed the gift.  They will hunt you. For that and...for other reasons.” “What other reasons?” Karjon shook his head. “Not yet. There is much I have kept from you. You are old enough now, but...before that there’s something you need to understand.” He put one claw carefully on her knee. “Tythel...tomorrow, after the Ascension, the number of dragons in the world will go from one to two.” Tythel stared at her father for a long moment, processing his words. She’d never met another dragon, but the idea there had been other dragons out there...she’d just assumed it. Realizing they’d been hunted down, there was only one thing to do. She hugged Karjon again, and her father hugged her back. They sat there for a moment, before both of them could steady themselves enough to speak. “Tythel,” Karjon said. “I…have kept something else from you.” “It’s so much,” Tythel whispered. Karjon cocked his head. “Do you need time before the rest?” Tythel considered for a moment, then shook her head. “A scholar’s first duty is to acquire all information before passing judgement,” Tythel said, repeating one of her father’s lessons back to him. Karjon gave her a slow blink of amusement. “You listen too well sometimes. Very well. Your locket.” Tythel’s hands went up to the chain around her neck. She’d worn it as long as she could remember. It was the one piece of her own hoard she had.  “You said it was my parents.” Karjon nodded. “That locket is the other reason you will be hunted. It is the locket of the royal family.” There was a moment of silence as Tythel stared at her father. “The…the royal family. But they…I mean…that’s…” Tythel sputtered off into silence. She couldn’t say it. “I’m…” Karjon nodded, the motion oddly gentle. “You are the heir to the throne of your family. The throne of the kingdom of Dretayne. You are the next queen of this realm. And for that, you will be hunted as one of the barriers to the rule of Those from Above.” Tythel took a deep, ragged breath, then nodded slowly. She couldn’t think about it right now. She could barely understand it. So she fell back on the lessons of her childhood. A scholar's first duty. “Tell me everything.” \*\*\* Tythel did not sleep well that night. She tried to, doing every meditation technique Karjon had taught her over the years, but she spent the entire night tossing and turning. The bed she slept on was one Karjon had gotten as a trophy from the Underfolk, those strange underground folk that were in Karjon’s stories, and it had been perfect for her when she was a child. But for the last two years, she’d been forced to scrunch up on it, leading to the impression the Underfolk were likely quite small. In truth, Tythel was taller than most humans. Sixteen years of eating a diet of meat cooked in dragonflame and lifting and moving gold on a regular basis had left her with a build that was less princess and more warrior, but since the only humans she’d seen had been in her imagination, she’d had no idea how imposing a figure she could cut when she wasn’t comparing herself to a dragon. She’d never complained to Karjon about the small bed. Other things, sure, but never that – or any of the other things he’d provided to her over the years. Tythel had known how lucky she’d been to have a dragon for a father. Karjon’s stories were full of tales of the legendary heroes of the past, Calcon the Brave and Rilan the Just and Brigith the Nobel and all the rest of them. All of them had started their lives as humble folk that had heeded the Call, which meant their lives had been the humdrum work of farmers and blacksmiths and other folk, and the stories all made that life out to be terribly dull. She’d always imagined Karjon had rescued her from that sort of suffering. Now she knew differently. She would have been a princess, daughter to a king and queen, living a life of luxury and wealth and, if the legends were any indication, would have either ended up spoiled rotten or kidnapped by someone to later be rescued. Other than that her life would have been one of formality and circumstance until she was married off to secure an alliance or to whoever had been strong enough to save her, regardless of their other qualities. Tythel decided that, small bed aside, she still felt lucky to have been raised by Karjon. That feeling was quickly followed by shame at even considering an alternative. She got out of bed and pulled her blankets and pillows to the floor, arranging them in a pile like the gold Karjon slept on. It wasn’t as comfortable as the bed, but it did allow her to stretch out, and that was preferable to being cramped into the bed at the moment. The problem was, it wasn’t the bed keeping her up tonight. It was her mind. Tythel had been on top of the mountain a few times every year, under Karjon’s careful eye. He had explained that if she didn’t get to see the sky every now and then, she’d probably go mad. The village had always fascinated her, and her entire life she’d wanted to go there, just for a day, to explore and celebrate. She wanted to see horses and soldiers and blacksmiths and maybe even a lumcaster if she was really lucky. Karjon had taught her some magic, the barest flicker of dragonflame, but it was not magic meant for humans. Of course, that would change tomorrow. Well, her being human – she didn’t know if she’d gain any proficiency with her meager powers in the process. She’d have Karjon’s power running through her veins, becoming half dragon and half human. For most of her life, it had been the one thing she’d wanted more than going to the village. *The village.* She turned over again. From the mountain, it had been hard to make out details. She’d filled in those details in her head with ones stolen from her stories – thatched roofs covering star-crossed lovers, barns harboring hard working folk with wisdom gained from years of honest toil, scholars in cramped quarters trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, chimneys smoking with fires that were roasting chickens or beef. Never in her life had she imagined the people out there were being subjected to tyrants that had more power than she could imagine. Never, not once, had she imagined that she was their ruler by a mere quirk of birth. That thought got her turning again. Karjon’s stories had talked about something called “noblesse oblige,” the responsibilities that the nobility had to their people. Protect them, help them, guide them, and care for them. If she was a noble – a royal – didn’t the same thing apply to her? *Stop it, Tythel. Stop it.* But the thought wouldn’t go away. If she stayed here with Karjon, she was failing in her responsibility. The sixteen years leading up to this had not been her fault; she hadn’t known she had duties. After a moment of reflection, she decided they weren’t Karjon’s fault either. They were the fault of the mysterious Those from Above. Now that she knew, however…well, Karjon had always taught her that inaction was still a choice, the choice to do nothing. Tomorrow, then, after the Ritual. She’d leave, no matter what. And if Karjon tried to stop her…well, then she’d have to do it alone. And that thought, more than any other, caused Tythel to burrow as deeply as she could into the blankets before sleep finally claimed her. \--- Want to know what happens next?

This lock is famous, invented at an unknown time BCE, and is what keeps souls from escaping the Underworld. As you can see here, the lock seems to be in the shape of a smiling, human-sized skull, with the mouth being where the key is inserted. The security seems to be provided not by its physical design but through a set of unknown supernatural parameters that must be fulfilled to open the lock, which only the Warden of the Underworld seems to fulfill. Fortunately, there seems to be a trick to opening this lock. It seems that the supernatural reinforcements on the lock are designed to make the skull impervious to any sort of damage or warping, so brute force would be impossible. The supernatural conditions are also set up to recognize the spiritual signatures of the Warden’s Key, so putting in a lock-picking device would result in a detection of your intrusion and your soul being consumed. However, the mechanism that opens the lock from the key is very weak and easy to exploit if you simply don’t use a lock-picking device and instead work from the outside of the lock. Here I’m going to do a technique called “rapping.” I have a simple urethane hammer and I’m going to hit the skull right here at the bottom right of its jawbone. One, two, three hits, and the lock comes off as you can see here. I’m going to relock it and show that one more time so you know it’s not a fluke. One, two, three, four hits that time and the lock comes off again. Okay folks, I’m going to escape from the Underworld now to upload this video so that’s all I have for you today. If you have any questions or comments about this, please put them below. If you liked this and want to see more, please subscribe, and as always, have a nice day. ___ r/WanderWilder",5216
