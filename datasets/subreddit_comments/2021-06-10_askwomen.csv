401lsp,"Background: I had the orange monopoly and she had the red monopoly. We both had two houses on each of our properties  I had enough money to land on one of her red spaces unless she went up to three houses. I was about to leave Jail, and had a good chance of landing on a red in two turns. She was on the green properties. To discourage her from building, I hid a stack of $100s underneath my $10s. She thought that I couldn't afford to build any more and that landing on her two house red properties would bankrupt me. After I safely passed her red monopolies, I took out my stack of $100s and built another house on each orange. She landed on New York and resigned because she would have to sell her houses to pay me.   Now she is angry and claims I cheated.

8ffc6l,"My mom (who’s been in several abusive relationships and has now been single for over 10 years) grew up with alcoholic parents. I’m going to write from her perspective: “Honey, you have to make sure you always have a plan for just yourself. When I was five, my parents were drunk and fighting again, and they were threatening divorce. They were ‘splitting up the kids’ (she had three older siblings) and saying who they wanted to take. My father wanted Lucy and Sarah, and my mother wanted Bill. And nobody picked me.  “I ran out the front door and laid down in our grass, looking up at the stars. I sang ‘Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star’ while crying, and then I said ‘I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.’ And I wished for my OWN man, one who would take care of me and love me and want me. And I thought because I put it out there into the universe, that it would happen. “I was always looking for MY man. I went through the rest of life looking for him. And he never came. And now I’ve accepted that he’s just not going to come.  “And sometimes I still look for him. At church today, I took a peek around. ‘Nope, no one here.’ I have to be okay with just being on my own.” Coming from my mother, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever heard. Mostly because I know it’s a reality and a possibility for me (and anyone else), and that she may be right. She may live the rest of her life alone.","my mom has always hated dogs and i never really questioned why. i knew she had a dog when she was little but i thought maybe it was mean or something and that’s why she didn’t like them. one day she told me her dad, who was a severe alcoholic and a complete asshole, came home drunk and mad and kept kicking the dog, and when he went to bed my mom laid on the floor with the dog while it died because she was too young to do anything.

8ukcp9,"I've been noticing recently that many famous and beloved romantic movies are full of these incredibly toxic behaviors, and am curious why they are so popular. For instance not taking no for an answer, in almost every romantic movie, the guy gets rejected at first, but keeps trying, eventually to ""win"" the girl over. The worst example of this is the Notebook, where he threatens to commit suicide unless the girl goes out with him. Many consider that movie to be the most romantic movie of all time, and I just want to know why?","Healthy relationships don't tend to be super interesting, don't create a lot of conflict to make a good plot.",2883

9raccf,"Wow thank you so much so many incredible, well thought out responses! I've been actually attempting to read them all, but for anyone who doesn't want to go through every one of them I will some up the main things I took away: - If you are planning on getting pregnant in your mid-thirties or later, it is smart to have fertility testing in your twenties or early thirties.  - Staying healthy is incredibly important. A lot of responses about having kids earlier say the benefit would be you and your parents are more active with them. I am very fortunate that I stay active and at nearly 70, both my parents are very healthy and energetic and could probably run circles around most people half their age. I can't imagine if my parents didn't take care of themselves and I had to worry about them passing away soon.   - Women who waited tend to have less financial stress and feel more patient with their kids - The downsides seem to be parents feeling more tired and worrying about having less time with their children and less time with grandparents (Sidenote from my experience: I never knew my grandfathers and while my mom has said she wishes I met her dad it was never a big deal to me.  I couldn't miss something I never had.  He died out of the blue too and that's just part of life. Unexpected things I happen and I don't want to rush into kids just out of fear my parents may die. I've talked to my mom about this and she fully supports it.  She's excited to be a grandma some day but says to never rush it just to give her and my dad grandkids.) Personally this has given me a ton of reassurance that I won't regret waiting til my late thirties for kids. My parents had me and my brother when they were comfortable and they provided us with an amazing life with financial stability and vacations and I want the same for my kids.  So I'll be getting my fertility tested and will be sure to stay as healthy as I can and not feel rushed.   ","I had my daughter when I was a couple months shy of 36.  My only regret in waiting is that it makes it unlikely that I will ever have more children of my own.  Otherwise, I was financially stable, had an established career, and was emotionally prepared to care for my little one.  I appreciate every moment I have with her and would do it all over again if I could.      When deciding to wait, I would take into account how many kids you want to have.  Also consider that you might not get pregnant right away.  I had a miscarriage shortly after we started trying and then it took another year before I got pregnant again.  ",3880

a0kzee,"Either a realization you came to on your own, or something your therapist said that made you understand something completely differently ","“Emotional incest”  It’s difficult to define and pin down but it’s a kind of emotional abuse that can look healthy from the outside, like you’re just close to your parents or “best friends,” but adults unloading adult concerns onto children makes those children grow up putting their needs last and always feeling inadequate. It makes you feel like the emotional parent of your parent, and steals your childhood. It explained why I instinctively withdraw from my parents when they want to talk to me. They turn me into their therapist and it feels gross. It becomes an easy dynamic to fall into when when parents have a strained relationship and/or are going through a divorce.

Even when people talk about women in a sexual and mature context they say girls. It surprises me how many people do this, it's so widespread. The equivalent of boys is girls, the equivalent of guys is girls again, the equivalent of men is women. There's not a casual equivalent for grown women like the term ""guys"".

At the time that I found it, I was DEEP into postpartum depression that lasted until my son was a year old.  Going through a divorce, being thrusted into single-parenthood, and not even knowing how to be with my son without wanting to kill him or myself was the worst experience I had ever been through. I was miserable, endangering my son, and furious that this man had put me through all of this.  The postpartum depression has now gone and I’ve healed from the anger, but my ex husband is barely in my son’s life so I am constantly the only parent he has physically, monetarily, and emotionally. I love him more than life itself, but I can’t exactly say that if I could do it all over, I would still choose to have gotten pregnant. I still daydream of the life I wanted on a daily basis. ",4295

b9bri4,Moving in with my wife and want to make her daily life as great as possible. ,"21 years later, and he's just as thoughtful as year 1. We have a high school freshman and a 6th grader as as children as well. We both work full time. *  Greets me at the door with coffee and ibuprofen if I text him about a bad day at work. (I work 12+ hour shifts and always get home later than him, but I have more days off.) * Makes dinner without me asking if I had a bad day, even if it's my night to cook. Doesn't ask for me to make it up. * Randomly texts me pictures of things he finds beautiful...sunrises, flowers, art, woodworking... * Is supportive with poor mental health days and treats it as kindly as he would a physical illness, like bringing me food, doing chores, or dealing with the kids. Never issues a judgement, even if the mental slump is a long one. * Never holds a grudge. If I mess up and we address and settle it, I never hear about it again, even if in a future fight, the past may be relevant. * No matter how busy he is, if I tell him I want to talk, even if it's just venting, he stops and focuses on the conversation. * He has always pulled his weight around the house and with childcare. I never had to ask...babies got changed and fed while I slept, vomit gets cleaned up, floor get vacuumed, laundry gets done...we both carry the weight, but he just does it without asking. * He has always fought fair, and because of how proactive he is, we actually rarely fight. I honestly cannot remember our last fight, and it's not because we are perfect, it's because we communicate before things can get big. * He believes in growth and change, which is why we are still together. We met at age 14, so if we both had not firmly believed that growth and change are important values, we wouldn't have lasted past the first few years (together since 17, married since 21).",3370

There’s honestly a lot I could say about this topic, but maybe I’ll just condense it down into one story.  A couple of years out of my abusive marriage, I was finally ready to date again. I met my current SO somewhere down the line. We’d been dating for a few weeks when one night, in his kitchen, I dropped one of his mugs as I was getting it out of the cupboard. It shattered on the ground.  Clumsiness like this was one of the endless list of things that had a high potential to set my ex-husband off. So I instantly reverted to the same behaviours I had cultivated to appease my ex’s anger, or just fearing it. I was crying, apologizing, kneeling on the floor frantically trying to scrape up the shards with my hands. Begging forgiveness. Telling my SO I would fix it, and it was all my fault, and I was so sorry. I was shaking. And then I look up and my SO is just kneeling next to me looking just sort of soft and concerned and says “hey, hey, it’s okay. It’s just a mug. Don’t worry about it.” And he grabs a dustpan and cleans it up, gives me a hug, then gets another mug and pours me a drink and we go back to the living room. And he never brought it up again and everything was cool.  And I was sitting there and having this unbelievable feeling, like a total revelation. I felt like I could breathe for the first time in years. I’d spent so long in a relationship where I was constantly holding my breath, constantly waiting to be berated or absolutely exploded with my husband’s anger, that I honestly had not really realized there was a life where you could drop a mug and your partner didn’t freak out on you.  That was one of the many things in my early relationship with my SO that helped me have concrete understanding of healthy behaviours and boundaries again. It was seeing that I could make mistakes or have accidents and my SO not only didn’t punish me, but frankly didn’t think it was a big deal, because he could deal with his emotions like a healthy and non-violent adult.  So for me that was the differences I observed: it was literally feeling like I could breathe freely in my relationship. It was simply realizing I was no longer in fear all the time for what might happen, because there was nothing to be afraid of, and even if my SO does get mad or sad or whatever sometimes I am not afraid of it because it won’t be used against me.",2766

degam8,Just wanted to get the female perspective from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/9r7aqp/wealthy_men_of_reddit_what_about_being_rich_did/) post on r/AskMen,"Not me, but my parents.  My aunt once told me that she tries to keep people from seeing her home for as long as she can, even if they're doing service work for her.  She learned the hard way that if she had people come over to give an estimate, the estimate went up wildly as soon as people saw her home or realized she has an ""MD"" after her name. So now she goes to where they are, talks to them about what she needs done and gives all the relevant facts, and gets an estimate before they see her house.  She says it dropped the estimate significantly to do it that way. Also, ripple effect, but I never realized how expensive daily living was (groceries, gas, etc.) until I was living on my own.  My parents needed something?  They bought it.  They wanted to do a two week trip to Europe?  Planned it and went.   Ate where ever they wanted, did fun tours, etc. without caring about cost. The disconnect shows up between us.  I make $60k a year (without health insurance coverage or anything, so that comes right out of my pocket).  My aunt was adamant that I could save up and afford to take her and us to Italy for two weeks. Bullshit, madam, I'm barely saving up enough for a house after rent, bills, groceries, insurance, etc. have their way with my paycheck. Edit to add: My problem is not that I can't afford to go to Italy.  I can.  But my parents are expecting me to be able to rent a house for two weeks, pay for dinner, lunch, and breakfast there for two weeks for five people, and all our transportation.  And they do not want just ANY house for two weeks.  They expect I'll be able to afford one that is about $5000 for two weeks.",5819

What I've been doing is reminding myself of all of what I've been doing to push forward and above all not be hard on myself.

We had been eating out on a student budget, so we mainly had crepes and croissants in Paris since they’re cheap.

With my limited French, I ordered the salmon as I was craving a *warm* homecooked meal and figured this was the closest thing I would get. My (now husband, then boyfriend) ordered the steak.  Well...our plates came out...and mine was 100% cold and raw - think lox or nova but not salty with dill. He saw the disappointed look on my face and kept telling me over and over how he just LOVED salmon like that and how my plate looked SO good we just had to switch. I then proceeded to eat one of the best steaks of my life.  It was only on the next day at breakfast that he admitted he absolutely despised raw fish and that he kept cutting and pushing his food around to make it seem like he ate some of it. He just couldn’t get past my look of exasperation and sadness at not having a warm and hearty meal for the first time in weeks that he had to trade plates with me no matter what. He wouldn’t have even told me about his chivalrous move if I hadn’t kept pressing him on it at breakfast (he filled his plate with so much food since he was absolutely famished!).

I looked for huge ups and downs that made me feel madly in love and like I couldn’t live without that person while also living in fear that they might leave.

He didn’t play games and pursued me clearly and was very open that he wanted to be with me for the rest of his life. I would worry that I didn’t feel that “passion” and obsession with him. I didn’t feel heartbroken when we spent nights apart. I didn’t feel desperately and hopelessly in love. It took years of therapy (before my partner and during) to realize that my feelings of contentment and security and peace were actually good things.

g4tx65,"I noticed that on this website, a lot people seem to have this as the cut-off for when someone is supposed to have everything settled and figured out in their lives (personality-wise, career-wise, etc.). Or it seems to be the age which people say someone is finally “too old” for a lot of things (like dressing a certain way, or feeling unsure in life, which someone who is only a couple of years younger gets a free pass for). I’ve even seen people here say that once you’re 25, you’re not “young” anymore (this is also implied when I see posts targeted towards “older women”, 25 is always the cutoff age)? O_o Tbh it makes me feel kinda nervous (and old)...idk it seems arbitrary? I mean, is 25 generally considered “older”?","Spoiler alert: Not everybody follows the same timeline in life. You don't have to hit certain goals by a certain age. You can start uni at 40 and you're still valid, get married at 50 and you're still valid. So, the whole 25 is just an arbitrary thing. But if you own your own business by 23, good for you! You own your own business at 70? Good for you! Everybody lives at their own pace. Life is not a race!",1952

g8d3f2,Wanting to hear stories of how you met .,"Met my husband in my early 30s, way after the whole ""everyone is getting married"" phase of my life.  I had a nervous breakdown in my late 20s, which although triggered by a messy breakup, it really was about my messed up childhood.  Had survived that and a string of very bad relationships.  Had an ""aha"" moment during a weekend retreat that having a partner had no bearing on my worth as a person (while I intellectually knew this the whole time, this was the first time I really believed it.)  I truly believed that was ok if I never got married.  It was liberating, and changed my whole outlook on how I looked at dating and relationships with men in general (basically I did not look at every man as a prospect and learned to be more discerning about who I dated, i.e. not desperate.) I met my husband a month later at a charity event.  I thought he was a nice guy and that it would be cool to hang out.  From our first date I realized he was different (and he was because prior to my epiphany, I would not have dated him.)  It was just easy to be with him.   We got married 9 months later and have been together for 18+ years now. Ironically, exactly one week before we met, he had also come to the conclusion that life would still be good if he never got married.",1035

gbf0dw,And especially what has your experience with this been like as a college student?,"I struggled with this in college a lot, and it took a LOT of trial and error to make me a student (and person) who didn’t wait until the last minute for everything. I discovered that I’m very motivated by checklists. The act of being able to check off some sort of activity that I’ve done that day became almost like a reward system I guess. What I started to do was write down everything that I was trying to accomplish for the next day on a white board in my dorm at night. The trick is to include small tasks that you would do anyway or things that you enjoy. I would usually include making my bed or going to the campus gym for like 30 minutes. That sense of accomplishment that I felt after already being able to erase one task from my list after I had just woken up kept me motivated and focused for the day.  Then I found out that doing the typical college thing (staying up really late and doing work) was not working for me. Turns out I’m a morning person (who knew!) so I started getting up early and doing work.  TLDR: getting to know yourself and the things that motivate you is the first step to beating procrastination",1190

Edit 2: I didnt expect this much responses but thank you  Edit 3: To the people who have been asking/wondering what a Manic Pixie Dream Girl is: basically just means a quirky, spontaneous, eccentric girl whose sole purpose is to bring the typically recluse, depressed or broken man out of their comfort zones and live life or whatever. In real life, the MPDG may manifest differently and those experiences are what I'm looking for. Edit 4: Most probably not going to reply anymore, but I took so much from all of the responses. A lot of women accept the role (though I acknowledge some of the tropes aren't necessarily performative/fake) often as coping mechanisms on trauma agaisnt men and patriarchal femininity (a generalization of course). It's depressing because growing up under the male gaze as a young woman while coming in terms with ourselves is perpetually exhausting, feeding a need to constantly perform becomes a norm for us. I honestly just wanted to hear out on women's  stories in real life, and it truly never occurred to me just how many women could relate to this. Of course, I take into account that there are so many social/cultural factors that come in place which cannot be ignored and hard to undo.

I had to learn that I can assert my own needs and I deserve to get what I want and need out of a relationship. By standing up to boyfriends, I quickly learned who is worth it and who isn’t. I spoke up to an ex about how hurt I was when he cancelled our weekend plans to play video games with coworkers, and he told me how needy and unattractive my behavior was. So I left him. I told my current boyfriend that it wasn’t right to tell me he’d call me after work and then not follow through.

While some subreddits have gone dark for 24 hours, and some are going dark for 9 minutes, we wanted to find a line that allowed us to allow space for our community to discuss this matter, but also time to reflect on the loss of life and injustice. With that said, we recognize that we are a unique community on Reddit, and we want to give space for the women (and anyone else) of this community to discuss this topic which is why we opted out of a 24 out blackout.

After a prolonged conversation with the mod team (involving multiple moderators who are black) the choice came down to two hours because it was felt that 9 minutes would not impact/affect enough users to give proper pause to the loss of life and injustice, but at the same time it felt like a disservice to our community to shut down for such a prolonged period of time, given how hostile Reddit is to many members of our community, especially at moments like this.",https://www.gofundme.com/f/9v4q2-justice-for-breonna-taylor Justice for Breonna.

I would also like to know more examples on the character trope/stereotypes found in tv shows and movies not just books.","I read a lot of romance and that is the place to go for women writing men! Most are brooding and a bit standoffish but they warm up to the main female character/love interest. They have toned bodies and are every handsome - lots of chiseled jaws. They're strong and intellegent. They have a high libido and will bring the love interest to orgasm at least half a dozen times in one go. They love to give oral sex but don't really want to receive it because it's ""too much"" and they'll make the woman stop in about 2 seconds before they ""lose control"" so they can have sex. He's also able to have sex in multiple positions and a dozen times in one night. He also usually has a dog or two. Sometimes he will be good with children, if children are present in the book. He also usually has a tragic backstory that makes him believe he is undeserving of love.  For an example just go to the historical romance section of your local bookstore and pick up the nearest book with a shirtless man on it.  Granted, that's very specific to historical romance.

It was a miracle we were okay, but luckily we weren't hurt, just in shock and sore from being thrown forward. I remember as the other car hit us, that dream state broke and everything felt super real all of a sudden.  My boss saw the accident and came down to check on us and call 911 and everything. After the paramedics cleared us my mom told him I knew something was going to happen to me, and he got super serious and said hey, if you EVER feel that way again, or have any intuition or anxiety, stop and call me and tell me you're not coming to work because you had another bad feeling.

It can feel like connection to a point, but try to be aware whether it's helping you or just feeding the negative feelings.

knruu6,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,"When I was 22 and fresh out of college, my parents decided to take me off the family cell phone plan.  I'd moved out to the dorm at 17 and had paid my own way on all my bills since. The only bill that I didn't have full responsibility for was my cell phone. It was 2008 and I'd just graduated, and I was struggling to find work to support myself. My rent -- with a roommate -- was $355/month and my main job paid $400/month, so I was supplementing my income with various gigs, selling any personal possessions I didn't need, etc just to afford utilities, and my grocery budget was only $15/week so I often only ate one meal a day.  My parents were in poverty too, so they couldn't afford to help pay my bills or anything like that, and they were struggling in their own way. In order to save money, they decided because I was an adult they'd kick me off the family phone plan. I broke down when my mom told me. I begged her not to. Doing it would save them a whopping $20/month, and it would force me to spend an extra $55-75/month that I didn't have. Of course I offered to pay them my portion of the bill - just keep me on the family plan! I'll give you my share of it every month! But because I was *an adult* they dumped me anyway. My mom likes to brag to her friends about how resourceful I was during that time period, how I hustled and pushed in order to survive. Every time I hear her talking about it, I want to break down, even 10+ years later, because all I remember is being miserable, terrified, and hungry. She also doesn't know that part of how I ""hustled"" to survive at that time was by getting into sex work for a few months, and a big part of why I had to start doing that was because of that sudden extra monthly bill I couldn't afford to pay.",2803

Especially in romantic relationships I have trouble trusting in my partner's love & affection. I quickly feel excluded in social situations, and I can be pretty emotional.",864

I might not get around to replying to everyone but know that I've read all your responses and really appreciate them <3","If I stay in bed later than 10am I start getting antsy and feeling like I'm wasting the day. There's always stuff to do - exercising, playing with the dogs, cleaning up the house, doing some cooking, going for a walk, catching up with friends, reading a book, enjoying your hobbies, etc. I always feel way more productive and happy when I'm sticking with a loose daily routine.",1667
m76giq,"So often I hear that people don’t know how to talk to their circles about harmful behavior because “none of my friends act that way”. Yet some of my most “woke” friends have done hurtful, alienating things towards my family without realizing it. I want to hear your stories.","Honestly, the worst thing to deal with is dating. I'm mixed race: half asian and half white. The creepy shit you have to deal with is definitely amplified. I hate being called exotic: I've never left America in my life. I'm as domestically grown as you can get. I once had a white dude try and defend that with ""but it's a compliment!"" No. Then there's the unexpected shit you get in relationships that sting so bad. Finding out the dude you've been seeing for a month studied abroad in Asia, wants an Asian/anime tattoo despite not being Asian, connecting dots and realizing they only date Asian women. Do you like me for me or for my race? Then there's the other side, where Asian men can get seriously aggressive about the race of your partner. Seriously, I had a stranger come onto me, I made up a boyfriend to be left alone, and he immediately started guessing about his race and being unpleasant/aggressive. My first college boyfriend was from a smaller town. When we got serious he excitedly told me that this was his first interracial relationship, and he'd never understood why his friends thought Asian women were so hot, but that now he got it, and he liked that I was small. We had a rough breakup and he immediately jumped back on Tinder that night. He called me to tell me he was now talking to another Asian girl and how his friends all thought we looked alike (in the nicest way, we very much DID NOT). The thought that I had gone to exotic and new to his new fetish standard disgusts me to this day. He knows my reddit too, so if you're reading this, James, yes, that was racist and really unpleasant.     Edit: I'm getting a lot of comments about what race I date/ if I only date white men and never Asian men. I worded it weird. I've dated Asian men and mixed men, too. I edited my post for clarity. My main point was when you're Asian or mixed race, your partner is seen as you choosing one race and betraying others, rather than finding a partner. Furthermore, the question regarding fetishization versus preference is coming up too much. It's fetishization because you're expected to act a certain way, and it's clear they're not dating you because you're special or different. They're dating you because they expect you to be the same. I don't endorse anyone dating only one race. There are billions of people who can't all be discounted on the basis of race. Please use Google. Edit 2: I'm tired of getting weird messages about the racial preferences and objectification. I don't care that you're only attracted to Asian women. First of all, this reduces Asian women down only to your sexual gratification. Also, Asian women range from billions of women who are Middle Eastern, Nepalese, Indian to Russian women. The Asian sexualized woman is visualized as a small, light skinned, objectified, obedient woman, which does not truly represent Asian women. Again, use Google. I will not be responding.",3964
mdu9gw,edit: I definitely did not expect all this attention! Thank you all for the rewards! <3,"Respecting the vagina's self- cleaning techniques perfected by billions of years of evolution and trusting this process to work, not trying to put in any of the toxic ""cleansing"" products peddled to girls and women by multi-billion dollar companies that have our interests last in line. A regular gentle cleans on the vulva is all that's needed. Regular discharge is good and it shows the cleaning system is working. Every girl and women at her baseline has a regular normal smell that doesn't smell like roses or peaches that she knows about and this is not something to want to get rid of.",6080

It cracks me up because he repeats anything that catches his interest and then asks if he said it right and if it means what he thinks it means.

I'll remember and carry them all with me as we all try to work through this novel time in our lives <3","This happened to me in college due to (at the time, untreated) bipolar disorder. I still performed pretty well considering, but it definitely set me back academically. It closed some doors to me forever and will affect my grad school prospects if I decide to get a Master’s.  I just try to take a larger view of things. Everyone gets their lottery draw of advantages and disadvantages. This was mine. There will always be people who face far more challenges than me, and people who are blessed with massive advantages over me. I think I have to be grateful for the blessings I do have and understand that most people’s life paths are not linear. We’re all moving through peaks and valleys all the time.",2606

mr9d1r,I swear I always see the majority of the women with long hair with their hair beautifully waving in the wild whereas I’m over here looking like a 1700s colonial man with my low ponytail. Do other ladies just try way more than me?,"It’s funny I am in the same boat as you! I have decided it’s a ‘sensory thing’ I can’t handle my hair in my face, flapping around, obscuring my vision etc it’s an ‘effort’ to put up with it... so it gets tied up A LOT.  My daughter has long hair it will be in her eyes, in her mouth, caught up under her arms, stuck in her sunscreen etc and she just LOVES it and herself sick with it out.",1999
mur7c1,My 18 year old brother just passed away and I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced something similar and came out the other side. Does the grief ever stop being so overwhelming?

n04flv,"And to those of you who did not, and are still here, you are a strong survivor.","I called the police and they came and I had to tell them exactly what happened. Then they had me drive behind them to the local justice center where I had to sit down and tell them every second leading up to what happened and the entire thing, took almost 2 hours and they asked me extensive and painful questions. More questions than I could imagine. Then they took me into a doctor office type of room and inspected my entire body, including opening up my vagina and painfully swabbing all over. It was almost as traumatizing as the initial incident. Love to all of you",2059

n94800,"As an example, this joke: First child eats cat food, mother calls the ambulance. Second child eats cat food, mother takes it from the child and gives back to the cat. Third child eats cat food, mother sais ""This is cat's problem""",A lot of things tbh.  I was much more relaxed with the second mainly because I had way more experience. But starting solids was probably the one I will say. We did baby-led weaning with the second.  The first one was on this super strict schedule of purées and the second was just whelp here is some really soft food. I was too tired fighting with the first kid over what he’d eat to deal with the same rigorous feeding schedule.  First one was super picky the second ate whatever you put in front of him.,1413
naqgk9,Just want to put a reminder out there- it’s important and only takes 1 minute of your time. Stay well ladies!,"Men — you should feel for lumps also. breast cancer is rare in men, but it still happens, so take a minute to just feel around and make sure everything is fine.  As a cancer survivor, I recommend men to check their nuts also for any lumps and everyone to check their neck lymph nodes for any painless enlargement that persists. Could save your life!",1089
njiqds,So glad a lot of you guys have inspiring and healthy stories to share! Love reading them 🤩,I think for me it was more that I didn’t understand how simple it reallly is. When I heard eat less move more my head translated it to starve yourself and over exercise. The culture around weight loss is just extreme after extreme. I track my calories now and just eat 500 less than i’d need to maintain my weight and do 30 minutes of some form of exercise most days. That’s worked better than anything else i’ve ever tried and i’m sticking to it because there’s no extremes.,2851

While abuse is never okay, your stories have helped me understand how hurt causes more hurt, until you say 'stop'. I wish you healing and peace. <3","We were teenagers. He cheated on me, tried to lie about it before being caught, then begged me to forgive him and wanted to get back together. I accepted and thought I could move past what happened, but I couldn’t.  Over the next few months, I just wanted him to hurt the way he made me hurt. I was extremely verbally and emotionally abusive to him and routinely broke him down to tears out of the spite I was feeling. I finally broke it off because I didn’t like the person I was being.  I actually reached out to apologize to him years later. Yeah, he treated me badly too, but that didn’t make it ok for me to abuse him.",2858

How easy it is to resolve issues when you can actually voice your feelings and opinions without starting a fight.
