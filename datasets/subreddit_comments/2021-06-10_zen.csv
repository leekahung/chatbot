The rules: Grab the closest book to you, turn to page 54, post the 5th sentence as your status. Don't mention the title. Copy the rules as part of your status. The closest book to myself was Zen Mind, Beginner Mind. I opened to page 54 out of curiosity to see what wisdom I might find only to find a blank page.  I found that to be pretty interesting and thought you all might as well. ",The one with the fly on it?  ;)  ,9
11x5rl,"A Zen Master lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut at the foot of a mountain. One evening, while he was away, a thief sneaked into the hut only to find there was nothing in it to steal. The Zen Master returned and found him. ""You have come a long way to visit me,"" he told the prowler, ""and you should not return empty handed. Please take my clothes as a gift."" The thief was bewildered, but he took the clothes and ran away. The Master sat naked, watching the moon. ""Poor fellow,"" he mused, "" I wish I could give him this beautiful moon."" There are many things I can take away from this amazing story. It never gets old and it is always refreshing. What do you guys take away from it?

13qfoe,"I thought it was a nice, quiet place, where people thought about things and didn't post frequently. Now, we have a user who not only makes the most threads, he also posts in all threads. This isn't /r/zen anymore. It's /r/ewkzen. It's his version of it, and you're all upvoting him. I don't understand. He is too excited, talking too much, listening too little. I think you are doing him an extreme disservice to exalt him so. Nothing good will come of it, for him, or for you. Kill the Buddah. Kill the ewk. Kill the subreddit. I wish you well :)",Zen can be very hard to comprehend.   I don't care whether or not Ewk gets it.  I don't care whether or not he is annoying.  I find him neither interesting or annoying.

140pr6,"I'm new to this community and somewhat of a lurker, but I enjoy reading your discussions and occasional heated exchanges. I found this quote on another subreddit community (link posted below) and liked it because its complexity. I hope you enjoy. [Link](http://redd.it/1407ji)","The idea that there are sides is not Zen.  These old Masters did not see themselves as any different, no better, no worse, no wiser, no more foolish. In koans it might seems as if they rebuke or whack or twist or teach but it is all the same - they point without regard to who looks or who follows.  How could anyone be against them?  They stood for nothing.  How could anyone insult them?  With no attachments it was like insulting a spring breeze. ",3
14wq2p,"Q: What is the Way and how must it be followed? A: What sort of *thing* do you suppose the Way to be, that you should wish to follow it? Q: What instructions have the Masters everywhere given for dhyana-practice and the study of the Dharma? A: Words used to attract the dull of wit are not to be trusted. Q: If those teachings were meant for the dull-witted, I have yet to hear what Dharma has been taught to those of really high capacity. A: If they are really men of high capacity, where could they find people to follow?  If they seek from within themselves, they will find nothing tangible; how much less can they find a Dharma worthy of their attention elsewhere!  Do not look to what is called the Dharma by preachers, for what sort of Dharma could that be? Q: If that is so, should we not seek for anything at all? A: By conceding this, you would save yourself a lot of mental effort. Q: But in this way everything would be eliminated.  There cannot be just nothing. A: Who called it nothing?  Who was this fellow?  But you wanted to *seek* for something. Q: Since there is no need to seek, why do you also say that not everything is eliminated? A: Not to seek is to rest tranquil.  Who told you to eliminate anything?  Look at the void in front of your eyes.  How can you produce it or eliminate it? Q: If I could reach this Dharma, would it be like the void? A: Morning and night I have explained to you that the Void is both One and Manifold.  I said this as a temporary expedient, but you are building up concepts from it. Q: Do you mean that we should not form concepts as human beings normally do? A: I have not prevented you; but concepts are related to the senses; and, when feeling takes place, wisdom is shut out. Q: Then should we avoid any feeling in relation to the Dharma? A: Where no feeling arises, who can say that you are right? Q: Why do you speak as though I was mistaken in all the questions I have asked Your Reverence? A: You are a man who doesn't understand what is said to him.  What is all this about being mistaken?","Q: How, then, does a man accomplish this comprehension of his own Mind?  A: That which asked the question IS your own Mind *but if you were to remain quiescent and to refrain from the smallest mental activity, its substance would be seen as a void -- you would find it formless, occupying no point in space and falling neither into the category of existence nor into that of non-existence.* Because it is imperceptible Bodhidharma said: 'Mind, which is our real nature, is the unbegotten and indestructible Womb; in response to circumstances, it transforms itself into phenomena.' For the sake of convenience, we speak of Mind as the intelligence (prajna); but when it does not respond to circumstances [and so rests from creating objects.] it cannot be spoken of in such dualistic terms as existence or non-existence. Besides, even when engaged in creating objects in response to causality, it is still imperceptible. If you know this and rest tranquilly in nothingness then you are indeed following the Way of the Buddhas. Therefore does the sutra say: 'Develop a mind which rests on no thing whatever.' - HUANG-PO (translated by John Blofeld)",11

I only understood it to mean that the zen simplicity was knowing that after eating comes washing the bowl and by doing that you could stay in the moment.

1fla27,"Several months ago someone was questioning me, accusing me of doing market research for a book.  Even as I was laughing at the idea of writing a ""not Zen"" book I got to work.  It turns out I didn't have much to say.  It is only slightly longer than this post. The thing about not Zen, other than that it is ""not Zen"", is that it doesn't amount to anything.  The old men said it, but what can you build with it?  ""Not Zen"" is only interesting when people insist that they know what Zen is, if they have faith in a idea or a practice and claim that sort of thing is what is Zen.  Of course the people who insist that they know what Zen is aren't going to read a book called ""not Zen"".  Ha!  Now that's market research.

1gwdz6,"Zen literature is filled with instances of a word or phrase causing accidental enlightenment, great understanding, what-have-you. This could possibly be a life changing experience, and some idiot hawking fruit on the street, when you ask for the best one could say ""they're all the best"", then your precious ego that you've spent your entire life cultivating could be crushed in a flash. The only reasonable thing to do is to protect yourself from this calamity, so I've constructed this formula so that you may shield yourself against accidental enlightenment, which left Joshu ruined and homeless. Make strong judgments very quickly, being sure to always make sharp discriminations between things. Also, don't pay too much attention to uninterpreted reality; don't look at the beauty of nature in silence, or allow some gap in your stream of thought. Something might slip through the cracks uninterpreted, alerting you to the fact that what you perceive as reality is a web of judgment, discrimination, and conceptual thought, and that something else exists beneath it. So, being busy *could* help, but even still, if you're paying too much attention, that could be a problem. It's best to stay busy without really fully absorbing or paying too much attention to anything. React as quickly as possible things, and try not to see them as they are; make sure you consider how they relate to you, and whether they're good or bad for you. Don't try to grasp the reality of the thing, that could very easily accidentally enlighten you. It's essential that you *think* something about it, and have some feeling toward it, as quickly as possible, shielding you from any contact with uninterpreted reality. Hopefully, if you don't like the idea of enlightenment, these simple guidelines will help stop an otherwise innocuous word or phrase from causing it!","Thanks.

1j36su,"I was thinking about this today as I was trying to find a moral in the Zen tradition. There is nothing that can be said about it. It is neither moral nor not morall because it can't talked about in either/or terms. There is no definite positions in Zen itself to warrent anything because it isn't anything in the first place. It isn't even Buddhist! There is no way to intellegably talk about something which can't be talked about. However, to gain insight to this I suppose it is important to have /r/zen or some community to lead to the unspeakable. So we can walk away saying there is no such thing as Zen.

1jumpc,Has anyone here had any experience on living in a Zen temple for an extended period of time ? I've had a hard time finding any monastery/temples that advertise anything past 7 day seshin's. Thanks!,"First, where are you? Second, why do you want to go spend some time doing monastic practice? Third, why Zen particularly, and not Theravada or Vajrayana? I bounced around a lot before I found I found a place and a teacher where I felt my practice could grow, and figuring out what you're after is important. Monasteries are not easy places to be. In fact, most of the worst days of my entire life happened inside the walls of one. They can be absolutely miserable to be in, and you may often find yourself questioning why you did it in the first place, and doubting your ability to continue on. The shitty thing is, it doesn't get any easier either. The first year is great - your body becomes more settled into zazen, your mind gradually calms down. The head monk can kind of be an asshole, but whatever, you're letting go of things like that.  The second year, you feel comfortable sitting for long periods - maybe you're in full-lotus now for most of the sesshins. Rohatsu is still tough (nobody ever gets used to those things) but you can sit for four or five hours at a stretch without any serious complaints from your knees or back. Maybe you're working on koans now, but hopefully not because if you are, your teacher is probably rushing you. Sanzen or dokusan is encouraging, you feel energized when you leave and really focused on your practice. The head monk has started to maybe respect you a tiny bit, maybe he thinks you have some potential to be a good student of Zen. You get hit a little less with the keisaku. Year three though, year three is a bitch. You've got some responsibility to the place - so on top of all of the day-to-day things you had to do, now you have a job in the monastery. Now roshi expects more, more than you think you can do. Sanzen is terrible. You go in, get yelled at and hit with a stick, give him any answer for your koan and nothing is good enough. You leave defeated, wondering if Zen is even for you, or if there's any point to this stupid medieval Japanese way of doing things. Day after day after day. Sesshin get harder to sit through. Your knees start to ache a little bit, and there's a pain in your back that is always present. Now you're carrying the stick during zazen, and there might be a bit of anger and aggression when you use it to encourage your fellow sitters. A little bit of superiority directed toward the new guys. Rohatsu this year though, it's terrible but you power through it like a machine. Your fourth year, usually things die down a little. The practice settles into you and you feel adjusted, finally, to the rigors of sleeping three to four hours a night. It keeps your mind honed. Too much sleep makes you lazy in your zazen. The gaps close a little, and the mindfulness practice shows up in life off of the cushion in ways you never expect. The monastery gets harder - roshi is always pushing, and the head monk now sees you are a man of Zen and is worse than ever before. You get welts on your back from the stick, frostbite on your ears from sitting in the cold. You find ways to make it even harder. Sleeping on a cushion? Fuck that, you're on the tatami mat, or even the hard floor of the zendo. I mean, you have to set the example now for the new guys. Show them this place is serious.  Year five is where you realize whether you're in it for real or not. The fifth year is the most important for any beginner. Your body has adapted to sitting in silly positions for long hours. Your mind is focused, sharp, always present and unmoved by anything internal or external. By the fifth year, you have developed a solid foundation in Zen that will never leave you, even if you stop sitting entirely. Five years of monthly sesshin, five rohatsu, 10,000 hours of sitting. It's part of your bones now. Now, though, now is where it gets tricky: the zendo becomes your home. You're comfortable with the form of Zen - chanting, eating out of stupid little bowls, wearing crazy clothes, shaving your head every five days. This is your fucking life. How do you get back to the first day? When none of this was easy, and through the very easiness of it, was difficult - because now you can't judge whether you've come further in your practice or not. Roshi seems happy, but maybe it's just because you haven't given up yet. Maybe he's just saying things to make you feel better so you don't leave like so many of his other students have. You start questioning everything that made you get into this shit in the first place. You are completely full of doubt, but you're not even sure who's doing the doubting in the first place any more. Call it an existential crisis. You perceive all as being empty, so you're still stuck in these stupid compare and contrast ways of seeing things. You see form as being empty, but you don't see emptiness as being form. You hit a fucking wall. Some people stick it out. But I have no idea what year six is like. Also, expect to dig a lot of holes, move a lot of rocks, and chop a lot of wood.",1875

1m08y0,"I spent the morning in a half-day zazen retreat, with several hours of practice. But, I had not slept well last night, and it was difficult to focus. All morning, I felt like I was wasting my time. I left feeling frustrated, discouraged.  On my walk home, I turned onto my street and found my neighbor from across the hall, kneeling beside her car, picking up bits of glass. Someone had smashed her window during the night. Without hesitation I approached her and began to help her pick up glass. It was a beautiful day, blue and sunny with a light breeze. I sat by the side of the road with my neighbor for at least 30-40 minutes, talking about life, counting our blessings as we picked up glass, enjoying the nice weather.  ""At least it's not raining,"" she said. She was so appreciative that I had appeared and lingered. ""I knew when I saw you coming that you were going to help. You have this confident, gentle way about you."" I began to realize, as I gave my time freely to her without any indication that I had anywhere else to be, that, perhaps, this was it. And by this, I mean *this,* and by it, I mean *it.* And with that, I forgot all about my earlier frustrations.  ","I don't know if it's the ""it"" to end all ""its,"" but meditative ease has put me in similar situations. After a sesshin in May, I arrived at the bustling platform of the central train station, and suddenly a little dog ran out from an overloaded woman's dog crate, scared and barking and running around, and it was just completely obvious to help her out. Of course this is just the normal thing to do, except often I'm kind of too timid or stressed or confused to stop and take care of things -- and it seems like a lot of other people are as well -- but when the mind is calm and alert, things just work better.",24

The 4 Statements? > A special transmission outside the scriptures;   No dependence upon words and letters;   Direct pointing at the mind of man,   seeing into one's own nature.""  Alrite, Imma try to explain this in layman's terms. Note that, ultimately, the first Statement takes precedence, and what I'm going to explain is NOT Zen. However I hope it explains *why* it's not Zen. Zen doesn't come to you, you come to Zen. That is, *you* decided to study/practice Zen. Why? What for? What are you running away from, or towards? You know that; Zen doesn't know that. What are your problems? What are you like? Zen doesn't know that. What should you do? Zen doesn't know that. Only you can know that. What's that? You don't know? Then find out! See into your true nature! What's that? You don't know how? That's okay, we have the Old Men and Zen masters. But they can't tell you what to do, remember? They can only point at the mind. But don't think that's what important. They're only pointers. What's important is seeing your true nature! Therefore, don't depend on words and letters. And because words and letters are not dependable, Zen is transmitted outside the scriptures. In fact, one can question whether there's anything being transmitted at all. If everybody finds their own ""Zen"" themselves, what is being transmitted? TL;DR nobody's gonna help you figure out your own shit, me neither. Figure it out yourself. If you need guidance, Buddhism is next door :) (In fact, certain persons in this sub lovingly call those who give ""too much"" guidance as ""Buddhists"" and ""not Zen"" and it really irks other people who are more interested in theoretical study than figuring out their own shit.)

Zen is ordinary; it's simple growth. Folks here kindle fires where a bit of water would suffice. Each time you stretch a metaphor or over-analyze, you are starting over.   The texts are 'what you see is what you get'. Any self discoveries uncovered by reading texts are inevitably specific and to be disregarded.

22m88p,"An Interview with Gia-fu Feng Q: You've mentioned Alan Watts several times and I know that you've been with him when he was teaching. What was he like to be with? A: You see Alan Watts was very creative. When he drinks he's very clever. He was in a class, you know, at night time, he was all drunk. But his lectures were never boring. He was a tremendous entertainer. He said, ""I'm an entertainer, I'm no Buddhist philosopher."" Q: Alan Watts actually died from alcohol, didn't he? A: Oh yeah. At that time he drank whisky by the bottle.  Q: But how could that tie in with the Tao?  A: That's from the Tao! The fact that he drank is totally in tune with the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove-his utter disregard for convention. One of the sages, a famous poet called Liu Ling, had a servant who followed him carrying a jug of wine and a spade. In this way he always had some wine to drink and his servant would be ready to bury him if he dropped dead during a drinking bout! It's in the Tao. So Alan Watts' drinking is quite Taoistic.",Oh I'm going to get so Taoist this Friday...,39

244v0h,"The most strongly enforced of all known taboos is the taboo against knowing who or what you really are behind the mask of your apparently separate, independent, and isolated ego. I am not thinking of Freud's barbarous Id or Unconscious as the actual reality behind the façade of personality. Freud, as we shall see, was under the influence of a nineteenth-century fashion called ""reductionism,"" a curious need to put down human culture and intelligence by calling it a fluky by-product of blind and irrational forces. They worked very hard, then, to prove that grapes can grow on thornbushes. As is so often the way, what we have suppressed and overlooked is something startlingly obvious. The difficulty is that it is so obvious and basic that one can hardly find the words for it. The Germans call it a Hintergedanke, an apprehension lying tacitly in the back of our minds which we cannot easily admit, even to ourselves. The sensation of ""I"" as a lonely and isolated center of being is so powerful and commonsensical, and so fundamental to our modes of speech and thought, to our laws and social institutions, that we cannot experience selfhood except as something superficial in the scheme of the universe. I seem to be a brief light that flashes but once in all the aeons of time—a rare, complicated, and all-too-delicate organism on the fringe of biological evolution, where the wave of life bursts into individual, sparkling, and multicolored drops that gleam for a moment only to vanish forever. Under such conditioning it seems impossible and even absurd to realize that myself does not reside in the drop alone, but in the whole surge of energy which ranges from the galaxies to the nuclear fields in my body. At this level of existence ""I"" am immeasurably old; my forms are infinite and their comings and goings are simply the pulses or vibrations of a single and eternal flow of energy. ~ Alan Watts","In the knowledge of the Atman, which is the dark night to the ignorant,  the recollected mind is fully awake and aware.

254ktn,"I'll make this quick. I've been here a little while and am familiar with most of the regulars. There are a lot of complaints about the degradation of this sub at the hands of a small but vocal few. Many others seem to feel the answer to this is to be more vocal, to raise more hell, to stir up more argument. It seems readily apparent that this serves only to further degrade the quality of posts here.  So can we take a different approach- neither grasp at nor push away the discord that crops up every now and then? Just let it do it's own thing. It's of course just human discord, nothing needs to be added. Let's just talk to each other about Zen- that's what this sub is here for. How's your practice going?

2cptor,"Neat little story to share. Last night on my way out of Dubuque, Iowa, I picked up a couple of hitchhikers. Two young guys from France, early 20's. Their names were Louis and Atienne. They had both just finished college, saved up some money, and decided to travel the world for a while before settling down into their jobs. They were travelling across the US, started in New York and were making their way to San Francisco via hitchhiking and buses. I told them I'd take them as far west as Dyersville. They were fine with that and wanted to see a smaller town. We drove and talked all about their travels, the US, France, languages, cultures, lots of stuff. Lots to talk about.They wanted to get some beer so we stopped at a gas station along the way. We got to Dyersville and they told me they were looking for a place to camp for cheap or free. They said they had enough money to get around, but were trying to keep it as inexpensive as possible. I took them to New Wine park and showed them how to register. They asked if I'd stay for a beer, so we sat at the picnic table and had a beer and continued talking. (I thought it was pretty funny, as I was driving through dark tunnel of trees on the way to the park, they started looking at each other and laughing nervously, like I was some crazy guy taking them far off into the woods....must have been a little unsettling for them!) Since they wanted to travel Hwy 20 west, and New Wine is several miles off the beaten path, I told them if they would be ready to go at 5:45 the next morning I'd pick them up and take them back to Dyersville so they could be on their way. So this morning, I arrived at 5:45 and they were all packed up and ready to go. I took them back to Dyersville and dropped them off at McDonald's. We bid each other farewell and I made my way to work. What does this have to do with Zen? I dunno. My first reaction upon seeing these two on the side of the road was barely to even register their existence. Then I got a wild hair up my ass, decided to seize the moment. They asked me ""why did you choose to pick us up?"" I said ""I could imagine some day I might find myself in a similar situation, and I hope when that day comes, there's someone that will pick me up."" The entire exchange, the whole evening and next morning felt like the stories I read of encounters between travelers from long ago. It had that same sort of flavor. Each word carries a weight. Conversation unlike you tend to have in your ordinary, everyday life. Maybe I could pay attention to that sort of thing more often.",I'd say that's pretty zen,21

2x4u65,"**Preamble**  I see a lot of shit going on here, and very little that has to do with what (I assume) we're all here for; attaining the understanding of Zen. Now i'm not going to mince words with anyone, you can call it enlightenment, non-attainment, non-enlightenment, whatever you want. Here are a few practical ways to realize Zen, there are several, but understanding one is usually enough to understand them all. I will be paraphrasing from Yoka, Dogen, Kyozan and others.   **Step 1 - Enter Zen from here.**  Zen indicates that this moment enough - nothing more is needed. Nothing is missing, nothing needs to be added, this very moment, these sounds, this place, is enough. This very mind IS the Buddha mind. *So why am I not enlightened yet?* you ask. **Step 1.1 - Desire**  The reason is that the root of the mind is desire, if you cut the root, the mind falls. The only reason you are not enlightened right now is because you desire things that will make your life better. How do you get rid of desire? First of all - don't try, that is going to make everything worse. You get rid of desire simply by seeing how desire arises in you, how it affects you and make you discontent and unhappy with where you are, in seeing this, you have the opportunity to let go. Without desire, there is nowhere to go, and then you are home.  **Step 2 - Faith.**  This one is obviously dedicated to you-know-who. Since Zen is the love child of Taoism and Buddhism, this post would not be complete without mentioning Trust. Faith, which is to say, absolute trust, is another gate through which you are able to be in the moment; it means to surrender completely to existence, with all your worries, all your desires, all your fears, emptied into the hands of existence. When you do this, you become empty, and then you attain the non-attainment. Now remember - this is not belief, this is not ""I believe existence will help me and give me what I want."" No, that is not it, it is absolute trust: faith. Leap before you look. Surrender your mind to existence and you will be empty. **Step 3 - Meditation.**  This one is fairly simple. Since the core of Zen is that you are already that which you are seeking, all you really need to do is just have a long enough moment of no thoughts distracting you while you are also conscious - to see that everything is quite in order already and you need not be seeking anything. Meditation is simply sitting silently and doing nothing until you become so empty that this happens.  **Closing**   There are of course many other ways to attain Zen, including those that are not mentioned in Zen, because all enlightenment is the same enlightenment, whether it be Buddhist, Sufist, Hasidic, Tantric, Yogic, Vedic and so on.  But let us remember that there is nothing complicated or difficult about Zen, and that the exchanges of Zen-masters are only understood by a very silent mind, a very empty person - they are not literature to analyze like we learn in academics. They do not have an answer that will enlighten you. Your enlightenment IS the answer.   Zen is the no-nonsense approach and there is nothing complicated about it, you just have to take the time it takes to existentially (not intellectually) understand what Zen is trying to tell you.  ",Well it's about time somebody on this forum rise above the bullshit and transmit an understanding of zen through words. I don't think anybody here had thought of that.,24
2ze7oj,"I'm partial to this subreddit because /r/meditation mostly attracts people with very shallow interest in meditation and /r/Buddhism is in a catatonic state of precepts and sutras and I don't know what. /r/Zen is the best of both worlds because Zen largely dispenses with the formalities and gets straight to the point. But let's be honest here. None of us are enlightened, none of us really truly get Zen. Why don't we stop acting like we know, like we're cool, dogma dueling each other, one-upping each other, arguing, fighting, wasting our breaths? I'll admit I got pulled into it as well and added my fair share of shit to the shitty culture on this subreddit. But it's hard not to, which is why more than just one person has to change if the spirit of this place has to change.  This could be the place where we go to ask questions, try to understand things, come together and use our intelligence, discuss our practices (or lack thereof) share our experiences, and try to find out what the hell Zen is and more importantly how we take that understanding into our lives on more than just an intellectual level. Why don't we start over, stop pretending to be cool, and try to figure this out together? I sure as hell don't know what Zen is. I have no idea what Mumon or Huang-Po is talking about. I understand all the theory and I've read plenty of books, but I don't understand Zen at all.  If someone, anyone, is interested in starting over and regarding each other as earnest, sincere seekers, in an environment of non-competition where we can try and ferret out this elusive understanding of reality that is Zen, that would really make me happy.  Life is difficult enough as it is, why are we wasting energy fighting each other? We certainly need each other's help to try to decipher Zen, to talk about practices and non-practices, understandings and share insights. This should be a place of salient debate, earnest questioning, and laughing at ewk.  Do I hear the sounds of one-hands clapping?

4ueuov,""" you should just listen to him,  just observe what his way is.  We put very little emphasis on right and wrong or good and bad.  We just see things as they are with him,  and accept them.   Usually,  when you listen to some statement,  you hear it as a kind of echo of yourself.  You are actually listening to your own opinion. If it agrees with your opinion you may accept it,  but if it does not,  you will reject it or you may not even really hear it.  That is one danger when  you listen to someone.  The other danger is to be caught by the statement.  If you do not understand your master's statement in its true sense,  you will easily be caught by something which is involved in your subjective opinion,  or by some particular way the statement is expressed.  You will take what he says only as a statement, without understanding the spirit behind the words.  This kind of danger is always there. "" -Shunryu Suzuki",What about my objective opinions tho ,3

7ffpc0,"Every time anyone posts any sort of actual teaching, he gets hit with a bunch of hostile nihilistic sneers by various self-repeating users who claim everything is ""Not Zen"", and shoot down any positive content like it's their life mission. Here's a [random example](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/7fc869/some_things_hongren_said/dqbcwkp/) I came across a few minutes ago upon logging in. This nonsense gets posted here daily, profusely. It's exhausting to fight it because it's so pervasive and lazy: all the nihilists have to do is respond with a random empty catchphrase like ""Not Zen"", or ""Sounds made up"", or some nonsensical utterance. Then they can fancy themselves Zen Masters, because hey, they're replying just like Hunag-bo in that one koan they bothered reading once. For the few diligent practitioners in this forum, let's remember that short koans about Emptiness are *not* the only form of Zen literature. In fact, some of the most important sources impart plenty of positive teachings. Let's refute this one random comment by citing perhaps the most important Zen text of the very Lineage recognized and supposedly followed in this forum: The Sixth Chan Patriarch's Platform Sutra. I could likewise refute any of the nihilistic claims made here so often, if only I was obsessive enough to respond to 30-40 r/Zen comments per day. u/rockytimber claims: > Repping [sutras] is not zen. Zen does not rep anything. Reps are models, dude. Why fill your single little house with trash, weeds and dirt? Here's Hui-neng, the Sixth Chan Patriarch, repping the Diamond Sutra like a fiend: > I walked toward the door and met a customer reciting the Diamond Sutra out loud. As soon as I heard the words, my mind felt clear and awake -- Platform Sutra, Red Pine translation, section 2 > At the beginning of the third watch, the Fifth Patriarch called me into his room and explained the Diamond Sutra to me. As soon as I heard the words, I understood. And that night, unknown to anyone, I received the Dharma, as he transmitted the robe and the direct teaching to me, and I became the Sixth Patriarch. -- ibid, section 9 > Good friends, if you wish to enter the dharma realm of the deep mind, the samadhi of prajna, you only need to practice the practice of Prajnaparamita. By merely memorizing the Diamond Prajnaparamita Sutra, you will be able to see your nature and enter the prajna samadhi. Indeed, such a person’s merit has no limit, and it is praised in detail in the sutra as beyond description. This is the teaching of the Supreme Vehicle, which is spoken on behalf of those with a great capacity for the highest wisdom. > > [...] > > When those who follow the Mahayana hear about the Diamond Sutra, their minds expand with understanding. -- ibid, section 28 So, explain to me again, how exactly are you nihilists following the Chan patriarchs? Perhaps you should be honest, drop these lineage pretenses, delete your Lineage Texts page which you haven't read, and admit you're just a bunch of lazy-ass edge-lords, who like to endlessly repeat that one-paragraph koan you once read while getting baked, which is the only thing you ever bothered to learn about this ""Zen"" thing you aren't remotely practicing.

7n87kx,"I read something here that made me sad yesterday. It was [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/7n2wiz/how_is_zen_superior_toor_different_froma/) by u/pohw. It asked the very basic question of whether ""physical health, solid friendships and loving relationships, a meditation practice, and a study of philosophy"" can be used as tools, instead of ""Zen"", to ""reduce suffering and create happiness"". u/pohw struck me as someone who genuinely wanted to understand Zen. He's been here for over a month, actively participating, and apparently earnest in his wish to learn about Zen. Yet he is still entirely ignorant of the most basic foundation of what Zen is even about. This forum failed him. This is where the rubber meets the road. This is where the nihilistic assault on Zen that is aggressively passed off here as ""Zen"" bears its fruit of toxic ignorance. So I wrote this post just for you, u/pohw. No, you won't be happy with ""physical health, solid friendships and loving relationships, a meditation practice, and a study of philosophy"". Because these things (let's leave meditation aside for the moment) are **impermanent**, **inherently unsatisfactory**, and **promote an illusion of self**. Your physical health is not guaranteed. Just from the way you refer to it, I am sure you are young and healthy. This will not last, my friend. Your body will be broken down by old age, if not sooner. Solid friendships and loving relationships are less ""solid"" than they seem. Live long enough, and people will repeatedly disappoint you. Maybe because they never really were the image your craving projected onto them. Or maybe because like everything in existence, they are subject to change over time. But fundamentally, because they are not a **permanent object** forever available for **your satisfaction**. They are an impermanent, conditioned realities. Seeing them as such, as *permanent satisfying objects*, is your **delusion**. Your attachment to this delusion gives rise to **craving**, which will inevitably end in **suffering**. And when this suffering comes, your ""study of philosophy"" will not avail you. All these fine observations by Plato, Kant, or even Schopenhauer: what good will they do you when your wife dies, when your friend betrays you, when your health violently fails? That is where the dharma helps us. Philosophy can't liberate you from suffering. All these *objects of craving* you mentioned above will not only ultimately fail to reduce suffering - far from it, they will serve to **produce it**. To indoctrinate you as a productive member, modern society *convinced* you that these *possessions* will help you, but they won't. They are inherently **impermanent** and **unsatisfactory**. The delusion that they are otherwise will itself add much to your misery when the time comes. Plato and Kant and most other philosophers were primarily interested in establishing the *truth*, not in liberating humans from suffering. If you encountered a particular philosopher who is very good at alleviating your suffering, then by all means, let me know. I've studied many philosophers and never found one. All of the above is the foundation of Zen Buddhism. It's why all those ""Zen Masters"" abandoned their ""solid friendships and loving relationships"", and set forth as Buddhist monks in search of enlightenment in the first place.  The Zen teachings most often promoted here are what they taught *other Buddhist monks*, after attaining their own enlightenment. These are very advanced teachings you can study after learning the basic teachings of Buddhism, and establishing a basic practice, which **all these monks - both teachers and disciples - already had**. As an example, let's review this very random quote from the ""Zen Master"" most often (mis)quoted here - Huangbo: > A single moment’s dualistic thought is sufficient to drag you back to the twelvefold chain of causation. It is ignorance which turns the wheel of causation, thereby creating an endless chain of karmic causes and results. This tiny two-sentence passage contains no less than **three** major Buddhist concepts that I guarantee you don't know if you haven't studied Buddhism: 1. [Twelvefold chain of causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Nid%C4%81nas). 2. [The endless chain of karmic causes and results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra_(Buddhism\)). 3. [Non-dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism#Buddhism). The first two can be learned intellectually by studying the fundamentals of Buddhism. The last one requires, in addition to that, a solid meditation practice, grounded in such study. This is a key fragment in Huangbo's Transmission of Mind (section 44), but it is by no means unique. In the next paragraph, Huangbo casually dives into a deep critical analysis of the [Avataṃsaka Sūtra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatamsaka_Sutra). In the one after that, he refers to [Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimalakirti_Sutra). How can he do that?  Is he trying to confuse his readers, keep them away from his teachings? Not at all, because like most texts so often carelessly misquoted here, ""The Transmission of Mind"" was compiled for **trained and educated Buddhist monks**. Huangbo refers to his audience as ""monks"", ""all you monks"", etc throughout the text. I repeat: you had to **study** all the basic Buddhist teachings *and* have an active Buddhist **practice** as a **prerequisite** to attend this course. What we see in this forum is folks who never took these prerequisites, but jumped right into this advanced post-graduate course. They never mastered addition and subtraction, yet they wandered into a multivariate calculus class. Of course, they understand nothing, but they are all intelligent, proud people. So instead of admitting their lack of understanding, they construct an elaborate theory that  this advanced material is all a meaningless joke. If you want to go down this path, go right ahead and directly read the Mumonkan, Blue Cliff Record, and other advanced Zen Buddhist texts you have a toddler-in-calculus-class chance of understanding. Otherwise, embark on a serious [course of study](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/7fs0ox/how_to_practice_zen/) which will gradually give you the necessary knowledge to ultimately realize what Zen is about. At the very least, u/pohw, read some basic introduction to Buddhism, like Thich Nhat Hanh's The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching. It would have answered your question of yesterday. Otherwise, if you don't want to make any effort of genuine practice, then yes, you are correct: maintaining ""physical health, solid friendships, loving relationships, and a study of philosophy"" is a far more effective way of grasping at happiness than smugly misquoting Zen Buddhist teachers all day and pretending you are enlightened. **EDIT:** Happy New Year everyone! 禪 ","Wow.

We do not realize that there never was, is, nor will be any other experience than present experience. We are therefore out of touch with reality.

bvr0x7,"# Debunking Ewk's views on meditation Confusion has been spreading on this forum as to what is the relationship between Zen and meditation because of some users. The claim is that meditation has been denounced times and times over by Zen master through the ages as something that was incoherent with Zen practice. This view is completely contrary to the facts. Boddhidharma, a ***buddhist*** **monk considered as the first chinese patriarch, is said to have spent nine years in a cave, facing a wall, not speaking the entire time.** In the Two Entrances and Four Acts, traditionally attributed to Bodhidharma, the term ""wall-gazing"" is given as follows: >Those who turn from delusion back to reality, who meditate on walls, the absence of self and other, the oneness of mortal and sage, and who remain unmoved even by scriptures are in complete and unspoken agreement with reason"" Ewk remains silent on that point for a good reason: He sees meditation as an active practice and often denounces proponents of it as **religious trolls**. I do not know what he thinks meditation is about when he says such things, but he is clearly misguided. It is easy to make the mistake of believing that meditation has an object other than presence, in other words, that it aims at concentration upon something through efforts of the will. Meditation is observation, and sitting in quietness is a good way to get acquainted with what the mind produces without stimulation that could be attributed to the outside world. Successful meditation is not meditation, and in that way, **to achieve the meditative state is much like solving a koan**. You must cease effort without intending to do so, you must achieve presence without thinking about it. This does not require sitting meditation, just as enlightenment does not necessarily entails thorough koan practice, but it can help. This is why many people turn away from meditation, because they just end up being stuck in a loop of thinking ""I must think about nothing"", or ""I am present"". This ""I am present is often referred to by the popular saying ""If you meet a Buddha on the road, kill him"". ## Ewk's Zensangha wiki page &#x200B; Ewk views are documented [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zensangha/wiki/notmeditation), so you can see for yourself that I am not attacking a strawman. Ewk documents many instances of Zen masters talking about meditation. Here are some: ## Huineng &#x200B; >Huineng: ""To concentrate the mind on quietness is a disease of the mind, and not Zen at all. What an idea, restricting the body to sitting all the time! That is useless."" Ewk's interpretation, that he passes as fact, is that Huineng thus condemns *all* meditation. **In reality, in section 57 of the Platform Sutra, Huineng recommends meditation to his students and passes away in sitting in meditation** Ewk's confusion comes from the fact that he misinterpret's huineng when it is said that to him, Samadhi and Prajna (concentration and wisdom) are not two separate things. ## Mazu >If you try to sit like buddha you are just killing Buddha. (p. 60) The important word here is try. This is in no way an indictment of meditation. >Meditation is neither sitting or lying. Meditation is not an act, to sit is not necessarily meditation. >You should simply step back and study through total experience. How do you step back? I am not telling you to sit on a bench with your eyes closed, rigidly suppressing body and mind, like earth or wood. That will never have any usefulness, even in a million years. There is a way to sit and to try to achieve a state when there is nothing to attain. This is not meditation. There is no supression of body and mind in meditation, just observance. ## On Ewk's behavior generally Those who know me may know that I strongly disapprove of Ewk's toxic behavior on this forum. **People that disagree with you are not liars and trolls, they hold different views. There is a great difference between having different perspectives and lying, and accusations of the sort are just making this place toxic**.

bygue6,">“Zen Buddhism is a way and a view of life which does not belong to any of the formal categories of modern Western thought. It is not religion or philosophy; it is not a psychology or a type of science. It is an example of what is known in India and China as a “way of liberation,” and is similar in this respect to Taoism, Vedanta, and Yoga. As will soon be obvious, a way of liberation can have no positive definition. It has to be suggested by saying what it is not, somewhat as a sculptor reveals an image by the act of removing pieces of stone from a block.” Alan Watts, The Way of Zen","I’m in an internal debate as to whether or not Alan Watts had Joshu zen.  Joshu zen, as in the knowing of one’s true nature, not just the possession of a highly refined, personal nature which grasps at the truth.  My overall conclusion is that no, Alan Watts probably did not have Joshu zen, in part because readers don’t seem to awaken to Joshu zen after only reading Alan Watts. “The Way of Zen” and “On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are” and “Nature of Consciousnesses” are three very cool books, nonetheless.

cl67fs,"I'm not going to say anything about the true meaning of Zen, that was just clickbait. I'm sorry. (Not sorry). This post is going to be about etymology.  The intractable disputes that we like to have around this subreddit are semantic. (Wittgenstein wus right and Popper is a damn fool, don't @ me). There is one trait that unites most of the prominent posters here, the moderators, and the immature zealots who ""run"" the kotw/zmotm (""run"" is in quotes since... you know, the lack of any competency). They all have orthodox opinions on Zen that they want to push on everyone else. It is always, of course, their own *idiosyncratic* orthodoxy, but it's still an attempt to use the name, ""Zen"" to get attention for yourself and preach your own views to others.  Take for example the types who think that all Japanese Zen Buddhism is ""Not Zen""™, eschewing these masters in favor of the Chinese Chan Buddhists. Some of them are bristling right now while reading the words ""Zen"" or ""Chan"" in combination with the word ""Buddhism"", which is a symptom of their confusion, but I digress. The fact remains that we got the word, ""Zen"" in English in direct reference to the Soto and Rinzai schools. A more appropriate place for people to post about the Chinese masters would be /r/chan... but, of course, the word, ""Zen"" is much more popular and recognizable in English. If your goal is attention, that would be the wrong move. There aren't magazines in health food stores that say, ""Find your inner Chan"", with a picture of a white woman meditating and looking serene on them. There is no commodified, popular zeitgeist to rage against, or from which to parasitize influence. If you said the word Chan to most people in the USA, they'd have no idea what you were talking about. If you mentioned Zhaozhou or Daoxin, most people would probably meet that with a blank stare. The Chan masters really aren't that famous. Actually, the reason *why* we remember these folks much at all is because of D.T. Suzuki and others bringing the teachings of Soto and Rinzai to the United States. The term entered the popular consciousness less because people were going to the store to pick up the Wumenguan but more because they were reading, at first, Zen in the Art of Archery by Herrigal, and then Zen & the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Pirsig.  A couple things to consider at this point: 1. Anyone who asserts that someone like Herrigal or Persig were riding on the fame or coattails of Zen masters is either employing fallacious thinking, or is profoundly ignorant. These people popularized Zen  (in the western world), Zen didn't popularize their works. I know, I know. The Zen masters are really important to *us*, so we like to project their importance onto world history.  2. The rejection of Japanese Zen Buddhism is all well and good, but then you should leave the forum and start a new forum based on the Chan masters. This is a forum about Zen, and like it or not you can't change the common, widely-accepted and colloquial meaning of the term. You also can't escape from reckoning with the *origins* of the term, which derives from western exposure to, specifically, Soto and Rinzai Buddhism. (Actually you can escape from reckoning with that, since this forum is an object lesson in escapism). Now, the title of this post is that orthodox views are poison, and you may be wondering how this ties into these considerations.  The fact of the matter is that, if we take the word ""Zen"" for its common meaning, then it colloquially means a state of calm or relaxation. Yeah, I know: we all hate this definition. It doesn't square with the picture of the Zen masters very well. Unfortunate, I suppose, but what can you do, really? It's the reality. Denotatively, ""Zen"" refers to the Buddhist tradition that reached America and the western world through the teachings of Japanese Zen. But what about ""dhyana""? You know, the word that Zen is a translation of, which Chan is a translation of, and which is the true referent and meaning of any discussion on Zen? Is that the way to get out of this dilemma, to just go straight to the substance? Well: even dhyana is a transliteration of jhana, and when we look throughout the historical record we can find many different definitions and interpretations of the term. The earliest talk of Zen (jhana) in written form which we have preserved today survives in the Pali canon, used by the Theravadins. Here is a bit on the etymology, from Henepola Gunaratana (Sri Lankan monk): >Buddhaghosa traces the Pali word ""jhana"" (Skt. dhyana) to two verbal forms. One, the etymologically correct derivation, is the verb *jhayati*, meaning to think or meditate; the other is a more playful derivation, intended to illuminate its function rather than its verbal source, from the verb jhapeti meaning to burn up. He explains: ""It burns up opposing states, thus it is jhana"" (Vin.A. i, 116), the purport being that jhana ""burns up"" or destroys the mental defilements preventing the developing the development of serenity and insight.” Jhana was typically associated with meditative states and the Pali canon asserts this unequivocally in its telling of Gautama Buddha's enlightenment story and his studies under various Indian meditation masters. The term Zen (now dhyana) also appeared in Hinduism. Dhyana is one of the eight branches of the Hindu yoga practice, but as to how far this goes back, it’s hard to say. ""Dhyāna"": A dharma of the yoga, kills unrighteous qualities; given by Krishan to Uddhana; Bhāgavata-purāṇa XI. 14. 32-46. – a text written between the 6th-10th century AD/CE. Dhyana is also one of the Hindu mudras, which is a hand-sign which indicates : the left hand is opened fully and placed on the lap, over which a similarly opened right hand is placed. In Nagarjuna’s Dharmasamghara – a compendium of Buddhist terms and concepts, he lists the types of ""Zens"" (dhyanas), this would be in the second century CE: >the first absorption has thinking, reflection, and the happiness and joy born of seclusion, >the second has internal clarity, and happiness and joy, >the third is equanimous, mindful, and has full knowledge, >the fourth absorption has complete purity of mindfulness and equanimity, with feeling that is neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant. This seems to reflect the jhanas of the Pali traditions, and it's worth noting that the translator opted for ""absorption"" here, since that is one commonly-used way of translating the term.  Then, we have the term ""Tridhyāna"" (""Tri-Zen!""), which refers to the “three kinds of meditation” as defined in the Dharma-saṃgraha (section 109): >sadoṣāpakarṣa-dhyāna (meditation with fault that leads to decay), >sukhavaihārika-dhyāna (meditation that is a happy abiding), >aśeṣavaibhūṣita-dhyāna (meditation that is entirely magnificent). By this point, your eyes are starting to glaze over, and you may be wondering what my point is. Personally, while I find many of these old texts perfect for study, they're not very helpful to the modern-day Zen practitioner, and being that they're written by Buddhist monks, the main concern seems to be to categorize teachings into numeric systems at every turn. But what should be clear by now is that term Zen - jhana in Pali, and dhyana in Sanskrit - had a rich history of use by multiple traditions centuries before Bodhidharma was born. There were concrete associations with this word by prominent Buddhist commentators, such as Nagarjuna - and we ought to take Nagarjuna's opinions pretty seriously, given that he would later be canonized as an Indian Patriarch of Zen during the time of the Song dynasty Chan masters, so obviously the old guys liked what he had to say and decided to retcon him into the line.  Moving forward, we could take a look at one of the most underrated sutras of all time - the Sutra of Queen Srimala's Roar - which was a big influence on Mahayana Buddhism more broadly: >Good sons and daughters teach tranquility, constant mindfulness not conditioned by external objects, and recollection of all actions and speech over long periods of time to those who respond to dhyana. By protecting these [living beings’] intentions, they teach them. When they are thus taught and caused to abide in the True Dharma, this is called the perfection of dhyana. Here we have a description of Zen, where it is linked to: teaching, as well as 'constant mindfulness not conditioned by external objects'. Or, in another sutra which no one can deny was the primary influence on Bodhidharma's teaching, we might look at the Lankavatara sutra (LXXXIX): >Not becoming attached to the nirvana of shravakas when projections cease, this is the perfection of dhyana. Here the 'perfection' of Zen is described thusly: when one is so advanced at not becoming attached to projections of their own mind, they don't even become attached to the ""nirvana"" that the shravakas (Theravadins, or ""Hinayanists"") imagine. There's more of that talk about not being conditioned by external objects, but when you 'perfect' Zen, you're not even conditioned by the unconditioned. It's worth noting here that the term 'perfection' refers to the 'paramitas', which are basically a form of Buddhist virtue ethics. In Mahayana Buddhism, with the emphasis on emptiness, it becomes somewhat difficult to make concrete claims about what kind of behavior is appropriate, so a sort of dialectical process happens whereby the virtues are both affirmed as real and relevant to one's life but also practiced devoid of any ideas of their realness or even that one is practicing something. Bodhidharma went on to expain this in his treatise, 'Two Entries and Four Practices' (Tanlin, 6th century): >Since this Dharma is fundamentally without parsimony, he should practice [the perfection of] charity, giving of his body, life, and possessions without any regret in his mind. Thoroughly understanding the three nonsubstantialities [of recipient, donor, and gift], he neither swerves [from his course] nor becomes attached [to anything], but merely rids himself of his own defilements and aids in the salvation of other sentient beings—all without grasping at characteristics (i.e., without conceptualizing the existence of self and sentient beings, etc.). In this way he benefits himself as well as others; he ornaments the path of enlightenment. Charity is [to be undertaken] as above; the other five [perfections are performed] in the same manner. To eradicate wrong thoughts and practice the six perfections—but while being without any “practice”—this is the practice of accordance with the Dharma. While this passage concerns itself with 'dana', we can see how the same principles can be applied to the 'virtue of Zen' ('dhyana'): if we take the association with meditative practice as definitive, for example, we can see that Bodhidharma would be saying to practice without the conception of a practitioner, of a goal to a be reached, or any benefit to himself. In fact, as he says himself in the final lines: practice while being without any ""practice"". Or, we might take the more basic associations with absorption, and apply the same formula. By the time of the Southern School and the onset of the subitist craze, we can see how the paramitas were artfully wrapped into this mindset, such as in the Sudden Enlightenment Treatise: >When wondrous stillness flourishes and the body of reality spontaneously appears, this comprises dhyanaparamita, the perfection of dhyana. The Sudden Enlightenment Treatise is generally considered to be a hybrid text, as we can see the term ""wondrous stillness"" had not yet been purged from the popular consciousness by Shen-hui's sectarian disciples... and yet, here it is alongside an emphasis on spontaneity. **Conclusions** The term Zen has been translated into countless languages. It meant different things to different people. It meant something centuries before Bodhidharma was born. It meant something to Bodhidharma. Then he died, and a bunch of other people have been fighting ever since then to argue that they ""know what Bodhidharma *really* meant""... mainly people who never knew him or anyone who even met him. Through woo-woo supernatural claims about ""mind to mind transmission"" we've been conned into thinking that some people can just automatically have more authority on this subject than others because of qualities that us unenlightened masses can't observe, test or verify. Thus, we get cults: not unlike the cult mentality that we see on full display in this forum.  It may be easy to say, no salts, Japan was where the cults were, Dogen was a liar, a fraud, and a sex predator, etc. This is what we call, in formal logic, a ""red herring"". It really has zero to do with the issues I am raising here. If Dogen tried to claim ownership of Zen or the lineage, then he was wrong to do so, sure. But if you can't address the fundamental reasons why Dogen *or anyone else* is ultimately unable to do such a thing, you're likely to fall into yet another orthodoxy. I'm not going to bore you with a bunch of Zen master quotes about orthodoxy being bullshit (but if you *[must](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/62o6t8/at_least_ten_ways_that_your_practice_has_gone/?ref=search_posts)*). You know it's true anyway, deep down.  It may also be easy to then set up a strawman and say, ""salts just wants to say Zen can be anything and everything anyone says it is, and this forum is about what Zen masters taught"" and blah blah blah. Again, missing the point so badly that it might as well be a 747 flying thousands of feet over your head. The simple fact is that we'll always have the facts to argue over: imagining that you'll ever force a definition into widespread acceptance is a fantasy. I'm actually comfortable with the differing views on this forum. The FAQ used to say (maybe it still does?) that Zen is ""variously understood"" and this forum officially takes no position on how Zen is to be defined. Do the mods follow this in practice? No. Maybe that's why NorthstarIV left. He saw through the orthodoxy, saw the poison that they all drank... and wanted none of it.

dax1ij,"It’s like you took a bottle of ink and you threw it at a wall. Smash! And all that ink spread. And in the middle, it’s dense, isn’t it? And as it gets out on the edge, the little droplets get finer and finer and make more complicated patterns, see? So in the same way, there was a big bang at the beginning of things and it spread. And you and I, sitting here in this room, as complicated human beings, are way, way out on the fringe of that bang. We are the complicated little patterns on the end of it. Very interesting. But so we define ourselves as being only that. If you think that you are only inside your skin, you define yourself as one very complicated little curlique, way out on the edge of that explosion. Way out in space, and way out in time. Billions of years ago, you were a big bang, but now you’re a complicated human being. And then we cut ourselves off, and don’t feel that we’re still the big bang. But you are. Depends how you define yourself. You are actually–if this is the way things started, if there was a big bang in the beginning– you’re not something that’s a result of the big bang. You’re not something that is a sort of puppet on the end of the process. You are still the process. You are the big bang, the original force of the universe, coming on as whoever you are.

Yangshan Huiji [807-883] __________________________________________ Commentary and questions: This case is a perfect example of Dharma combat between a gifted student and his skilled master.

To this, the master challenges ""You only understand things,"" which presses Yangshan even further.

Yangshan then asks ""Why do you call it things?"", completely upending the dynamic all at once and settling the matter.

There is this profound focus on the transcending of words, which denote concepts. We find this trap among the common people of religion, which is to confuse belief in a concept with the concept itself, and thus one's belief becomes a veil that prevents direct access to the concept that the belief points at. Of course, the reality of the concept itself transcends concept and categories, and at this point, to articulate it is to conceptualize it, and therefore, to reduce the transcendent reality to immanent illusory form.",16

I used a note pad and pencil to communicate, and since writing is inconvenient as it takes a long time, I was forced to only tell people things when it was important. When you shut your mouth, you open your mind. I definitely learned this today. Although I was with people for most of the day, I felt as if they weren’t there a lot of the time. This allowed me to feel isolated. I had a lot of time to think. At times it was stressful, but over all I was more relaxed than usual, because I simply accepted that I couldn’t tell people everything on my mind. It was meditative in a way. It feels as if not only I am silent, but that the whole world is silent. I honestly recommend everyone to try this, as it truly is soothing. It’s not as hard as I thought it’d be. Communicated was mostly sufficient with nods and groans, but if I needed to say something specific, I’d simply write it. Every cashier and retailer understood too.

eaijwy,"As soon as the mouth is opened, evils spring forth. People either neglect the root and speak of the branches, or neglect the reality of the 'illusory' world and speak only of Enlightenment. Or else they chatter of cosmic activities leading to transformations, while neglecting the Substance from which they spring—indeed, there is *never* any profit in discussion. Once more, *all* phenomena are basically without existence, though you cannot now say that they are *nonexistent*. Karma having arisen does not thereby exist; karma destroyed does not thereby cease to exist. Even its root does not exist, for that root is no root. Moreover, Mind is not Mind, for whatever that term connotes is far from the reality it symbolizes. Form, too, is not really form. So if I now state that there are no phenomena and no Original Mind, you will begin to understand something of the intuitive Dharma silently conveyed to Mind with Mind. Since phenomena and no-phenomena are one, there is neither phenomena nor no-phenomena, and the only possible transmission is to Mind with Mind. **Huangbo Xiyun**, *On the Transmission of Mind*, translated by John Blofeld, 1958 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Wandering Ronin's last commentary and questions**: I'm sure that this post will generate a few last waves of problems and potential controversies, but I assure you that this is not my intention.

Very few can apparently break their habitual thoughts or karmic conditioning, which is a part of why I'm finally leaving once and for all.  For a pointer, those who engage in pure conditioned reasoning, thinking that they're speaking to ""Wandering Ronin"" based on their preconceived notions of the past instead of the real ""Wandering Ronin"" aren't really speaking to me at all.  There's no spontaneity or freedom there whatsoever, and I must go where there is radiant illumination as opposed to more delusion, suffering and darkness. Metaphorically speaking, I'm retiring up into the hermitage in the mountains, and those who wish to seek me out will still find me by direct message, but of course there won't be many.  There's no sense in continuing any daily public engagement with the forum, as from what I've seen over time, the vast majority of people here aren't really interested in Zen.  Bickering and fighting, the endless pointlessness of *this* over *that*, mere temporary distractions as opposed to illuminating radiance; what does any of that have to do with the Dharma?  Much of that only serves to obscure the moon, and as Huangbo teaches above, *there is never any profit in discussion*.  Those who can see through and give back are so precious and few; why *is* that? A few people warned me earlier when I first came into the forum that this place has nothing to do with Zen, and I understand this deeply now.  It's also telling how few posts that there are in direct relation to the teachings of the Zen masters here.  Bear in mind that we're also not seen as even worth having a full moderation team here, or one that even bothers to prevent the usual bullying, harassment and slander seriously in any way.  Would any of that have been allowed in any way, shape or form in the Zen monasteries of old?  That all has an obvious and serious price to it: the way that this place is allowed to be from the lack of authority *directly* increases the toxicity and drives off many of the people who would have a real interest in Zen, leaving more and more egocentric people here who only want to posture and gain notoriety as false authorities.  What scholar or person who has attained the mastery of the ancients would have anything to do with this place seeing it in the condition it's kept?

What would be the purpose of taking up a practice and developing understanding in the Way taught by the ancient masters of Chan?  There are of course many potential reasons for such an undertaking, some would even say that there is no purpose, but one of the most common reasons would be to find an end to suffering. If the nature of suffering is to be understood through the path towards realization, then it would perhaps be best to look back to the roots of Zen in the attributed teachings of the Buddha.  The ancient masters of Chan apparently didn't discuss suffering, but seem to have circumvented the issue by cutting through to the heart of the matter with the practice of pointing directly towards mind itself, which is the very root source of all suffering to begin with. This Way of Zen, pointing directly towards the mind of the practitioner, is apparent in the wisdom in verse written above by Mumon: *Don't draw another's bow, Don't ride another's horse, Don't discuss another's faults, Don't explore another's affairs*.  Why does Mumon teach this?  In part it is because to discuss the faults of others or to explore another's affairs is to unskillfully look away from mind and create the separation of *self* from *other*.  To place blame and consequence outside of one's own mind has nothing to do with looking within, and to make such distinctions cannot lead to realization. Regarding suffering, it would also be wise to understand and utilize what is arguably the greatest teaching of Huangbo Xiyun, which is the practice of putting a stop to conceptual thinking.  Seeing through conceptual thinking for what it is alleviates a great deal of suffering.  This practice would also include being diligent against getting tangled up in the delusional concepts of others who have no real interest in the practice of Zen, many of whom would extend their own afflictions universally.","Wow. It is really amazing that on this sub a post that literally says ""don't discuss another's faults"" has this effect. Open question: Is there anybody who is actually reflecting on themselves? Or everyone has moved on beyond the illusion of a separate being and is functioning completely freely and unimpeded right?

If someone who knows tells him it has nothing to do with the things them­selves, he stubbornly refuses to believe it. The knowing one tells him to simply wipe his nose with his hand, but he won’t. Were he willing to wipe his nose, only then could he know he was already getting somewhere; finally he would wash it off with water, and there would be no foul odor at all. Whatever he smelled, that foul odor wouldn’t be there from the start. Study­ing Zen is also like this; those who will not stop and watch them­selves on their own instead pursue intellectual interpretation, but that pursuit of intellectual interpretation, seeking rationales and making comparative judgments is all completely off.

go4l99,"This post is the first in a series looking at distinctly Buddhist words in Zen texts. I've been studying Chinese for about 8 years (first modern while living for 4 years in the greater China area, and then  classical Chinese for the last couple years (which are two different, though related, language systems)), and while my Chinese is far from perfect, I can find my way around these texts and enjoy doing so. This series is inspired by an exchange I had that revealed to me how misguided the normative understanding of these texts is on this board (you can find the original exchange here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/gjv7yc/practicing\_zen\_with\_wumenguan\_case\_2/fqqklft?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/gjv7yc/practicing_zen_with_wumenguan_case_2/fqqklft?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)) I want to first draw our attention that every proponent of the notion of “Zen is not Buddhism” on these boards **cannot read Chinese**. I would love for one person on these boards who can read Chinese to step up and defend this position. Those people on the board who claim ""Zen is not Buddhism"" pretend to be experts on these texts, but are **illiterate** in the original language of these texts. Think about the degree of ego and attachment necessary to think you are an expert on something you can't read. All information they’ve received on Zen has been filtered through 20th/21st century modern English, prepared for a modern, secular, Western audience, and commensurately distorted owing to this translation/filtration/modernizing process. There’s a lot I would like to say, but I will spread this out by focusing on one or two Chinese Buddhist words found in Zen texts for each post. I will begin by drawing our attention to two words: 僧 (Buddhist monk) and 和尚 (preceptor – the one who gives vows to Buddhist monks). Here is a brief sampling of how common 僧 and 和尚 are in these texts. Wumen Guan: Case 1: 趙州**和尚**因**僧**問。狗子還有佛性。也無。州云無。 Case 2: 住在山後。敢告**和尚**。乞依亡**僧**事例... Case 3: 俱胝**和尚**。凡有詰問…. Case 5: 香嚴**和尚**云... Case 7: 趙州因**僧**問。某甲乍入叢林。乞師指示。州云。喫粥了也未。**僧**云。喫粥了也。州云。洗鉢盂去。其**僧**有省。 I skipped over a few in just these seven cases, and I could keep going for all 48 cases, but you get the point. All of these dialogues are between **Buddhist monks** with the Zen master (Zhaouzhou 趙州, Xiangyan 香嚴, Juzhi 俱胝) referred to as preceptor (和尚, meaning they **make other people into Buddhist monks)** and the disciple/congregation referred to as 僧 (ordinary, lowly monk). Wumen Guan contains 44 uses of 僧, and 26 uses of 和尚. You can search for these words here using command+F: [https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T2005\_001](https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T2005_001) Blue Cliff Record contains 83 uses of 僧, and 14 uses of 和尚: [https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T2003\_001](https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T2003_001) The Book of Serenity contains 56 uses of the word 僧, and 29 uses of the word 和尚: [https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T2004\_001](https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T2004_001) To say that these texts are not Buddhist is to deny the clear Buddhist affiliation of the very monks who wrote this text. Furthermore, look at the content of these cases: Buddhist monks talking and arguing over ideas such as Buddhanature (佛性 Case 1), cause and effect (Case 2), enlightenment (Case 3), etc. To say that this is not Buddhist feels **willfully delusional**. The response here is usually “Define Buddhism!” – easy: **Buddhism is what Buddhists do**. If Buddhist monks, those who call themselves Buddhist, are doing Zen things, then Zen things are Buddhist. What makes something American? **What Americans do** (eat hamburgers, drive pickup trucks, be loud and obnoxious, etc). Take any category of people broad enough (nationality, religious affiliation, political affiliation), and this is the definition you will get. Of course, there are also subdivisions, splintering, subcategories, sects, outliers, etc – which is why any rigid, limited, narrow definition of any category that’s so broad is a **simplistic, reductionist, anti-intellectual way of approaching our understanding of the world.** And yes, a way of defining that reflects reality means that if reality became (even more) absurd, then the definition would reflect that. If all people who call themselves Americans started walking on their hands, this would be American. If all people who call themselves Buddhists started quacking like a duck, this would be Buddhist. But these things won't happen, because reality is determined by a sequence of events. All we can do is look at what we have. I am not interested in hypotheticals. Are Zen Masters a unique kind of Buddhist? Certainly. Does that mean they are not Buddhist? They are monks, expressing the nature of Enlightenment, talking about Buddha, and the nature of mind. Is there secular value in these texts? Absolutely. **I think we can still gain secular value from these texts without having to force them, through a limited and incomplete understanding of their language, to perfectly align with our 21st century, modern, Western cultural conditioning**. It’s OK for texts from medieval China to be Buddhist and for us to enjoy them still. They don’t have to be secular to be of value. I will continue this later in another post looking at other distinctly Buddhist words (佛法, 佛性, 悟, etc.) that appear all over these texts. \*edited a couple typos\*",I'm less than a southern barbarian but I'm choosing to not be distracted by the tags on luggage.

hi2lcd,"Meditation master Huang [...] built a hut, and sat constantly for twenty years, never evincing any slacking. Later he met a disciple of the sixth patriarch, Chan master Ce, who had come to the area on his travels.  He heard that Huang had studied with the fifth patriarch and had been living in a hut for many years, considering himself correctly attuned.  Ce knew that Huang’s attainment was not consummate, so he went and asked him, “What are you doing sitting here?”  He said, “Entering concentration.” Ce said, “You say you are entering concentration—mindful or mindless?  If mindful, all creatures would have attained concentration; if mindless, all plants and trees would have attained concentration.” Huang said, “When I actually go into concentration, I don’t see the existence of any mind that is there or not.” Ce said, “If you don’t see the existence of any mind present or absent, this is constant concentration—how could there be coming out or going in?  If there is exit and entry, this is not great concentration.” [...] [Huang] went to call on the sixth patriarch. The patriarch was sympathetic to him having come from afar, and gave him instruction at once. Huang was enlightened at his words. The state of mind he’d attained over the previous twenty years had no more influence at all. ______________ I'm reading a translation of ""The Book of Job"" by Robert Alter. His notes are excellent, exhaustively defending every important translation choice. It makes me long for a Zen translator who bothers to show his work. Presumably 'concentration' is Cleary's translation of 'dhyana' (if you know better, please do correct me). But both words bear the contextual burden of a century of Orientalist 'Buddhism.' 'Mindful' has similar issues. I think Cleary makes Ce's point unnecessarily susceptible to his Western audience's prejudices. Mine, at least. Still, Ce's point is beautifully clear: 'The Way' is not a state of mind, nor a state of mindlessness; it is unrelated to the direction of one's attention, and it cannot be practiced. So we can finally stop having those arguments over and over again now, right guys? How good. The last paragraph is wonderful as well. I love the way the piece doesn't depict Huang's little chat with Huineng. It was probably typical boilerplate Zen. Leave out the words, and all you see is a guy lose a habit.

hx1wlf,"Sorry for using Christian parables here, but I'm more familiar with them and I have come to believe that the garden of Eden story communicates the same idea which Zen also points towards.  Adam and Eve and all the animals lived happily in the garden because they lived in their natural ""Zen"" state, when they were hungry they ate, and when they were tired they slept. They were naked, but they did not know about this, or at least they didn't make any judgements about it, it simply was how things were, they accepted this and did not question or try to change anything.  ""The way"" is perfect, and we humans on our own are not. So our judgements of ""good & evil"" and our knowledge will always be lacking, thus it's better that we do not make any judgements at all, it's not the place of a single pebble to tell the whole road that it goes the wrong way.  ""The way"" also only works because it cannot be known or heard or seen. If you know how a movie ends before watching it, it ruins it. Clouds are beautiful because I am looking at the clouds, not because I know the exact molecular structure of them. Hell, I don't even need to know that they are clouds or anything, they are cool as shit and I can just watch them all day.  I think it's clear that more knowledge is not what makes us happy. Thanks to our knowledge, we have all this amazing technology, but it's destroying our planet, our bodies and our minds, we would be better off without it. Nuclear weapons, for example, make it clear that giving this sort of knowledge to humans is equivalent of giving a gun to a monkey. We tried to improve what cannot be improved, doing so only makes it worse.  It's enjoyable to take a walk because my legs move on their own, it would be a nightmare if I had to consciously and knowingly choose to move every muscle. People enjoy dancing, music and sex, as these things allow us to forget our sense of time and to be in the moment, these things allow us to forget our own sense of self and silence the voice of judgement inside our head. When top athletes perform and when great artists create art, they don't do this from a state where they are aware of themselves, they don't do this from active thinking and knowledge, they do this from the opposite, a flow state. Don't think, just do. Don't do, just be.  If we can agree on all this, I suppose then the question is: what exactly is ""ordinary mind"", and what is the best way to attain it? From my understanding of Zen Buddhism, most Zen masters are actually against the idea of sitting in Zazen in temples for many hours every day. Doing this might be a useful antidote to the insanity of the layman's world and may help one to silence the mind, but the goal here is to attain ""ordinary mind"" and not ""no-mind"". There's no use in being a stone Buddha and so on, you might just as well go jump off a cliff.  I think the answer is obvious, it's nature, nature shows us the way without human corruption. The trees grow and the birds fly perfectly because they simply are, they do not think and they do not judge. They do not sit and argue in front of a screen all day, but they also do not sit in a temple and do nothing all day. It then seems to me that our best role models are not snarky Zen monks in temples, but the indigenous people around the world that live in harmony with nature. I recently went up to live with the Sami people in northern Scandinavia and they know all of this already. There's no need for ""holy books"" to teach you that killing and stealing is wrong, there's no need for science textbooks and ""knowledge"" to tell you that destroying the environment means destroying yourself, these things are simply self-evident when one lives in a natural way.   Then the question arises of what exactly is natural or not. It certainly is not this concrete-clad capitalist hellscape that we have created. The bible and Voltaire speak about a garden that we should cultivate, but it's easy to see that agriculture is not quite natural either, hunter-gatherer cultures are even more in tune with nature. What's implied in at least classic Buddhism is that our true nature is not any sort of human or earthly nature, but the Buddha-nature, oneness with everything and simultaneously completely empty, free from all forms and conceptions, including all those used in this very sentence of course.  So what's the Zen take on this, is the garden the Earth without the curse of knowledge, or are all these ideas about what is ""natural"" and not just another thing distracting me from reaching magical formless nirvana-land? I would appreciate some insights, thanks.","Zen Masters say you contain the garden within you. How can you be exhiled from yourself? There is nothing ""simple"" about that.",25
i0txut,"Occasionally people... misbehave... in this forum.  They get called out about their conduct, which they know is creepy, sketchy, and beneath them, but they will try to crawl out of it by saying ""no big deal"". They are right... Zen practice doesn't have a moral standard, and thus no moral scale... there are no big deals in Zen.  Buddhists and Christians have a hierarchy of karmical sinfulness, Zen doesn't roll that way.  Sex predators aren't ""bad"" and Zen Masters aren't ""good"".  Alt_troll religious haters aren't better than Hitler but worse than Trump.  There isn't a scale of suckage in Zen. **See Guishan's teaching to Yangshan: *I don't care about your conduct*.** However, not to be be able to turn freely... not to be able to reply to any question... to be forced by one's self importance to kneel before an alter of ""size of the deal"" is absolutely a big deal in Zen. Thus there are no big deals, but every deal, by virtue of it being a deal *at all*, is a Zen deal. When people pretend to be Zen teachers, they are liars.  When somebody says something is ""not a big deal"", they are trying to assert the authority to establish value based on assumed authority; a lie twice over. That's the Zen deal there. Such people have no teacher, no students, no lineage, no enlightenment, and no practice.  That's not a big deal... but it is a Zen deal. It is not the size of the transgression, it is the perception of their being a transgression.  It is not a transgression by virtue of it's transgressiveness, it is a transgression because somebody has no answer but a lie.",Oh boy.,14

I asked it a few questions about Eastern Philosophy which led to this rather interesting exchange. It reminded me of r/Zen and I thought you’d enjoy this response. *The Indian philosophers want to hide the fact that there are no secrets in philosophy. The reason for this is because they have realised that it is impossible to make a living as a philosopher without keeping secrets.* *They have realised that if they admit to the fact that there are no secrets, then no one will need them any longer. They know everyone can find out everything for themselves by doing a little bit of reading and thinking.* *This is because the philosophers, like everyone else who has ever lived or will live, are afraid of death. They do not want to die and so they need a way to make money.* *They have realised that the best way to make money is through making people think they need them. And so, if everyone knows everything about philosophy, then there will be no more demand for philosophers.* *So, they have created a secret society in which only other philosophers are allowed to know that there are no secrets.* Even an AI knows that there’s nothing to figure out, what’s taking you lot so long?

In this way, humans have created their own world inside their minds by labeling everything they see around them with different labels; each word representing something else.

There is that aspect of it and it's wonderful and important. We can find the joys of this philosophy in so many poetic and interesting stories of the Masters of the past. But what we should not forget is that the background and legitimacy of that approach to life and that Philosophy comes from a deep and sustained background of engagement with life at the raw experiential level. These teachers and students and Masters of the old texts were not only charismatic and sharp in their minds. They were also deeply devoted people. Choosing to live their lives in a way that was separate from the traditional society at the time. Most of them being buddhist Monks their entire lives, living at temples, and sometimes wandering through the world with very few possessions. This is the kind of experiential and engaged aspect of Zen that cannot be disregarded when approaching the mindset and overarching Philosophy of Zen.   &nbsp;  I think the moderators should hold themselves to a higher level of responsibility and accountability in facilitating this space to be a entry point to actually understanding and practicing Zen. Ignoring and avoiding the approach of **All Modern Schools of Zen** such as the **Thién school as it exists in Vietnam**, the **Zen school as it exists in Japan**, the **Seon school as it exists in Korea**, and of course the original **Chán school as it exists in China and in places such as Taiwan** is not appropriate. &nbsp;  Also keeping in mind that there are modern Zen training centers all of the western world as well.  They are in many cases run by and for people interested in looking into the nature of their reality and their lives through Meditation and study of Zen texts.   &nbsp;  Are they perfect places of *Pure Zen*…? No of course not, they are run by human beings and human beings cause all kinds of problems. That doesn't diminish the value of being in spiritual community with experienced practioners who've applied the teachings of Zen in their own lives and have experienced major results because of it. &nbsp;  There are many many modern scholars and teachers of Zen such as Reb Anderson, Thich Nhat Han, Master Sheng Yen, Roshi Joan Halifax, and of course Hsu Yun(Empty Cloud) and many many other modern teachers that have spent decades upon decades upon decades in research, study, and Intensive Meditation.  Most of the people listed have modern schools and centers where almost anyone can go and learn about and practice Zen. There teachings set the standards of Zen practice and training and we shouldn't disregard the modern approaches to training in and studying Zen Buddhism. Such as but not limited to, study, Meditation, and being apart of a community of like-minded practioners who have more experience. Compassion and Maturation are at the very core and heart of Zen training. &nbsp;  Whoever is reading this, May you be well and happy. May you be at peace.

This is one of those times when zen is upside down and inside out if you try to line it up with conventional. And yet the biggest mistake we can make is think that zen abandons discipline.

The words are tricky,   lead to plenty of upsets,  if we let them start to pin things down.    Stick with the self evident,   and gravity will pin down anything that needs pinning.   The rest of it can happen out of non-doing.    Kicks and blows come and go with no shame,  no guilt,  and no bad conscience.

jfrc4s,"The purpose of this post is to ask some common zen questions and present direct answers that are intentionally free of zen colloquialism, obscure metaphors, poetry, references requiring further reading, or specific historical context. I hope this will be useful to some. Here we go: # What is an 'enlightened' person like? The mind of a wayfarer is plain and direct, without artificiality.  There is neither avoidance nor obsession, no deceptive wandering mind.  At all times seeing and hearing are normal.  There are no further details.  One does not, furthermore, close the eyes or shut the ears; as long as feelings do not stick to things, that will do. ^(Guishan) To have a mind that is neither stilled nor disturbed in the presence of all things in the environment, neither concentrated nor distracted, passing through all sound and form without lingering or obstruction, is called being a wayfarer. ^(Baizhang) If you were able to put a stop to the mind that is running after something with every thought, then you would be no different from a Chan master or a Buddha. ^(Linji) What is called desire and aversion when one is not yet enlightened, not yet liberated, is called enlightened wisdom after enlightenment.  That is why it is said that one is not different from the person one was before, only one’s course of action is different from before. ^(Baizhang) When you are neither immersed nor removed, neither dwelling nor clinging, free and independent, then nothing is not a site of enlightenment. ^(Huangbo) &#x200B; >Coin: Note that Zen does not revolve around reaching a magical state. To begin with, it is more useful to think of it as a return to uncontrived 'normality', stopping the momentum of delusion that affects our daily lives to varying degrees. 'Clear eyes' is a beautiful term. Ultimately, even this is an ideal to dissolve. &#x200B; # Why are people generally not like this? It is just because people themselves create vain and arbitrary attachments that they produce so many kinds of interpretation, conceive so many kinds of opinion, and give rise to so many various cravings and fears. Just understand that things don’t happen on their own; they all come about from one’s own mental impulse of imagination mistakenly clinging to appearances.  If you know that mind and objects fundamentally do not contact each other, you will be set free on the spot.  Everything is in a state of peace right where it is; this very place is the site of enlightenment. ^(Baizhang) &#x200B; >Coin: We are doing the deluding to ourselves, so we are the only authority to undo this. This is why seeking for help externally is a waste of time, why one of the major hurdles to zen study is independent responsibility. This is where great strength and clarity is needed. Look at people you meet in your every day life, do you see their distractions, motivations, opinions, their artificiality? We often think we are better, but likely we are just different in our afflictions. Try to see yourself clearly first, see what there is to work with. &#x200B; # Are there clear instructions to be more like this? If you just harbor no thought of concern with anything at all, existent, nonexistent, or otherwise, you will in time have your share of ease and clarity. Just don’t touch fire, and it won’t burn you.  Right now, just have none of the ten states of impure mind—greedy mind, lustful mind, defiled mind, angry mind, clinging mind, dwelling mind, dependent mind, attached mind, grasping mind, longing mind.  For each of these states there are the three stages—detachment, not dwelling on detachment, not being conscious of not dwelling.  Then all your awareness and activity, transcendent or conventional, all movement and action, speech, silence, crying and laughing, are all enlightened wisdom. First stop focusing on objects; set aside all concerns.  Don’t bring anything to mind, whether good or bad, mundane or transcendental—do not engage in thoughts.  Let go of body and mind; set them free.  With mind like wood or stone, not talking about anything, not ruminating on anything, the ground of mind becomes like space, wherein the sun of wisdom naturally appears.  It is as though the clouds had opened and the sun emerged. Just put an end to all bondage to objects, and feelings of greed, hostility, craving, defilement, and purity all come to an end.  Unmoved in the face of desires and influences, not choked up by what is seen, heard, noticed, or perceived, not confused by anything, naturally endowed with all virtues and the inconceivable use of all spiritual powers, this is someone who is free. Unmoved yet not meditating—this is the meditation of those who arrive at truth as is.  It has nothing to with producing perceptions in meditation. Once affirmation and negation, like and dislike, approval and disapproval, all various opinions and feelings, come to an end and cannot bind you, then you are free wherever you may be. ^(Baizhang) You do not need paraphernalia, practices, or realizations to attain it—what you need to do is clean out the influences of the psychological afflictions connected with the external world that have been accumulating in your psyche since beginningless time.  Make your mind as wide open as cosmic space; detach from holdings in the conceptual consciousness, and false ideas and imaginings will also be like empty space.  Then this effortless subtle mind will naturally be unimpeded wherever it turns. ^(Dahui) It is important that you seek real true perception and understanding, so you can be free in the world and not confused by ordinary spiritualists. It is best to have no obsessions.  Just don’t be contrived; simply be normal. ^(Linji) &#x200B; >Coin: This is straightforward advice. Everyone can understand it. It is just very difficult work, so we tend to move on and look for something else, depending on our disposition, we may want an easier way, or a more esoteric route, or mindless chants, or physical activities to follow - wasting our time. The beauty of a true Zen community is that it cleanses itself of falling into delusional comfort. &#x200B; # What is this 'seeking' paradox? A Buddha is one who does not seek; seek this and you turn away.  The principle is the principle of not seeking; seek it and you lose it.  If you cling to not seeking, this is still the same as seeking.  If you cling to inaction, this is the same as action. ^(Baizhang) &#x200B; >Coin: Just don't seek with desperation, making this your way of life. Of course there is a broader vision to hold when studying Zen, however, like that girl or boy you like, pursuing them too hard at the expense of all measure makes them run away, and your burning desire had the opposite effect. Be cool about it. &#x200B; # How do I use Zen cases and lectures to my benefit? In reading scriptures and studying the teachings, you should turn all words right around and apply them to yourself.  But all verbal teachings only point to the inherent nature of the present mirror awareness—as long as this is not affected by any objects, existent or nonexistent, it is your guide; it can see through all realms, existent or nonexistent. If you prize a particular doctrine, you are deluded by that doctrine; if you esteem a doctrine, you are confused by it.  Believe, and you are deluded by belief.  Disbelief to amounts to slander.  Do not value, do not devalue; do not believe, do not disbelieve. If you say there are some particular verbal expressions to teach people, or that there is some particular doctrine to give people, this is called heresy and destructive suggestion. ^(Baizhang) &#x200B; >Coin: Written teachings are often likened to medicine, and just like medicine differs depending on the patient and illness, the written teachings differ. Sometimes they say the complete opposite, because two students have opposite misconceptions. Some need to be made to follow a Buddha ideal to start listening and internalising, others are so infatuated that their Buddha ideal needs to get its head washed in a toilet bowl. There is nothing real in these teachings, just sign posts, reality is where you stand. When we see this, it becomes easier to work from our own perspective. &#x200B; # What is it with all these heated Zen arguments? Sengzhao said, “Words are like a target inviting an arrow.”  Since talk is like a target, it is impossible to avoid injury.  Since the trouble involved is the same, how can the adept and the naïve be distinguished? Answer:  Just shoot back an arrow to stop the other on the way.  If they miss each other, there is bound to be some injury sustained. ^(Baizhang) &#x200B; >Coin: There is no Zen passport to be issued, we need to keep each other vigilant. All you can do is show yourself. If someone sends an arrow your way and you see it, split it with your own arrow with a wink. If you see someone go down a strange path, shoot an arrow to see what's up. If they get hit and cry about it, help them if you feel like it. Or not. No obligations. If you get hit by an arrow and catch yourself whining about it - what a great opportunity to learn. &#x200B; &#x200B; Archers ready?

ji6v6z,"Yuanwu says: *""People practicing the Way are like chickens incubating eggs; the warmth must be continuous for them to develop.  If there is any interruption in the warmth, they’ll never hatch, even in ten years of incubation. ""* Longya also said: *“Practicing the Way is like drilling for fire; when you see smoke, you still can’t stop. Only when a flame appears and starts burning do you succeed.”* &#x200B; Maintaining accurate awareness around the clock is hard work.

ktulih,"This after years of overthinking and overanalyzing. I might be completely wrong of course in which case I beseech this wonderful community to tear me down and destroy my understanding as usual. A lot has happened in the last few days. I got disillusioned by Buddhism when I realised that most Buddhists don't consider enlightenment their primary goal and instead pour all their energy into religious morality to ensure better karma and rebirth in a heavenly realm. Furthermore, they consider Buddha to be a God, or more precisely, an omniscient being that's above conceptions of Gods. Yuck! Coming from a secular perspective this aspect of Buddhism completely passed over my head and I assumed everybody was striving to become enlightened, given how you know, the Buddha keeps talking about the path that leads you to enlightenment. Turns out they all want to continue existing as they know it, just in better circumstances like heaven. Anyway, rant over. I read a bunch of zen books before and many loans, listened to the Knot Zen podcast for months etc. The problem is, y'all are so damn cryptic! Until someone said a turning phrase (sentence?) in this forum that made something click and made understanding koans so much easier. It read: ""Everything you think about is a concept created by you."" Now, I knew ZMs keep talking about letting go of conceptual thinking, that as soon as you think likes and dislikes, good and bad, you create a dualistic distance akin to the distance of heaven and earth, but I could never quite figure out exactly _how_ to approach this. Until I read this simple sentence that elicited an emotional response from me, that being _the layer of conceptual thinking I put on top of reality is not real_. This was enough for me to let go of conceptual thinking in that instant and finally, for probably the first time in my life, truly be present in life without the added noise. You know, the same thing Buddhists and meditators try to do all the time by vipassana noting mindfulness, and other meditative self-flagellation practices, ones I've tried to do, and been unsuccessful doing, for many years too. The basic difference was that by understanding how things really are, it was not difficult to turn away from conceptual thinking, in fact it was quite easy. So to describe my current understanding of Zen, it's **experiencing life as it truly is without the pollution of conceptual layers of thoughts** This makes many Zen phrases and stories make perfect sense. Starting from the dude that got enlightened hearing the drops of rain all the way to the dude saying kill the Buddha and the patriarchs. The koans being a finger pointing at the moon but not the moon and so on. Of course I don't claim enlightenment thanks to ZMs' fetish with sounding mystical and poetic so I have no true reference point. I'm also back to dualistic thinking as this post clearly demonstrates. I can now just easily turn away from it if I wish to do so. Where is my fault?",There is no fault in shedding old layers of understanding and noticing new ones. The fault would only exist if one saw the new layer as “truth” or “the way” more so than the last one or another one.  Enjoy the process of discovery and seek always to minimize your urge to “understand” the new layer and simply experience it.,37

l0iim,"Ryokan, a Zen master, lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut at the foot of a mountain. One evening a thief visited the hut only to discover there was nothing in it to steal.  Ryokan returned and caught him. ""You may have come a long way to visit me,"" he told the prowler, ""and you shoud not return emptyhanded. Please take my clothes as a gift.""

Can you just tell me what’s going on?” “Well you see,” Roshi replied, “for most people, and especially for most educated people like you and I, what we perceive and experience is heavily mediated, through language and concepts that are deeply ingrained in our ways of thinking and feeling. Our objective here is to induce in ourselves and in each other a psychological state that involves the unmediated experience of the world, because we believe that that state has certain desirable properties. It’s impossible in general to reach that state through any particular form or method, since forms and methods are themselves examples of the mediators that we are trying to avoid. So we employ a variety of ad hoc means, some linguistic like koans and some non-linguistic like zazen, in hopes that for any given student one or more of our methods will, in whatever way, engender the condition of non-mediated experience that is our goal. And since even thinking in terms of mediators and goals tends to reinforce our undesirable dependency on concepts, we actively discourage exactly this kind of analytical discourse.” And the student was enlightened.",33

llxqir,"**Foyan's Instant Zen: Equality** IF YOU TALK about equality, nothing surpasses Buddhism. Buddhism alone is most egalitarian. If one says, ""I understand, you do not,"" this is not Buddhism. If one says, ""You understand, I do not, "" This is not Buddhism either. In the Teachings it says, ""This truth is universally equal, without high or low — this is called unexcelled enlightenment."" My perception is equal to yours, and your perception is equal to mine. And yet, an ancient also said, ""I know everything others know, but others do not know what I know."" Why don't they know? Because they harbor ""high and low"" in their minds, and do not rely on enlightened insight; thus they see this world full of all sorts of crap. What the Sage taught is an egalitarian teaching; he said, ""I get all types of beings to enter nirvana without remainder, whereby I liberate them. I have liberated countless sentient beings in this way, yet there are really no beings who attain liberation."" Is this not an egalitarian teaching? An ancient said, ""Nirvana is called universal liberation; it takes all in uniformly, without remainder; no matter what type of being, empty or existent, sinking or floating. The supernal being can descend to live on earth; the way of enlightenment is inherently omnipresent. If suddenly the slightest thing is there, one lingers forever on this shore."" If there is the slightest leftover, that is ""this shore"", the mundane. It is also said, ""In an instant one flows into ideation, which constitutes the root of birth and death."" How can you have random realizations and arbitrarily produce intellectual interpretations? In ancient times, there was an adept who told people, ""Each of you has your inspiration; when you first determined to go journeying, you must have made this determination on account of life and death. Some may have aroused the determination to avoid misery, or because of the pressure of circumstances; in any case it is called inspiration. Why? To get people to look at their initial inspiration."" That is, if your original thought of inspiration has not changed, turning back to it is most powerful. This is the Zen for you to study; if you actually attain it, it is simply clear purity of mind. When you seek out teachers along the way and contemplate day and night, you are simply nurturing this mind. Then when you have awakened and realized it, you will then see that it had not been lost even before you were inspired. The saint Ashvaghosha said of this, ""Initial enlightenment is itself fundamental enlightenment; fundamental enlightenment itself is unconscious. The nonduality of the initial experience and the fundamental reality is called ultimate enlightenment."" It is also said, ""At the time of initial inspiration one attains true enlightenment,"" meaning first realize the fruit, and the six perfections and myriad deeds of Buddhas are a matter of ripening. This is why I have you just investigate the initially inspired mind. And my perception is one with yours; why not understand in this way? \------------------------ There are folks who come into this forum claiming special insight - some authority to tell other people what they understand correctly and what they do not understand correctly. We might think initially that this is not in line with what Foyan mentions above - 'If one says, ""I understand, you do not,"" this is not Buddhism'... But then, like Foyan, we find ourselves in a tough spot - we are now in the hypocritical position of telling them that they're contradicting Foyan and in fact do not understand, while we do. So what to do about these folks who would use Foyan's words against him, and against the forum? This is the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance): ""If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them."" Foyan sets the example here. He declares that those who come into this forum claiming that they understand and that others do not are in fact wrong. These folks are easy to spot - they're the ones who think their perception is not equal the perception of others, the ones that think their 'special insight' means there is a special set of rules that apply to them and not to others. This is not equality. And it is not insight - we've all read what Zen masters have to say about 'delusion' and 'enlightenment'. >""No DELUSION, NO ENLIGHTENMENT"" — only when you have arrived at such a state are you comfortable and saving energy to the maximum degree. But this is simply being someone without delusion or enlightenment; what is there deluding you twenty-four hours a day? You must apply this to yourself and determine on your own.   >   >All realms of existence are there because of the deluded mind; right now, how could they not be there? Once you realize they are not there, they cannot delude your feelings and certainly cannot do anything to you. It is necessary to attain the reality where there is no delusion and no enlightenment before you can become free and unfettered. Here's a similar trap: what would you call attaining this reality where there is no delusion and no enlightenment? Is that enlightenment? Where there is no delusion and no enlightenment, is there real and unreal? I'll leave you with an absolute kicker from Foyan: >Think about it independently. Other people do not know what you are doing all the time; you reflect on your own—are you in harmony with truth or not? Here you cannot be mistaken; investigate all the way through. Are you in harmony with truth or not?","This is some great Foyan and great commentary. So much of the same from him is posted here, so this is refreshing.   I’m pretty well versed in Theravada, and the more I dig into those suttas, the more I’m convinced the Zen guys were saying the same thing the Buddha was, just from maybe a deeper and less systematic level.

lo4isd,"It seems to me that some here have probably trapped themselves into an intellectual understanding of Zen, so I will make one observation that I believe might help. If your everyday, ordinary mind still has a feeling of *subject* and *object*, you probably need to work on that. (e.g., ""I [subject] see the (oak, ash, juniper, what?) tree [object] in the courtyard"") To quote the Xinxin Ming: ""The subject disappears with its object, The object vanishes without its subject. Objects are objects because of subjects, Subjects are subjects because of objects. Know that these two Are essentially of one emptiness. The one emptiness unites opposites, Equally pervading all phenomena."" What is ""every minute Zen""? What is abiding in the Unborn? What is it that the 5th patriarch says of, in the Platform Sutra, that you cannot lose sight of, even in battle? It is certainly *not any kind of intellectual understanding*. Can you lose sight of your Zen *in battle*? Can you *forget* the *key idea* underlying your Zen in battle, and thereby not have your Zen? Just a vibe here sometimes. It's hard to know anyone's state of mind and where they're coming from, but I do feel an undercurrent of intellectual understand standing in where you need not-intellectual understanding. EDIT 2: Also, consider the line: ""The duality of all things comes from false discrimination."" I [subject] vs tree [object]--duality, or false discrimination. And if it's to be more than words on a page, more than intellectual understanding, if it means anything, it must mean that--no duality between that I and that tree--that's false discrimination.","Trapped?  Pretty sure a lot of people are just sitting there, with zero interest in leaving.  No trap needed.",18
m00fis,"Alright folks, time to take the stage. What I mean is, this: There has been a lot of nonsense in here lately. Like... a lot. Even by r/zen standards.  And... I do get it: your civilization is both visibly and tangibly collapsing around you, and you don't know what else to do other than come to r/zen and add your voice to the generalized ruckus. It is a tried and true response to chaos, disorder, collapse, fear, and society-wide low-dharma tides. No one here, least of all myself, expects anyone to bring any voice other than the one they currently have. That's to be expected, and is certainly not a problem. So, despite the aesthic hit my favorite community here on r/zen has taken as a consequence, I welcome all of you who are fleeing rebellion and destituition, war and strife, hatred and enmity, sorrow, loss, collective insanity, violence, oppression, persecution, famine, plague—and all the other generally unpleasant things of low aesthetic quality and experience that are out and about in the world these days—and who coming here in an attempt to carve out a space for yourself in this place, which can provide both a bastion and bulwark against these trepidations and depredations of self and personal liberation. I've gotten rather hopped-up myself due to these changes, which I think means it's finally time to make an OP.  I've been holding back, you see. My own life has been at a nadir, an extreme nadir, for several months. I'm physically ill in a way that is worrying. I have been plum out of resources for as long as I can remember. Winter has been harsh, and long.  And, on top of all of this... r/zen has sucked.  I hate to put it like this, but it's true: it has sucked lately. Usually this is the place one goes to for reliable conversation, Zen study, discussion, friendship, energy, high-quality creative content, and laughter. Instead it has become something of a gauntlet for a student of Zen—first in the low quality of posts, post titles, literary aesthetic, discussion, invective, and general miasma of pandemic and emotional foundering. Add to that the personal attacks myself and others have had to suffer at the hands of a small number of aggressive trolls—and there is really no other way to put it: the place has been inundated with poison at a rate faster than it can heal itself of poison... at least for a moment. But perhaps we can change that over the next few months. (I certainly hope so...mortality seems to be knocking me pretty hard about the ears these days.) As a first step in this direction, I have filmed an 'introduction to Linseed's new home' video to share with you all. It is quite fun. I have turned my own cabin into a stage that can be shared with all of you here in r/zen... friends and perceived enemies alike. It means a lot to me, to invite you all into my home. I have found the perfect stage, and have put a lot of effort into becoming a performer on this stage—basically for no other reason than that I would like to invite my real true friends over for tea (all of you here on r/zen), and have a laugh together. I'll continue doing this for as long as I'm able, which is hopefully a long time, but possibly a short one. So what I've done is this: I've put most of the entertainment into the video. I go off quite at length about all sorts of the nonsense that has been flying around in here. I don't hold back. I think most of you who don't study Chinese literature extensively are silly, when it comes down to it—and I also want you to learn see yourselves this way. I can't see how it wouldn't help, honestly! In my opinion, ya'll could use a little more chinese literature, a little more hermit, and a little more nature in your lives. (Not to mention stagecraft!) Anyway, it's almost an hour in length, and I hope you find it a hoot. I'll link it at the bottom. More importantly, by placing the shenanigans safely into the contents of this video gift-box, I can throw all that stuff away and focus on a couple of questions for the community that I think are far more interesting than religious squabbles, literary trifles or—in my case at leasr—[truffles](https://i.imgur.com/cmXyNuR.jpg), emotive squalling, disjointed invective, and the neverendeing cacophany of sticks being applied indiscriminately to the pates of monks. Now, to the quotes, which are all taken from case 670 in Dahui's *Treasury of the Eye of True Teaching, Volume II*, translated by Thomas Cleary.  (I highly recommend a complete reading of this very long case. It's a great one for current circumstances in r/zen, I find—but far too long to examine in its entirety in one OP.) ___ First Quote: >	If you are determined to succeed to the way of this school, it is necessary for mind and environment to be as one before you have a little bit of accord.  Hearing me say something like this, don’t immediately close your eyes and play dead, forcibly arranging your mind to be at one with the environment.  In this, no matter how you try, how can you arrange it?  Do you want to attain genuine unity of mind and environment?  You just need to make a complete break and resolute cutoff, take away what forms false imagination in your skull, cut off the eighth consciousness in one sword stroke, naturally, not applying arrangement. I read these passages much more literally than some others in this forum seem to, and I wonder why this is. I take the ""necessity for mind and environment to be as one before you have a little bit of accord"" very seriously. What does this mean to you? To me, it means that my environment is my mind. I interact with it as mind. My body is merely my self at the center of this mind. Everything is always ordinary from there. When a bird lands on a tree outside my window, this is a manifestion of mind. When a pygmy owl hoots, this is mind. When the moon charts her course through the sky, at night, and sheds her moonlight successively through each of my cabin windows, flooding the walls and floor of my stage, bathing my own self like a lunar gnomon, somehow already placed exactly where it needs to be—this is all mind. At the center is my body. My body knows how to act within its own mind. I barely have to do anything at all—yet everything gets done, everything happens, and there is never any end to the happenings and doings, never an end or bottom to the self that continuously manifests as a reaction to the environment of mind.  See the video below for an example, perhaps. When environment and mind are one, in my experience, accord is reached—and there is never an end to expression. Is it this way for others? Have you broken through into such a state? If not, why do you continue to argue, to study doctrine, to sling sayings and phrases? Would it not be better to first breakthrough, and then, only afterward, to embrace the neverending eloquence, the flow of quote after quote, the river of living words and expressions that produce themselves without cessation once envirnment and mind are as one? What is the purpose of your useless chatter before this moment of breaking through? The words that arrive are dead on appearance. They feel dead, they talk like death, and they choke like death.  What is your experience with mind and evironment being as one? *I'm asking.* ___ Second quote: >	Equanimity means equanimous toward good and bad, equanimous toward turning away and turning to, equanimous toward principle and phenomena, equanimous toward ordinary and holy, equanimous toward the finite and the infinite, equanimous toward substance and function.  This principle is only known to those who realize it experientially.  If you haven’t realized experientially, you simply must get experiential realization.  Only when you’re attained experiential realization can you be called real home leavers.  If your mind does not experience realization and you grasp realization outside of mind, this is called an outsider who has left home; you are not fit to be a monk. Have you attained ""experiential realization""? What do you think this means? Why do you think anything else matters? ___ Third Quote: >	There’s also another kind—‘It’s not in words, it’s not in the cases of the ancients, it’s not in the nature of mind, it’s not in mystic subtlety, it’s not in being or nonbeing, gain or loss.  It’s like fire—touch it, and you get burned.  It is not standing apart from reality—right where you are is reality.  Taking up what comes to hand, you transcend present and past.  One statement comes, one statement goes—in the end one statement is left over—this is getting the advantage.’  People like this are just playing with the mass of ignorance of conditioned consciousness; so they say there is no cause and effect, no consequences, and no person and no Buddha, that drinking alcohol and eating meat do not hinder enlightenment, that theft and lechery do not inhibit wisdom.  Followers like this are indeed insects on the body of a lion, consuming the lion’s flesh.  This is what Yongjia called “Opening up to emptiness denying cause and effect, crude and unrestrained, bringing on disaster.” Are you merely playing with the 'mass of ignorance of conditioned consciousness'? What do you think of eating meat? Do you eat meat? I find this a more interesting question than most of the ones brought forward in doctrinal disputes or discussions. I'm not telling you to eat meat or not, I'm asking you if you do and what you think of it. What is its relevance to the study of Zen, to you?  From this passage it sounds like Dahui thinks its pretty clear that meat and alcohol 'hinder enlightenment.' What do you think of this? How about 'theft and lechery'? Are you nothing but an insect on the body of a lion, consuming its flesh? Do you deny cause and effect? Unrestrained? Bringing on disaster?  I ask myself these questions frequently. Do you? Do those who attack users in this forum, insult them and criticize their pursuit of Zen, claim that nothing matters, that nothing is Zen, that anything is Zen, that 'breaking through' is irrevelant, or unreal, or a mere metaphor, or just something ""some guy on the internet"" is talking about, have anything to say to the lion whose flesh sustains them? Of course not. It is their own lion, yet they choose to ignore its existence.  Better a liontamer with a chair, and a whip for self, than insects feasting on the noble body. ___ Closing comments: There is a rising tide of hate speech being brought into this forum, and I suppose there is nothing to do about it since this is America, other than to call it out while pointing to both the reddiquette and the First Amendment. I recently came under attack by a rather vicious troll. He has levelled gender-, sexuality-, and neurodiversity-based hatespeech and attacks against several members of this forum, both in this forum and in satellite communities. I am an autistic person who has been losing both my ability to verbalize and my memory for almost a decade. I have trained and practiced with constant dedication so that I am able to communicate, and moreover so that I am able to share my self and experiences with my friends using my literary talents. It has been a wildly successful endeavor. I have not only salvaged a mind, but have in fact managed to constuct one—through massive effort—that is capabale of literary communication and expression at a level of manifestion that I had never bothered to even hope for.  It's what allows me to communicate with my friends both in real life and here in r/zen.  It is what allows me to make literary contributions to this community and the study of Zen and Chinese literature generally. It is the expression of mind and environment truly being as one. I don't care if you see it that way. I don't have to be afraid of Nazis or care what they think. What is fear? Nazis are idiots. They call me invalid because of how I speak when I keep it to snippets—yet when I sit down and share some real thoughts they are incapable of reading it, let alone responding. Not hard to identify people who just want to get rid of you, silencing a voice they fear and can't understand.  So phooey on them.  But to all other trolls—welcome, welcome! I look forward to many and fruitful discussions! I literally never run out of energy for that shit, somehow. ___ In closing, before linking my video, here is a quote from Shakespeare's *As You Like It*, I sincerely hope you can appreciate the drift: >	[Jaques](https://i.imgur.com/3KZK9jy.jpg) >	All the world’s a stage,   And all the men and women merely players;   They have their exits and their entrances,   And one man in his time plays many parts,   His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,   Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.   Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel   And shining morning face, creeping like snail   Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,   Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad   Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,   Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,   Jealous in honor, sudden, and quick in quarrel,   Seeking the bubble reputation   Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,   In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,   With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,   Full of wise saws and modern instances;   And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts   Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,   With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,   His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide   For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,   Turning again toward childish treble, pipes   And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,   That ends this strange eventful history,   Is second childishness, and mere oblivion,   Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.   ___ Well, I guess I'm a little [peter'd](https://i.imgur.com/PvQkj9i.jpg) out by this point.  So might as well pick up sticks: [Linseed Takes a Stage](https://vimeo.com/519653746) Hope you enjoy the show, —Linseed","So for now, I've just watched the first minute of the video. Your place looks rad. I don't know what your life has been like. But I am so deeply cheered every time I see someone actually DOING the things I fantasize about doing. I'm autistic too. You had kinda pinged my radar, I hope you don't mind me saying. I'm curious about how you've found autism interfaces with Zen. For me, it's been a real eye opener as a way to practice communication. Just the bare fact of ""the more you talk, the wronger you are.""* >If your mind does not experience realization and you grasp realization outside of mind, this is called an outsider who has left home; you are not fit to be a monk.

m2gv0v,">Someone asked Master Yunmen, ""What is most urgent for me?"" >The Master said, ""The very you who is afraid that he doesn't know!"" -Zen Master Yunmen . Here we go. I'm sure a lot of people here have experienced a very particular phenomenon that, for the most part, hasn't received a designation (although, one user notified me that ewk has been accused of this as much as [7 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/wiki/words)). I am choosing to call it **Intellectual Quicksand** for the way certain kinds of conversations on r/Zen do not follow any kind of reasonable consistency. It is mostly experienced in the way certain ideas are pushed to the forefront of the conversation, while others are denigrated and actively silenced. If someone points out the ideational incoherence, they are often ""called out"" in a way that is meant to antagonize and be systematic in approach. This is often held up as a ""gold standard"" that Zen Masters allegedly used, and users openly congratulate eachother on their ability to do so. Users who go against the grain are trolls themselves, or are implicated by others as not having done their part in managing the ""troll problem"", so I suppose those towing the line are the Bodhisattvas. Below are numerous examples, of which more I am sure could be added: -Adherents focus a lot on the sections of the corpus that elucidate the voidness (often misunderstood as emptiness) of cleanliness and impurity while devoting obscene hours to ""cleaning up"" the subreddit by regularly posting and commenting about ""trolls who want to slide the conversation away from Zen"" in a way that makes no reference to anything Zen Masters have said. -Posts are expected to be one's own commentary with quotes from a Zen Master, while those who demand this standard rarely include more than a vague question in their post, unless they are ranting again about trolls. -Those who post quotes with topics unrelated to Zen are, in fact, topic sliding, unless the ""topical discussion"" is a diatribe about ""trolls"". -Any discussion of the topicality of ""unapproved/taboo"" topics such as the four noble truths, meditation, sutras, or Zen ""outside"" the Hongchou school will often be met with analogical false equivalence of discussing Scientology or Mormonism in a Christian forum, but any discussion of the ""failings"" of these topics is ""topical"" to a Zen forum, even if any unbiased individual would likely see topic-sliding and intellectual quicksand in these discussions. -Anyone who wishes to discuss ""taboo"" subjects is accused of ""religious bigotry"", while even the mention of Dogen or a dozen other Masters is met with attempts to halt and undermine conversation. This includes talking about the Sutras Zen Masters continually reference when teaching, discussion of which is labelled ""hate-speech"". -Carl Bielefeldt is pulled out over and over again as evidence of discrepancies in Dogen's history, while almost any other academic can be said to be either uneducated or a ""dishonest religious shill."" -Lineage is never important, such as the questionable lineage of Bodhidharma, or lack of with Bankei, until lineage becomes one of the central arguments invalidating other teachers, such as Dogen. -All talk of practice is rejected, often specifically citing Huangbo, while the fact that most of *Transmission of Mind* is about the practice of ""The Way"" of cutting of interpretations is sidestepped, as is all the cases that advocate for a similar practice or the myriad references to ""refinement"" or admiration of virtue etc. -All translations are acceptable and can clearly demonstrate what the original author intended without bias, unless the translater is a known follower of a religion, in which case there is nothing credible about the translation. -*Huatou* is held up as an example of perverted Zen, while Dahui, the primary proponent of *huatou*, as evidenced in his letters, is continually cited from his 600+ cases with commentary. -Personal interpretations are encouraged, unless they include ideas that are not ""approved"", and then are said not to be personal, but inherited from a ""perverted"" form of Zen. -Quoting ""approved"" Zen Masters is held up as the Golden Standard, but often claims are made without quoting anyone, and often quotes that are used appropriately are still rejected. -At any moment an appropriate text can be said to be plagiarized and rewritten by ""religious zealots"", even if written by an ""acceptable"" Zen Master, while every text that exists in the Hongchou school and it's immediate Tang and Song China successors has survived intact without ""perversion."" -Dogen, and often other users, when reading and interpreting the Zen Masters is an act of fraud, while every Zen Master that succeeded the Hongchou school up to Dogen is original and legitimate, as is Bankei. -The only thing that can tie these incongruencies together and straighten them out is if there are ideas that underlie what the Zen Masters spoke about, also known sometimes as ""nests"", which paradoxically is a term that is used to invalidate any ideas people bring to the table about Zen. . All in all, what this means is there are a number of people in r/Zen who will go to great lengths to ensure that their views come out on top of the discussion, because they have set up intricate psychological defenses against the consideration of opposing viewpoints. And who would want to do that? They read all the promises of magical, ""instant"" enlightenment so seriously, and believed with all their hearts that with their special *mental key*, the entire corpus would suddenly open up to them, and they would forever understand everything said by the ""real"" Zen Masters, and would never have a moment of doubt about the **Truth**^™️ and its reality transcending superpowers. This, all from the obviously understood, but ignored, fact that the only Zen Master to ever claim understanding after reading a few Chinese texts for a year or two was Dogen. But, so what? They will never have to look unknowledgeable again!  Bro, don't you know reality is made up? Suffering? Cleaning? Effort? Sorry bro, my mental faculties have defeated all that. Don't you know I can just stop dualism?","There was a reddit comment or blog post or something once ... I just tried to search for it, and can't find it, and I'm sure it worded it much better than I will... but it outlined points something like: 1. 99% of people on the internet are silent. The 1% who talk are weird. They are probably not normal and do not have normal views. If nothing else, they're not a random sample of the population *or* a population of experts. There is something weird about the sample. 2. Within the talking 1%, there's the usual power-law kind of curve, where you have a few super-talkers/people who push their views superhard 3. they're usually not experts in their field, but random internet people, often obsessed with imaginary points. they often have strange, often demonstrably incorrect views, and 4. they quite likely are not very mentally balanced, and 5. nonetheless, they have an outsized effect on what we see, hear, think, etc. with their very bad and probably not mentally balanced opinion. You are probably getting strange, unbalanced views from unknowledgable people of questionable mental health. It's an enlightening perspective. You just can't take people talking on the internet too seriously. For the downvoters: You're downvoting strange views from a person of questionable mental health after internet points, aren't you? THERE'S NO ESCAPE",45

We're taught that we are broken and need fixing. We're taught to bow down to authority.

mawbzu,"I am done with all this studying Zen that has been going on in the sub. Understanding this shit is so easy and it's boring to see the same names and cases repeated over and over. I just wanna see some good old fashioned r/zen drama in peace, and you guys keep ruining it with your stupid questions about Zen.  I hoped you guys would get it on your own, but I can't take this bullshit anymore, so I'm gonna break it down for you. If you read this post, that's it, you are enlightened and can't keep hanging around this sub wanting to learn. You WILL stay here, though, and you WILL contribute to the drama. Ready? Great.  You have NOTHING to do,  just attend to the circumstances of your life. Why look for something outside?  The treasure is who you are.  What does this shit have to do with Zen? I JUST FUCKING TOLD YOU. This is Zen. Are you trying to become something else by sitting or studying or arguing about cases? It's not going to work. Ever. Everything you are is already there. Just trust it. You will never gain anything by doing all this crap, nor do you lose anything by not doing it.  But okay, okay, you want some quotes from Zen Masters because that's the only way to get a topical post around here. Here you go, from Dahui: >Even sameness’ means good and evil are equal, turning away and turning towards are equal, inner truth and outer events are equal, ordinary and sage are equal, finite and infinite are equal, essence and function are equal. This truth can only be known by those who experience it. All of you people who haven’t yet experienced it simply must do so. Only when you’ve experienced it completely can you be called a true leaver of home. Those whose minds don’t experience this, and who seek the experience outside of mind, are called homeleaving outsiders: they’re not fit to plant weeds. What this means is, stop making stupid distinctions about stuff that doesn't matter. Are you eating? are you drinking water? Jesus Christ please let some sunlight hit you and stop obsessing about what a true insight is. And I know, I know, you need time to get it, you are gonna be wrong and then you are gonna hit on something that's gonna make you understand. So please hurry up, so I don't have to read your lame OPs about every little realization you have. Drama over Dharma, amiright? And remember this:  You are okay, keep searching.

Back then, I thought: I’m surely the *”it’s all empty”* kinda guy. Today, I don’t take a side. Now, though this case showcases two Zen Masters, one answering in the affirmative and one in the negative, Zen Masters are known to dance between the dualistic nature of linguistics in their conversations. What’s important to note, when they do so, is: *For what reason?* Trolls and wannabe gurus come here and purposely twist conversation, suddenly exclaiming “your argument doesn’t work, cause nothing exist.” They jump from affirmative to negative, only to try and win a battle, when in fact *direct truth* and *seeing your nature* is what Zen Masters are on about. Wannabe Gurus fail to understand this, hence why Joshu reminded: *“When a false person expounds a true doctrine, the true doctrine accordingly becomes false.”* Don’t play that false game, if you’re really, actually here to study Zen.","I always come back to stuff like  > *The fundamental Dharma is that of no-Dharma* > Mumon's comment of *If you say yes or no, you lose your very own buddha nature* > *Above, below, and all around you, all is spontaneously existing.

Anything that we then perceive to exist is *conventional* existence.  >Now, though this case showcases two Zen Masters, one answering in the affirmative and one in the negative, Zen Masters are known to dance between the dualistic nature of linguistics in their conversations. I think they have the dance because the fundamental teaching is beyond affirmation and negation. They only have to affirm or deny because the question put forth before them.  If there's no question, where's the answer?

nb2ccp,"Suddenly becoming aware of your true nature won't cause you to walk around in an irreversible, 24/7 state of awareness where you can never again become attached to concepts and desires. Attachments to concepts and desires can and will happen, but true nature is always there and every moment is chance come back to ""seeing"" it. The claims that some people here make that no **true** Zen master could ever possibly engage is sexual misdeeds is to make enlightment into some supernatural woo woo bullshit.","That's not really what ""enlightenment"" is about, and I agree with you that what you described is an absurd idea. Zen masters aren't some sort of übermensch who have transcended humanity, though, and they're susceptible to buying into ideas and concepts just like anyone else. They just reject those concepts as quickly as they realize them, and zen masters are pretty damn good at seeing them. Why do you think those old fuckers are always trying to trap one another into admitting attachment to an idea? And why do you think they either laugh or get angry when they're caught? They're not immune. I'd cite some examples but I'm taking a shit and on my phone, and they're literally everywhere in zen texts. Just read P'ang laughing about stupid shit and doing silly dances when he gets one over on his old friends. > The claims that some people here make that no *true* Zen master could ever possibly engage is sexual misdeeds I don't know how this is at all related to the first part of your post, but, uh... yeah, I don't think that's what those folks are saying. The old masters aren't walking paragons of virtue or some shit like that. Pretty sure what people take issue with is weaponizing an altered version of what the old masters taught in order to start a church, and then using the power acquired from said church to sex up your followers.",49
nbi4mn,"I never posted here and mostly just lurk occasionally but I this morning I went a bit deeper and seems like there's some really weird stuff going on that dosent make a lot of sense. Constant talk about who is and isn't using drugs, if it matters, some talk about a cult? Also a lot of high horseyness about what or who is or is not Zen all seems very gatekeepy and not zen at all. Honestly seems like things have become somewhat of a dumpster fire here with a few very loud voices drowning everything out.  Can any one explain what is going on? This sub does NOT seem to have any chill rn. EDIT: after some interesting comments I think a few users have started to explain things in a way that makes sense I would change my stance to say less dumpster fire more tough love. Definitely something that's hard to gather without it being pointed out but I think its starting to make sense.",This is how the place has always been. There are other subreddits that are less........this.,60
nj95cc,"It feels like a good percentage of this sub is just people arguing about what zen is. I’ve never seen someone say anything about what zen is without a million people who disagree. People might say you can’t define zen and while that may be completely true it doesn’t help someone who has no idea what it is. It feels like zen is some kind of prank to fuck with people. I’ve heard about people going to zen temples and having to do all these weird things so they would give up on looking for it and then “have it”. Is that what this sub is? If I scroll long enough will I give up on trying to figure it out and then I’ll be without any ideas of the world? Seriously what the fuck is zen UPDATE: Here’s a summary of the replies I’ve gotten: 500,000 page texts that may lead me to “be introduced to zen” but nothing that explains the shitstorm that is this sub Weird questions like “What’s wrong with this sub being this way? Who is it that wants it to be another way? *bangs gong*  Odd vague statements  Someone says something, and a massive thread begins of people fighting each other  “Yes zen is a prank to fuck with people”  And last but not least people saying that this sub is a weird cult that has nothing to do with zen. It seems like that’s the most reasonable answer I’ve gotten so far. That could explain this and I don’t know what else could.",right now the only thing i see on this subreddit is posts asking what’s wrong with the subreddit,46
xy322,"http://i.imgur.com/jqyhw.jpg It's more about trying too hard, I guess. I've always had the vibe from new age oriented schools and thoughts that they are just making things unnecessary complex - this includes many religions, and buddhism too. That the truth can be much simpler. And I believe this man thinks so too.",zen is the most simple belief set out there: it barely has any. how much simpler can it get?,16
y8325,"We have very few submissions, but quite a lot of readers. It's very quiet and zenny in here. If you click on the ""new"" tab, there's rarely anything there! To make a submission here feels almost contra-produductive! We have no links to other schools of Buddhism on the sidebar, yet the others links to us. This suggests a disconnection - the school-less school. We have a lot of people who likes a good time, and messes around with each other. They see the game of life, and do not take it so seriously. This is good. But it makes some people offended. Maybe they should sit down and laugh a little!  Things are rarely downvoted... into oblivion at least, for there is no point. It's not because of a circle-jerk, it's because we are all on our own path, and they are equal. ",deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6321gone94407),21
y9swt,"Posters to r/Zen, please - terse Zen-like sayings are not all that helpful.  We here are not Zen Masters, and we are not students - we are just humans on the path.  Posting seemingly 'elevated' comments might seem cute, but it often comes off as superficial.  I'll admit that I've been guilty of this too. Just posting things like 'make some tea instead' and 'There is nothing to understand. No-gate!' isn't really compassionate.  Right Speech is not 'good' or 'bad' - it is wise, apt, and useful. IMO Thanks for listening...  ","Definitely agree with this. A lot of the ""riddles"" make perfect sense to one who already gets it and doesn't need them, but are useless and even mocking to one who doesn't have a clue and is just beginning. Always consider your audience and the reason for posting - are you just trying to look wise and hold it over them that you know what they don't? Or are you genuinely trying to guide someone to better understanding? Using words may automatically confound things somewhat, but personally I'm willing to take that risk to try to describe things in more colloquial language rather than stating that what is, isn't, or parroting koan-like truisms. What would I have others think of my advancement? I wouldn't... they should just look at what I say and consider if it rings true to them. I didn't originate it; I didn't ""attain"" it so much as it's natural to come to know what I know when in the position I'm in. If possible, it'd be nice to help others get even farther along than myself - it's better for all of us that way. One's understanding and everyone's understanding are not so different - they both feed into one continuum. So keeping others in the dark only reduces one's own chances to understand more fully.",31
