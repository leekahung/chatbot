13ghvd,"**e**: I regret putting ""it made me feel like a pussy"" part in the title. Unnecessary, sorry. -------------------- I've been going to the same gym for 6 months now. I've seen the same guy there pretty much every time I work out (6am), he's usually happy/talking to the local gym goers. However, I haven't seen him in two weeks.      Today was different though. I saw him today, I said hello like usual in the lockers, he threw a half hearted hello, completely blank face.      We were out of the lockers and started warming up for deadlifts. Now, he's a pretty big dude, gym goer for 4 years now (he says). He's deadlifting 600 lbs for 3x5. We're doing our final set, and he loads two 25's on each side, 50lbs is huge to add to such an intense workout. He busts out 15 reps with such unreal intensity, by the 10th rep he had an insane pump going, and thats when the tears started breaking out and streaming down his face. He's grunting/yelling/making sounds (not too loud to disrupt the maybe...3 people in the gym at the time?) by the 10th rep. After the 15th he could barely get the bar up. When he was done he was a complete wreck. Very close to fainting, tears fully on streaming down his face. Red as a tomato, total rage, huffing and puffing. I asked him what was up, he replied in such a shaky/sobby voice: ""She took my kids, my money, my life."" And then proceeded to the lockers to wash up and leave.      Just a story I thought I'd share.     His name is Robert. No his last name is not Paulson god damnit.",Instantly reminded me of this: http://doyouevenlift.tumblr.com/post/31050932469/craigs-story,1907
13kalu,"EDIT:  Never thought I would have received this kind of response. Thanks Fittit for all the congrats and kind words.  I don't pretend to have all answers to fitness, weight loss, triathlon, or strength training, but feel free to hit me up with any questions any time.  I am truly humbled by your comments. Keep pushing fittit and kick some ass.  Thanks Again!  Here's me at 210lb's in Oct 2008.  http://imgur.com/U9ej2 Overall  I was in pretty bad health.  Big drinker/smoker, high blood pressure, couldn't run a city block.   Here's me at 152lb's after finishing IRONMAN Arizona http://imgur.com/oo3Bn The last 4 years were in no way linear and Ironman was never the goal (until last year).  This was my progress... * Jan 2009 Weight loss competition.  Diet: Modified 4hr body.  Routine:mostly cardio with some machine work.  I was working out in a clubhouse gym, so options were limited.  Went from 210-180lb in 3 months.  Quit smoking * June 2009 Join a 24hr gym.  More resistance training, but a pretty BS routine.  Had some strength gains, but also some weight gain as I was still drinking beer daily (8+ easily). Switched from eliptical to treadmill running.   * Feb 2010 First 5k.  33min * March 2010: Join Lifetime Fitness.  Start Spinning 2-3 times/week.  Lifting 6 days week. * Feb 2011 1st 1/2 Marathon  2:0X:XX * May 2011  Find Fittit.  Stop BS'ing in the gym and start lifting. Dropped the curls, calf  raises...etc.., added squats, deadlifts, pullups...all the good stuff fittit has taught me.  * Nov 2011  Sign up for IMAZ 2012.  Stop drinking during the week.  * Dec 2011  Bought road bike  * Feb 2012  First Marathon  3:5X:XX * April 2012  First triathlon. 1/2 Ironman  5:3X:XX * Nov 2012  Ironman Arizona 11:1X:XX * Advice (for what it's worth) * Find a diet with food you like.  I still eat chicken, eggs, and black beans every day.   * Start doing the big compound lifts * Interval training works * You can be an Endurance Athlete on a low carb diet.  I did 75% of my IM training on less than 120 carbs/day.   * Stopping drinking really takes off the pounds.   A sincere thanks to you Fittit.  Couldn't have done it without you.

18w30k,"Hi Reddit! Before we get into the transformation I want to give this message to all those in the transformation process. Transforming yourself on the inside is as important if not more so than making the physical transformation. I'll get into this again later, but for me, my physical transformation was just a catalyst for my later inner transformation. And **it wasn't until I changed the way I perceived myself, the world, and life in general that my life REALLY change.**  You can be the biggest/most ripped guy on the planet, but without a good inner base of confidence you will never feel complete/whole. **My Transformation** * I grew up as a skinny little kid. Didn't pass 100lbs until I was 15. Took weight lifting in High School but wasn't very serious about it. Put on a decent amount of muscle for a High Schooler but I was still skinny as hell. [Here's me at 18 in 2005, about 145-150lbs](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#0) * Went to college and made getting big my NUMBER one goal. Didn't party, didn't socialize, didn't do sh*t but lift and read about lifting and playing MMOs(because I was very socially awkward, unconfident, and felt that if I could get big then I could get girls.) Put on about 20lbs that year, bench went from 205 to 255, didn't do a single squat that year hah. [Here's me at 175lbs in the Summer of 2006](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#1) * From the fall of 2006 to the end of 2008 I took bulking VERY seriously, and I learned more about proper lifting. Primarily followed Madcow's 5x5 program and gained a ton of strength/size. Also gained a ton of fat as I was eating some ridiculous meals to put on size. A typical dinner for me consisted of at least 350g carbs and 16oz of meat. I seriously think I made myself insulin resistant to the point of being border-line type 2 diabetic in this period. At the end of that time I had terrible energy swings, would literally fall unconscious after large dinners. But I gained size! And fat... [Was 215 at the end of 2008](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#2) * I started my cut in the Winter of 2008 and that lasted all the way until the fall of 2009. I tried EVERY diet. 40/40/20, velocity diet(where your only source of calories are from 5 protein shakes a day for 28 days- **terrible, never do this**), carb cycling, keto, high fat, low fat, high carb, low carb. You name it, I tried it. Settled on keto and carb cycling as the most effective for me. Dropped down to 187, lost quite a bit of strength, definitely lost some muscle mass(especially during velocity diet). [Here is me at the end of that cut, fall of 2009](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#4) * Today I am a healthy 195. I've been at this weight for the last two years. This seems to be a good homeostasis point. I like the weight because I can be strong/big and yet still pretty athletic(I'm in the Army so I need to be able to run). [A shot of my legs in Sept 2012.](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#6) [Just for fun, here's a video I just uploaded of doing 102 reps of Squats with 225lbs in 29 minutes.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGUQXxUDxjE) I'm a firm believer that squats and deads are fundamental to developing a well-rounded physique. GO SQUAT! Also for anyone interested, I made a [NASM study guide](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/free-comprehensive-nasm-study-guide-pass-your-cpt/) which could be useful information on learning more in-depth ideas about training. * [A video I made of my transformation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pRDBtgdhoM) * [Link to a more detailed write-up of my transformation](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/2013/02/12/the-transformation-of-a-nerdy-asian-gamer/) Now let me talk about inner change. After I got ""ripped"" in 2009 I realized that life didn't change much. Sure I got more attention from people and girls, but I still felt unconfident. I still sucked with women. I still was shy and timid. **Note- I realize getting girls is not the sole purpose of life, but for someone in their 20's it is still a very important issue- especially if you CAN'T attract the kind of women you want to date, and that's why I keep hitting on that issue.** That's when I really got serious with self development. Read a ton of books and worked on my inner being. A few examples of exercises I did- I would walk around and force myself to hold eye-contact with every person walking by me on campus(insanely difficult at first!). I consciously talked louder. I made myself aware of how my body language was at all times. Little things like that, which over time, really helped me to grow confident in myself. Today I absolutely love life. I love it and I live it with zeal. I've been able to land great jobs because of my confidence and social skills developed over the last few years. I've started my own business that brings in about 1k a month after 8 months. I was able to do this because of the confidence I gained and the realization that anything is possible with disciplined hard work. **So my message to all of you is that you can change EVERYTHING about yourself. You can change your appearance, and you can change your attitude toward life. You can change your limiting beliefs. You can change how people perceive you, and you can change how you perceive life.** And just to put a little plug in, I have built a [website](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/) and [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/HappyJacksChannel) that is dedicated to helping nerdy gamers become fit, active, and confident(because I grew up addicted to UO/EQ/WoW). * [If you're into the whole facebook thing would love to get more like-minded folks active on the facebook page to share ideas/get new ideas/motivate each other.](https://www.facebook.com/thehealthygamerchannel) My passion in life is helping others realize the potential hidden within them. We all have within us the seed of greatness. It is up to you to awaken and nurture that seed until it propels you into the life that you've always known you deserved. Go out there. Take action. Make it happen. Feel free to ask me questions about training/fitness/nutrition/self development/confidence/women/motivation. I'm going to check this thread pretty regularly for the next week and answer all of them. And again guys, if you put hard work into it you can absolutely achieve anything in life. **FAQ** * What exercise regime did I follow? - I followed Madcow 5x5 for most of the period. I now do 5x3x1. I modify both of these by adding in extra sets of hypertrophy specific work at the end of the workout(3-5 sets of an exercise that compliments the major muscle groups worked that day with 10-15 reps).  * What kind of diet do you recommend? - I have tried literally everything. Keto, 40/40/20, carb cycling, high carb, low carb, whole grain, no grain, 2g protein/lb, etc. From all of that I firmly believe that in order to have optimal body composition and optimal health we MUST eliminate or greatly reduce our consumption of processed carbohydrates. I follow a primal/paleo lifestyle now. I eat eggs, nuts, fruits, veggies, meats. I avoid breads, pastas, flours, legumes, dairy(lactose intolerant as an Asian anyways). * To expand on the diet - I think Keto is very effective for losing fat, but can be hard to follow. What I do now is intermittent fasting and primal eating. This makes it almost effortless to maintain an 8-10% bodyfat and if I ever want to lose fat I simply lower my carb intake for two to three meals in the week. * [The best book I've ever read on the subject of nutrition that's written in an accessible and easy to read fashion is Mark Sisson's Primal Blueprint](http://www.amazon.com/The-Primal-Blueprint-Reprogram-effortless/dp/0982207786/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361403480&sr=8-1&keywords=primal+blueprint) * The best way to gain weight IMO is to increase your sources of healthy fats and eat nutritious carbohydrates. Healthy fats: avocados, coconut oiil, olive oil, almonds, almond butter to name a few. Nutritious carbohydrates: sweet potatoes, fruits, veggies, plantanes, yucca roots. * What kind of cardio did I do? I did a lot of steady state stuff. BUT today I do mostly high intensity interval cardio and circuit cardio. Examples of interval cardio: sprint for 60 seconds, walk for 90 seconds, repeat 5-6x. Example of cardio circuit: 20 pushups, 25 bodyweight squats, 6 pullups, 25 crunches, back to back with 30s rest before you do it again. Repeat 5-6x. This type of cardio imo is MUCH more efficient and actually better at helping you arrive at your fat loss/muscle building gains than doing steady state cardio(running/elliptical for half an hour or more.) - There is a study that showed participants who did 8 minutes of interval cardio where they exercised for 60s, rested for 30s, burned MORE calories than participants who did steady state cardio(hr of 150) for half an hour. * How do you incorporate running with weight lifting? - I run two times a week, always after my leg days. My leg days are monday and friday so I will run either tuesday and saturday, or after the leg workout on Monday and Fridays just depending on what I feel like doing. Always give your legs at least 36 hours if not 48 hours of full rest before doing heavy leg days. * What self-development books do I recommend? - ALL OF THEM. Megaliving and The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari by Robin Sharma are both really good. Tony Robbins has a bunch of good books, I've only read his Unlimited Power books however and it was pretty good. Jack Canfield(the author of all the chicken soup for the soul books) has some very nice books on finding success in life. Of course there's the cornerstone book of Think and Grow Rich which every self-development guru points to, and I have to say I found it to be a fantastic read. Code to Joy is a really interesting look at how early childhood traumas impact our present day emotions and actions. * I also HIGHLY recommend audio books. To date Earl Nightengale's ""The Strangest Secret"" is still the most motivational thing I've ever heard, here's a link to the full thing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62DqsD2s5V8 Load up your MP3 player with audio books and listen to them EVERYWHERE you go. Between driving, the gym, and random housework where you don't have to really focus the average person can squeeze in 3+ hours of audio books a day. That adds up to a tremendous amount of knowledge gained over a period of years. * **MEDITATION** Meditation is the ONE practice that lead me to be able to make every other inner change I've ever made. Without meditation I would not be the person I am. The real power in meditation is its ability to: center you, clear your thoughts, and give you that deep **knowing** that everything is okay, that no matter what happens you will be okay, and that life is wonderful. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in improving themselves to pick up the practice of meditating for at least 5 minutes each day. I meditate for 5 minutes in the morning, 20 min in the afternoon, and an additional 10 mins before I go to bed. It is very simple. I just focus on my breathing and bring my attention to the present. That's all you have to do. * PHEW alright I think that covered most of the questions, if you have more ask away, I'm going to monitor this thread closely for the next week. Edit: Added a FAQ to OP",Holy shit. Nice job.,652
19kzd4,"Hey guys :)  Pics first because attention span etc etc.  Before: http://i.imgur.com/qWpoB.png After: http://i.imgur.com/w0Ffq5a.jpg ------------------------------------------------------- I wanted to share with you guys where fitness has brought me over the last half year or so. I know a lot of girls are scared of heavy lifting, and I wanted to share my experience because it's been the best thing for my health, self esteem and aesthetics and it's now not just my passion, but part of my life.  I started getting into fitness the summer of 2012. I started off with typical 'girl' things like yoga, cardio etc. and I wasn't getting results. I lost a bit of weight, but that was mainly through diet. I started doing some research, reading r/fitness and decided to try out strength training.  When I first put a barbell on my back to try to squat, it felt like the world was resting on my shoulders. It was ugly, but I kept at it. I started lifting once a week, then I started realizing that every time I went back, the weight that felt like the world last week, now felt manageable. I did some bastardized once a week version of 'starting stregnth', but I was still getting results. By the end of the summer I had dropped the excess weight that I had and decided to stop losing and start eating to gain muscle. Eventually I got more and more comfortable and started lifting twice a week, then three times.  By about november of 2012, I dedicated myself to strength training and dropped all the other 'crap'. My lifts kept flying up. By January, I started following the Texas Method program.  ---------------------------------------------------- My lifts went from:  Squat: 65lbs - > 185lbs  Bench: 45lbs - > 120lbs  Deadlift: 65lbs - > 225lbs   My bodyweight went from 115 -> 98lbs (my lowest) -> 110lbs (now).  I've been 5'2 this whole time. Wish that went up, but I'll take what I can get.  -------------------------------------------------- Diet: I forgot to add this in because I don't really follow much of one. I eat until I'm full and just get enough protein. The best thing I've learned in terms of diet is portion sizes and how to estimate calories.  It comes out to about 1500 cals rest day, 2000 cals training days now.  When I was first losing weight, I was eating closer to 1200-1500 cals a day.  Supplementation:  I swig fish oil. And use some whey. I'm not a huge fan of stims, but I'll take some caffeine if I'm tired. Keeping it simple for now.  -------------------------------------------------- I've joined an olympic lifting team this month now following bulgarian methods and have switched my focus over from powerlifting, but it gave me the base strength and confidence I needed. I didn't turn into the hulk. I became strong. **Please ladies, please. Even if you don't want to be a powerlifter, get strong. Squatting 3x a week isn't going to kill you.** For the record, neither is squatting 5x a week. If I could tell you one thing, it's that consistency will be what determines whether you succeed or fail. Push hard, don't be afraid to fail the weight and just keep at it.  Don't overcomplicate things. Don't try to get everything perfect before you get in the gym. Just lift. And then lift a little more. It's simple, but it's not easy.  Thanks for reading! Let me know if you have any questions! ","Ladies, take note: She's ~~skinny~~ lean, but she doesn't look like she needs a sandwich. Fantastic job, keep it up. I wish more ladies knew what weight lifting would do for their legs.",210

I am around 8.5 weeks out from my very first show (NPC San Jose) and while I know that there are girls coming in who have much more experience and muscle definition, I'm hoping to show up really conditioned and take pride in the package I'm presenting on stage. I'm presenting this on my cakeday because it truly is my passion and what I'm MOST proud of: lifting heavy and eating clean every day. If you want to know how I did it check out my blog: http://ilyssagetsfit.blogspot.com . In the About Me section in the top right corner there is a link to a 9 page google doc I've written out to answer any of your questions. [Quick Link Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRnqHfnj_QkBPDY9xWFpwbaPNKQOtqPt9wWQR-tZ-WM/edit) **The most important thing for me to stress is that the reason I have gotten so lean, so quickly is because I do the big four movements with minor accessory isolation work to follow. I only do cardio 3 days a week, but I track every single macronutrient and calorie I take in (1900 cal a day even on this bikini cut). My deadlift has gone up to 225 pounds (though I'm positive I could pull more but don't train 1 rep maxes--I pulled 185 x 12 two weeks ago). I can squat my body weight and I'm pushing 95-100 pounds in my bench. I pick up iron and put it down. I'm not interested in machines that stabilize the weight for you. I'm not interested in ""bodypump"" classes that ""teach"" you how to incorporate weights into your routine. I lift heavy, every damn day, and have an amazing powerlifting team at San Jose State that supports me.** If you find something in that doc that I still haven't answered I'm willing to answer it here.

We're having a big event at Muscle Beach tomorrow to celebrate, and I wanted to invite all of you. I've always had a great time chiming in here when I have time - I even had the joy of having a couple of you write a Protein Bible (http://www.schwarzenegger.com/fitness/post/the-protein-bible-part-1-introduction) for my site.  So I wanted to make sure I invited you, because I will be hanging out from 3-4 and signing some copies of the latest Muscle and Fitness while some monsters work out in the pit around me. If you RSVP here I can leave some special Reddit wristbands at a tent for you so we can make sure that I can meet some of you in person.  But I want to make it really special for somebody. Here's the deal. Tell a story about fitness - something inspirational, something hilarious. . If you get the most upvotes and you can be at the event, I will save a VIP pass for you. Bring your gym clothes, because you'll be in the pit working out the whole time I'm there. I'll even give you some advices.  Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow. EDIT: KarmaPoIice was the top comment, so I'll see you there. I loved some of the stories so much I decided to expand it to five of you. I am not completely sure 5 will fit in the weightlifting area with all the people there, but if not, I want to at least take a picture with the five of you I replied to. You had some great stories.

When I was 19, about a month or 2 after I started lifting, I figured it was time to work on my legs a little bit. So I head in to my college rec center all hyped up on caffeine, clueless but enthusiastic. Right in the middle of the floor is a big, shiny leg press machine that had my name all over it. So I head over and load up a plate on each side. I get in the machine and hit a couple reps but it feels way too light, almost like nothing was on there. I think to myself ""wow my legs are pretty damn strong, I need to load this baby up."" At this point it's important to state that I am a pretty small guy, and at the time was even way smaller. Around 5' 8"" 115, that small. I also happened to be surrounded by dozens of beautiful college co eds and older, much more fit guys.  So anyways back to the story. After the first rep left me feeling like Hercules I started adding more plates. After I had 3 on each side, it STILL felt like nothing so I went in search of more. At this point I was going over to other peoples machines and asking them if I could have their plates, feeling like a badass for finally using the 45s on something. So I keep loading this thing up. I'm sure you all see where this is going. Anyways after I had about 6 plates on each side, I suddenly was struck with the blinding realization that I had been loading these plates on the holding racks, not the actual bar. Immediately I turned bright red and noticed the assortment of guys around me staring and snickering. Definitely one of my most embarrassing moments in the gym! So if I'm not too late to RSVP for the event tomorrow let me know! I'd really love to come by especially since it's only about a 2 minute walk away. Thanks!",1918
1on7f4,[Answering a question off of reddit by showing how he does a hotel workout!](http://instagram.com/p/fkjWbjDcRX/),"Thanks for posting. I saw the mention from /u/SetYourGoals and wanted to share. The point isn't the machines or the exercises. The point is that you can create a workout for your goals anywhere. Even if you just use a chair for dips, a table for rows, and the floor for pushups.  To answer the question further, I enjoy working out in unfamiliar gyms, even though sometimes I would prefer to be at home doing t-bar rows. But I like shocking my system, so I look at the bright side. And I am guessing you are wondering if it is possible to workout without being interrupted. It is, because generally in a gym people are very respectful and focused on themselves. Occasionally you see someone with their iPhone pointed at you, pretending to text even though the phone is at eye level. I always wonder why those people would rather take blurry shots of me than say hi while I'm resting, and possibly get a better photo with me once I've finished, as long as I have time. But yes, short version, people are mostly good. And if you ever see me, say hi, but don't slow me down while I'm working. Tell me you're from reddit once I've finished my workout and I will take a photo with you.  UPDATE: this happened today, and since we were talking about how hotel gyms might be different for me, it was too funny not to share: http://imgur.com/a/HGW3h",4508

1ulxw7,"So, I go to the ""anti-gym"" that is Planet Fitness. It's cheap, and all I can afford at the moment. However, my PF wasn't all that bad. It had squat rack, plenty of benches and dumbells, and I was able to do my workouts without hindrance. Until today. I walked in (luckily not on leg day) noticing the outline of dust on the floor where the squat rack once stood. I was heartbroken. Especially since I had just recently found a love for squatting (was always afraid due to my knee condition). I of course had to ask an employee ""WTF?"" He regretfully told me that a few days prior corporate came in and removed it because ""a customer complained that it was intimidating""... Again, what the fuck. So, me and my friend (extremely pissed) decided to come to Reddit to see if we can't do something funny to PF for this horrible act. we came up with the idea to get a bunch of people to email corporate PF and speak our minds about how ""intimidating"" their circuit training section is, and that we'd feel better working out there if it were removed. I can only imagine if a few thousand emails got sent in about this. They'd be dumbfounded. In the meantime, my friend and I are trying to figure out if we can swing paying to go to LA Fitness. Hopefully we'll be able to get out of the anti-gym for good. I honestly am embarrassed that I go there, but as  I said it's been my only option financially. Sorry for the vent/pointless post. Hopefully some of you will back us up on emailing corporate. It would be greatly appreciated.",Time for a new gym.,1827

Then I decided I would take in back with a vengeance. I started losing weight and getting healthy in tribute to my father. Every thing in the video and post is 100% true and factual, I may have done stuff ""normal"" people my size haven't, but not everyone has my determination and motivation. It hurt, my legs were sore, my feet were throbbing, my heart racing, but I focus 24/7 and when i feel like slowing down, I feel my fathers hand push my back and say, ""you got this, keep going"", So PLEASE quit with the hate, if you don't believe me fine, but my ENTIRE city has seen me do this in 6 months and I have their support, I just thought I would share to offer support to those looking for it. Thank you. -Jonathon ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Ok. So, To start, I was 477 pounds and completely miserable. I was in a size 60"" waist pants and a 6XL shirt. I was depressed, tired, and almost immobile. I had a history of giving up on myself, but not this time. I made a video to give my full history and story..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTk_ge1KIPU How did I do it? First off, I was monitored by a doctor, nutritionist, and the power of the internet to learn exercises. I had blood tests drawn every two weeks to make sure I didn't damage anything by losing weight so quickly. I did not.  I maintained a diet high in protein, low in carbs, and full of veggies and light on fruits. Absolutely no sweets in food form or drinks. I drank water only. I stayed on a 1500-2000 calorie diet.  I started out walking and progressed to jogging, then running, the running and lifting. As of today, I run/jog 65-70 miles a week. I weight lift 2 hours a day, 6 days a week.  I have not nor will I ever take any type of pill, drink, supplement, and I did not have a surgery. Everything I have done has been 100% natural.  Loose Skin?  Not too much really, I lift weights enough that it is filled in with muscle pretty good, where it is loose, is much better than full of fat in my opinion.  Too Fast? No, monitored by doctors made sure I lost quick but not too quick.  Before and after pics... http://i.imgur.com/9RG4Bsk.jpg -  http://i.imgur.com/8GSwykW.jpg - Holding old 60"" pants  Before and after info 60"" waist to a 42"" waist 6XL shirt to a XL Shirt 15 Shoes to a 12 Shoes 15 ring to a 12 Ring 23"" neck to a 17"" neck 22 minute mile to a 8-8.5 minute mile (single mile) could not do 5K to a 35 minute 5k I have walk/jogged/ran 1500 miles since July  I plan to lose about 60 more, to get to 250, then maintain by doing every other day workouts.   I am sure I am forgetting something, all questions welcome and if you like my video please share and subscribe, thanks.   EDIT* For the frequently asked questions on the comments 1.) Yes I walk/jog/run a total of 8-12 miles a day, if that sounds like a lot it is because it is. I wanted to do a marathon on my 1 year anniversary of starting my lifestyle, so that is where I train the hardest.  2.) Yes, I really am (in the picture) 317 pounds. I am 6'3""-6'4"" tall (When doctor originally measured I was slightly slouched because of my gut, and I was 6'3"" then. 3.) My diet is listed, it isn't much more than eating plenty of meats, 25-30G of low glycemic carbs, and the proper fats found in lean animal meats, nut and stuff like that. (need info on carbs? -http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU1BwjtnTO8) 4.) My bench did not ""Go Up"" from 165 to 335. I left high school benching 225-250, I played football, my position? Bench. lol. But i still got to lift weights. So in reality, I just had to retrain the muscles and get form back that was already there. I did not and do not have spaghetti arms, I did have a shoulder injury in high school and lifting on a bar irritates it, so I do not do it that often, I prefer working with individual plates so I can adjust weight accordingly, for those calling Bullshit on lifting 300 anything with arms, here is a video of a 360 Pound incline press on individual converging plates machine, ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEWy40Hmzsw) I know I know, its not the same, but I can move that kind of weight, I could only load to 360 pounds because the bar was full on both sides.  5.) My day is 100% focused to fitness. I told myself when i started, i will train as much as it takes, even it that means a temporary sacrifice of time with family and friends to get healthy. SO yes, 430 Im up and start running, run for 1.5-2 hours, come home, get kids to school, work out from 12-1 on lunch, get home go to gym or run from as early as 7pm-9pm, Then bed by 930 10. I do this at least 5 days a week, on weekends, my kids join me and we all go hiking, or walking or who knows what.  6.) I DO NOT TAKE supplements, that doesn't mean I am against them, it just means, I DO NOT take them. That is it, I prefer getting nutrition through food,  because I like to eat. lol 7.) I am not selling anything. I am trying to inspire people because I know what it feels like to be in the 400+ club and not see a lot of before and in progress pics. BEfore and After are cool, BUT they do not always show how hard the journey is physically and mentally. I share my journey to inspire anyone looking to lose weight. My name is Jwalt Fitness everywhere because my name is Jon Walt (Jwalt) and it is a blog/channel about my getting fit-_See the cleverness? lol  EDIT*** After so many people claiming it was not done in 6 months, but a longer time, here is a month to month comparison gif that shows the gradual but quick progress.

1wo5g0,"So I go to LA fitness for the sole purpose it is walking distance from my work.  I've trained there for about 2 years now.  Roughly 3 months ago I was doing squats in the squat rack and made eye contact with this guy.  Didnt think anything of it, until he is right in front of me while I am finishing my set.  Mind you I still have the bar on my back and he asks loudly ""If I have a fucking problem"".  I say ""Ughh no"" He then asks what the fuck am I looking at then.  I just laughed and said ""What"" he continued to get in my face, and I got upset and told him to fuck off and get out of my face.  Quickly a employee of the gym stops the confrontation and thats the end of it.  People at the gym were like wtf is that guys problem yada yada.  One of his buddies later on comes up to me and sort of apologies for how his friend acted and said he has issues and that he is 16.  Mind you he is about 5'8 and thick.  Like probably around 225 pound a lot of muscle.  I honestly thought he was around my age or maybe a few years younger. So I just told his friend dont worry about it, its not a big deal.  Well today I went to the gym and he was there with his chronies.  I noticed him staring at me multiple times, but just ignored him. On my way out of the locker room, he happened to pass by with his chronies, obviously was staring me down, I just smiled and as I passed by he says ""bitch"" and does one of those pro wrestling ""Wooo's""  Honestly I hate to say it, but he drives me nuts, in my younger days I would of done something, however I have a great job and a lot of other reasons why I dont smash his face with a brick.  Any advice for this jobber?  Edit: Getting bullied at 28 years of age by someone who is 16 is the most popular thing I have posted on reddit. Thats great.  I was busting loads when he was born. I technically could be his Dad.  Thanks for making this a lot more entertaining.  Oh yea he also has a mohawk.   Tried to tell my cat about it.   http://imgur.com/PQEe64W I  will update since this became pretty interesting to everyone.

Thanks","if it keeps up say something about him to a manager or faculty member at the gym. Mention that his behavior is negatively impacting your experience there and that you don't want to change to another gym but will if it continues.

Back in the day I used to be pretty jacked. Way back in the day. I have spent the last 7 years in an office and have not lifted a weight in probably 6 years.  A few hours ago, I go into the gym. Headphones on. In the zone. Sore all over already. Today is leg day. First leg day in 6+ years. Trying to do 5x5 routine because I'm skinny fat. Warm up a bit on treadmill. Make my way to squat rack. Smile at cutie on the way by. She smiles back. ""I'm the man"" playin.  Not sure what to go for. Back in the day, squatted like a beast. Momma didn't raise no dummy, load reasonable weight, use safety bar things. Notice cutie looking in the mirror. Load more weight. ""You got this"" Don't have it. Not at all. Bar comes off rack so hard. Legs straight buckle. Roll forward. Slam into wall. Deafening bang as bar slams down. Jump up like nothing happened. Gym is dead silent. People are watching. See Cutie blushing trying hard not to laugh.  Stand around for a second. Try and lift bar back onto rack. Can't. Eventually unload plates, get setup again. Squat less than I did in HS. Huff and puff the whole time. Almost puke on 5th set. Don't make eye contact with anyone for the rest of the time.

1z39pq,"For anyone who has had to ride public transportation, you know it is prone to spasmodic fits of lurches. Whatever gremlins live in the rails or in the minds of the train operators make a smooth, calm ride the pipe dream of Utopian fancy. The uninitiated should be informed that this is a prime opportunity for the activation of the gluteus maximus, tibialis anterior, and rectus femoris among others. Stand on trains, get swole. Roughly a year ago, I was on my commute to work as usual. All the seats were occupied by people either sleeping, reading, or trying to avoid eye contact with those standing in order to avoid the guilt induced by their comparative comfort. A woman, at least 8 months pregnant, waddled on to the train. You could hear the collective brows furrowing as all seated passengers focused more intently on the hideous, MC Hammer inspired carpet weave between their feet. Like the Spartans in Thermopylae, they would hold their ground. Said pregnant woman moved in the car, standing some four feet across the aisle from me. Before she could set her feet properly, or grasp a pole for support, the train lurched forward as if shot from a bow. This woman had not been following a balanced split routine, and had approximately 15 lbs of uncentered gainz protruding from her. She began to tip backwards on her heels like a tree being felled. In a flash of divine inspiration, I sprang into action. Reaching for the rail hanging from the ceiling, I wrapped my fingers tightly around it. No time to chalk up. I orangutaned across the car, stretching my left arm behind her. Dumbbell isolation had insured it was equal to the task. She and unborn child landed on my forearm. With a slow controlled release, I allowed my arm to extend completely underneath her weight, softening her fall and achieving full ROM. As I curled her body upwards, we locked eyes. I knew in that moment she loved me. She gazed at me with the fire I reserve for my protein shaker and an open power rack. As I slowly righted her, she mouthed, ""Thank you."" Bicep Charles whispered back, ""No, thank you.""  An abashed man relinquished his seat, which she took in an instant. We never spoke another word to each other. I moved down the car and returned to activating my glutes, the train thundering down the dark tunnel, lights flickering as we passed.",>15 lbs of uncentered gainz  Brilliant. ,2550

I am the person that you look at and wonder ""how could she have let herself get that way?""  Well, I got that way because losing weight is REALLY hard and I am addicted to food.   Here is my problem, and I hope you will take this seriously, because I am asking this in need of serious advice.  I would prefer advice from people who have been in my situation.  I am in pain a lot.  I have bad arthritis, especially in my knees and shoulders.  I've had x-rays showing bone spurs.  Moreso my back and neck hurt very, very badly whenever I try to walk.  My back begins to hurt within a minute of walking, or about five minutes of standing.  It gets worse and worse, and when I'm walking, the pain makes its way to my neck, as well.  It becomes nearly excruciating.  On top of that, I have athsma, which probably isn't surprising. Today I decided ""today is the day that I will start walking everyday"".  I walked less than 3/4 of a mile.  I wanted to die.  This sounds like nothing to you, I'm sure, but just the act of putting my sneakers on and lacing them to START walking was difficult.  Now, it's hours and hours later, and my neck and back still hurt.  I took 3 Aleve before I started walking, and 2 Tylenol about two hours later, and it's like I took nothing. My big question, after all this typing, is...  how to you get through the pain?  I know that I need to stick at it, if I want the payoff, but it is so tempting to just stay on the couch when I know that it's going to hurt so bad that I will want to cry. Serious replies only.

21yvse,"Hi Reddit! I love this place. I lurk on here with a couple different accounts but never actually submit anything. I'm currently recovering from a surgery and had nothing to do so I decided to compile a transformation post that I've been wanting to do for a while now. Here you go! **My transformation began in 2011.** *  This is a picture of me in 2011 weighing roughly 240lb @ 5'10"" age 22. [Clinically obese, class II.](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg) *  Shortly after that picture was taken I decided I needed to get my weight under control. I had become clinically obese and I wasn't happy physically, emotionally or spiritually.  *  Having no experience with the gym or dieting I didn't know where to begin. I'd heard of counting calories and I knew ""running makes you fit"" so I downloaded Lose It for iPhone and began eating in a deficit and running on an elliptical a couple times a week. [Here is fat me running on an elliptical...] (http://i.imgur.com/lDMgVmf.jpg) * In the beginning it was really easy to lose weight, the hard part was sticking to it. Going into a caloric deficit from eating an obese diet such as my own was as simple as cutting out sugar. For a while this was awesome. I cut out sugar, boom, 10lbs like that. I stopped eating breads, boom, 5lbs like that. Mind you, I was running on an elliptical daily. I wasn't sure what was working so I kept doing it all. *  This strategy got me down to about 180lbs as you can see in [this really shitty selfie (circa Sept. 2012).](http://i.imgur.com/wF3tvbR.jpg)  *  I got so good at being a cardio bunny that I hiked the Grand Canyon. [It was epic!! (Nov. 2012).](http://i.imgur.com/b8KGeW5.jpg) *  In the above picture (Grand Canyon) I was doing an insane amount of cardio and trying to remain in a caloric deficit. I was getting pretty skinny but was still fat. I think the term to describe myself at this point would be skinnyfat... *  I kept using my strategy of caloric deficit and high volume cardio through 2012 and most of 2013. My tricks for dropping weight had now resorted to a more severe zero carb diet. **2013 is when shit got real for me.**  *  Through this journey I had struggled with a dependency on prescription medications and alcohol. **On January 2nd 2013 I decided I needed to get a grip. I got clean, sober and quit smoking.**  *  Getting sober was the best thing I have ever done for myself mentally, physically and spiritually. Not to mention getting to drop those excess alcohol calories allowed me to eat a lot more! I love food... *  After getting clean and sober I started weight training. I had no idea what I was doing and stayed in a severe caloric deficit. [So I got really skinny...(July 2013 roughly 155-160lb)](http://i.imgur.com/CQtMdX7.png) *  In the above picture (July 2013) I was literally malnourished. I was living in Africa trying to remain zero carb because I was deathly afraid of getting fat. Mind you, most of the food I was given while I lived there were carbs so I mostly just didn't eat. I would pick up cans of tuna when they were available... It was pretty crazy looking back. *  When I returned to the US in September 2013 I quickly plumped up. I read The Paleo Solution by Robb Wolfe and the Primal Blueprint by Mark Sisson and I thought Paleo might be the answer. *  Eating Paleo and not counting calories I quickly put on fat. I was under the assumption that a calorie was NOT a calorie and as long as you suppressed insulin levels by not eating carbs you could eat as much as you wanted without getting fat. I read both of Dr. Phinney and Volek's books on ketosis and felt like I had a pretty good understanding of the subject. But as I found out time and time again during this journey, what works for one person does not necessarily work for another.  *  Upon my arrival home I also got really serious about weight training. I started squatting heavy(after reading Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe and I found a new passion in my life. [This was November of 2013. I thought I was freaking MASSIVE!](http://i.imgur.com/EPP71su.jpg) *  Soon after this picture was taken I decided I needed to show off my gainz and started tracking my macros. I lowered my calories pretty aggressively and continued to lift heavy. [I took this photo last week (March 23rd 2014).](http://i.imgur.com/GSDMvWT.jpg)   *  Going from extremely obese to pretty ripped I had accumulated some loose skin. Having known this was an inevitability for a while I had made the decision that I would get it surgically removed. [I took this photo March 24th 2014, the night before my operation.](http://i.imgur.com/wDZdndH.jpg)  And [here I am today, post op tubes and all...](http://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg)  **The fastest and most substantial results I got over this period were from lifting heavy weights and tracking macros.** Going into a caloric deficit definitely got me to lose weight but not until I started tracking macros with goals to hit regarding fats, proteins and carbs did I see substantial change. My macros during this cut were **220 protein, 150 carbs and 60 fats**. As I stalled I reduced calories from carbs, 50 at a time. I ended this cut reducing carbs in this fashion twice, consuming only 50 carbs a day for the last few weeks. For most people this would be way too aggressive of a caloric deficit but I know my body pretty well and I may have suffered some metabolic issues from my zero carb days. Also I cut out cardio all together. **About weight training...** I do a pretty high volume body building split because I enjoy lifting weights. I don't want to be in and out of the gym as quickly as possible and I don't ""feel"" low volume training. It has changed a little bit over time but this is my current lifts and split...                      . My current lifts are as follows: Bench - 225lb 1RM Squat - 315lb (working set) Deadlift - 365lb (working set) I haven't maxed on my deads or squat since December. 4 day split - Legs/Chest&Tris/Back&Bis/Shoulders&Tris rest repeat. Legs -  * Squats 5x5 * Deadlift 5x5 * Leg Press 4x8 * Leg Extension 4x12 * Hamstring Curl 4x12 Chest&Tris - * Flat Bench 5x5 * Incline Bench 5x5 * Incline DB Flies 4x8 * Weighted Dips 4x8 * Decline Skull Crushers 4x8 Back&Bis - * Pull ups 5xAMAP * Pendlay Rows 5x5 * Kroc Rows 4x8 * Lat Pulldown 4x8 * Hammer Curls 5x10 * 3 sets of 21s for dat hypertrophy Shoulders&Tris - * OHP 5x5 * Lateral DB Raises 5x10 * Facepulls 4x8 * Upright Rows 4x8 * Front Raise 4x8 * Weighted Dips 4x8 * Skull Crushers or French Press 4x8 Things of particular interest: *  **A calorie is a calorie.** Although peoples bodies respond to different foods differently, if you over-consume calories it will result in fat accumulation. *  **Tracking macronutrients is huge.** Although not as important as overall calories, getting adequate protein and keeping your carbs and fats in check is crucial to reaching any physique goals. *  **I made most of my gains while in a caloric deficit.** Although my lifts did not go up dramatically they steadily went up over time while I was losing weight. I attribute this to consuming adequate proteins and fats and smart training. I know scientifically it is almost impossible but I do think it can be done especially for a new lifter. *  **After reading endless books on diet and exercise (including Starting Strength), some of the most valuable info for me has come from watching youtube videos.** People like Chris Jones of Physiques of Greatness and Matt Ogus from Legends of Aesthetics are very knowledgeable about different exercises and how to properly perform them. They also have their diets dialed in. Although I am a man of science and greatly value empirical data, anecdotal evidence definitely has an important role in personal health. This journey is not over. In the beginning I did this to be fit because I didn't want to be the ""fat guy"" any more but it has evolved into so much more. It's a lifestyle that I have found a passion for. I've always viewed myself as a geek but in the last year I have started to identify more as a weight lifter. I haven't gone full bro but I do eat a lot of chicken breast out of Tupperware :-P. I'm currently stupid happy. People ask me all the time why I smile so much. I tell them it's because my life is tremendous. I'm not lying either. Becoming more active, dropping weight and lifting what used to be immovable objects showed me that I was capable of a lot more than I had thought possible. Without these things I don't think I would've ever had the courage to quit drugs and alcohol(and I like the way I look!).  edit: [picture of me now, stupid happy](http://i.imgur.com/Lmb8HHh.jpg) Thanks /r/Fitness  TL;DR: [Before](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/wDZdndH.jpg)","OP please post calves, they're probably massive.",697

23e1px,"This is the difference one year can make if you seriously want to make a change. I lost 55lb (25kg) by getting off my ass, joining a gym and (mostly) cutting out the crap food. Yes it was hard, yes I sometimes went backwards, but most importantly, yes it was worth it. Ive gone from being unhappy and unhealthy to the complete opposite in twelve months and have never been happier.  Before and after http://imgur.com/gKthfhP Edit: Holy shit!!! Seriously, thanks guys. Thats some damn kind words.  Ok so I know I didn't put enough info initially so here's here how I did it. I moved across the country where the climate is very very hot and dry. So naturally I drank a lot of beer, pretty much daily. We're talking about at least 6 bottles daily (adds up, as you can see). With all the extra drinking came the hungover food runs...usually involving fried chicken. I was smoking like a chimney and not exercising, probably using the heat as an excuse. When I moved back to chilly Melbourne I joined a gym. I started off going maybe once every second day, but would only go on the treadmill for half an hour or so and call it a day. Once I got some confidence up I started joining the group classes. I became addicted to Les Mills Body Pump (an all over body weights/cardio class) and I continue to go at least twice a week. It's so much fun and I'm starting to see real results from it. I also started with the couch 2 10k app. When I started, I couldnt run 30 seconds without losing ny breath. I can now run 8km easy, and recently hit 10km. I don't think id have kept going without it - it really helps having a goal and I like being told when I'm half way. I plan on training for a half marathon next.  I want to lose a bit more fat, then get started on some serious weight training. Any advice on where to start would be much appreciated! In regards to my diet, obviously I've cut back alot on the drinking, and have quit smoking. I still drink occasionally, just not every day.  During the week, I'm fairly strict with my diet. I need to learn to be more creative with my meals though...one week all I ate was kangaroo sausages and steamed green veg. Not very exciting. I've cut back on potatoes, which are my favorite thing ever. I have them maybe once a week now. I've swapped pasta for soba noodles. I eat alot more veg and chicken breast. Long story short, I could be alot more strict with my diet, and could exercise more. But I look how far I've come and know I'm doing something right. Looking forward to showing you all what I can do this year! Thanks again for all the love.    ","Wow. Big change but you should add more details in your post. Like age, height and how did you work out.",346

24xvf6,"It happened again today at the gym. A guy was using the power rack when I arrived, so I sat nearby and waited. After his sets, he approached me with a friendly smile. He struck a conversation, then dropped this on me: ""You should focus on cardio for now,"" he told me. ""It'll speed up your weight loss. Lifting won't help as much."" I said 'thank you,' I smiled, and I started loading the barbell. I've learned to just shut up and nod when I get unsolicited advice. It's the fatty's curse at the gym: nobody is laughing at you, but they always figure they know better than you what *you* need. If I had wanted to reply to the dude's advice, there's a few things I would have told him. I would have explained that he doesn't know a few things about me: - I used to weigh 80 lbs more than I do now. I may look fat to him, but this is me at my fittest in a long, long time. - I happen to do cardio, as my first passion is distance running. I ran 25 km (edit: in one run) last summer, but I realized my weight was holding me back as a runner, so I decided to solve the weight issue once and for all. Weight training is a way for me to maintain muscle mass while I lose weight, and I'm not doing cardio while I learn my program. - I've lost 15 lbs in 2 months of counting calories, eating clean, and going to the gym, so why the hell would I change anything? - One big reason I lift weights is that I fell in love with lifting. Why the hell should I stop? My stats are going up even though I'm cutting. Squatting and deadlifting give me a rush, and I'm getting a shitload of health benefits from my new strength. The first time I received unsolicited advice, it really hit me hard; I had second thoughts about lifting for two days, then thought 'fuck it' and kept at it. If it were people mocking me, I'd probably feel encouraged out of a desire to prove them wrong. But when people come at me with misguided kindness, it can really make me doubt myself. So there you have it. My advice to any experienced lifter who sees us fatties and DYELs struggle with our program is this: 1. **Encouragement is always welcome.** As long as it's genuine and not condescending, we'll appreciate it. Don't feel you have to, though; we don't *need* you to cheer us, it's just nice when someone does it. 2. **Be careful with unsolicited advice.** If someone asks and seems to really care, then go ahead and be as harsh as you want. Otherwise, just strike a conversation and let us bring it up if we want it. 3. **Don't presume you know our story and our goals.** You have *no idea* where we started and where we're going. Don't assume we just woke up last week and decided to stop eating junk and lose weight. Thanks for listening! P.S.: Yes, I realize the irony of giving unsolicited advice against giving unsolicited advice. **EDIT:** Wow, that blew up way more than I expected. Thanks for the discussion! Just want to clarify a few points: - The guy giving me advice today wasn't an asshole. I believe he genuinely wanted to help. He made a few assumptions about me, but he wanted to help. That's my point: if I were being mocked in the gym, I wouldn't give a damn. But getting advice that makes me realize you think I don't belong in the weight room can be a bummer. - I'm not losing sleep over this, nor am I angry at the guy. I just wrote this post because it struck me as an interesting point of discussion for this, a fitness-related subreddit. /r/fitness has been instrumental in giving me the knowledge and courage to lift, so this is where I come to process stuff. If you think that's not worth a post, downvote and move on. - Yeah, I should have talked to him about it. Call it [esprit d'escalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esprit_d%27escalier). I will if it comes up again, either with him or someone else.","Oh man, saw someone try to give some pretty harsh unsolicited advice to a ""fatty"" about squatting, the ""fatty"" turned out to be a super heavyweight powerlifter. Instead of saying anything the guy just banged out 20 reps with the guys max to loosen up and went about his business. The advice bro just snuck out of the gym afterwards.",2018
25fwnd,"*Long time lurker here. I am by no means an expert (who is here, besides Phrak, really?) but having finished StrongLifts a couple weeks ago after roughly 11 months on it, I thought I could try to give back to the community, having leeched off of it for so long.*  *This isn't gonna cover everything lifting-related. The [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/index) and [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq) is for that. These are supplemental StrongLift (SL)-specific tips for people who are just starting SL and have researched the programme already. The [website](http://stronglifts.com/5x5/) has a wealth of information - read it. You don't even need to download the ""guide"".*  *The first 5 tips are cues for each lift which I found helpful. Before you skip over them, realise that the lifts* **are** *the programme. Sure it's important to understand the programming and the rationale behind SL but there's no point in continuing with it if you couldn't care less about form.*  So on to the advices:  **1. Learn to deadlift properly.** [use these videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS2wLZSdeDg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;list=PLbFxzzq99IUD1bxzKq7UUBI1TGjNSKUWB&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;index=1) * Stand with bar over your mid-foot. * Keep stance fairly narrow. * Keep your head neutral. * Bend knees until shins hit the bar. * Shoulder-blades should be directly above bar. * Hold the bar low in your hands, close to your fingers. * Keep hips relatively high - this is NOT a squat! * Lift your chest but DON'T squeeze your shoulder blades. * Get slack out of your arms. * Pull and keep bar close to your body. Dig heels into ground. * Think about pulling the bar back - NOT up. * Do NOT lean back at top/roll your shoulder back. * Pull quickly, even on warm-up sets. * Lower weight back down relatively quickly.  **2. Learn to OHP properly.** [use this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqKhLR1zRaU) * Feet shoulder-width apart. * Grip bar just wider than your shoulders. * Hold bar close to your wrist (not close to your fingers). Keep wrist straight. * Elbows in front of bar but NOT upper-arms parallel with the floor. Elbows should not exceed a 45 degree angle out from your body (i.e. do not flare elbows). * Chest up and look forward - NOT up/down. * Once the bar reaches forehead level, shift torso forward. * Nicolas Cage the bar up. * Squeeze dat ass at the top and lock everything.  **3. Learn to squat properly.** [use these videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ME8gEN54Ao&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;list=PLD7BE939BB32B4CAB&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;index=1) *Note: this describes a low bar (aka powerlifting style) squat, which SL calls for. It is generally safer than a high bar squat and offers better leverage, allowing you to lift more.*    * Tighten-upper back. * Make sure the bar is evenly spaced across your back. * Hands should be in line with forearms and NOT supporting the bar (i.e. keep thumbs over the bar). * Lift chest up and forward and keep it there (don't let it fall). * Keep shoulders back and down. * [Keep elbows down.](http://squatrx.blogspot.com/2010/02/elbow-positioning-when-squatting.html) * Head neutral. * [Keep bar low on back.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2tyOLvArw0) * Wide foot stance. * Keep knees out! * Keep weight on HEELS and mid foot (*curl toes if necessary to prevent putting weight on balls of feet*). * Always keep your back neutral or *slightly* curved (but NEVER rounded). * At the bottom of your squat, drive up with your ass! (Imagine a chain from the ceiling pulling lower back straight up). * Try to raise chest at same time (i.e. do not turn the lift into a [good-morning](http://firstpull.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/vap9o.jpg)). * Squeeze dat ass at the top.  **4. Learn to bench press properly.** [use these videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHx1gYTA-Rw&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;list=PL38D8B0C3BFDB82F2&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;index=1) *Note: 95% of the bros in my gym don't bench like this and I don't understand why. The trainers in my gym call it the ""powerlifting style"" bench but I can't see how any other style would be beneficial.* * Forearms perpendicular to the floor when bar touches your chest. * Put the bar in your palm, close to your wrist (NOT close to fingers). * Tight upper-back. * Eyes directly under bar (when the bar is racked). * Chest up and big arch in back, but keeping ass on bench. * Weight should be on the traps. * Feet as far back as possible. * Knees should be lower than hips. * Keep legs tight. * Squeeze the bar (helped me a lot!). * Press in a straight line with elbows close to ribs (flaring is easier but will lead to injuries in the long-run). * Imagine breaking bar in half towards your feet.  **5. Learn to row properly.** [use this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlRrIsoDpKg) * Row from the floor every time. * Keep bar very close to legs before pulling. * Grip the bar like you bench press (i.e. squeeze it). * Pull with your elbows. * Row against your chest. * Keep upper back parallel with floor. * Open your chest at top of movement (squeeze shoulder blades for a second). * Keep your head *down* (take this time to look for cracks in the floor from all the weight you've been throwing around).  **6. Don't add weight too quickly.**     The programme will seem easy at the start but the whole point is to perfect the form for each lift at a lower weight so you don't injure yourself at a higher one. Resist the temptation.     EDIT: To clarify, of course add weight every workout. But stick to the programme increments (2.5kg for everything except deadlift). If you've lifted before (and your form is great), you can start at 50% of your 5RM, but the increments should be the same as for beginners.  **7. With that said, progress properly.** * Never lower weight DURING a workout, even if you only get 5/5/4/2/1 reps. * But do not increase the weight for the next workout if that happens (aim for 5 x 5 on same weight). * If you don't achieve 5x5 for a certain weight 3 times in a row then deload weight by 10%. * If you have to deload 2x on a lift, switch to SL 3x5. * If you have to deload 2x on a lift during 3x5, switch to SL 1x5. * If you have to deload 2x on a lift during 1x5, you're finished StrongLifts!  **8. Warm-up properly.**     Mehdi advocates SOLELY warming up with the lift itself but this is the one and only thing I disagree with about the whole programme. Learn to foam roll and do the [Limber 11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSSDLDhbacc) before every workout.     Then move on to warming up with the lifts.     EDIT: A lot of people are concerned about this point. I am not advocating static stretching (which has in fact been proven to *reduce* strength if done before training). The Limber 11 utilizes **dynamic stretches** which are very different.  **9. Don't accessorize too early.**     If you're going to add accessories, don't do it too early or you risk not being recovered in time for the next session. You're doing this programme for a reason - strength. I must confess I started adding dips/bicep charles in the last few weeks but only because most of my lifts were down to 1x5 so my workouts were short and my volume low. **10. Accessorize the right way.**     If you do decide to add accessories anyway, here is what the original SL guide recommended: Workout A Squat 5x5  Bench Press 5x5  Barbell Row 5x5  Dips 3xF Workout B Squat 5x5  Overhead Press 5x5  Deadlift 1x5  Pull-ups/Chinups 3xF (alternate between both types)  **11. Do [these 5 stretches](http://bretcontreras.com/5-things-you-should-do-everyday/) on your off days.**  **12. Don't be shy.**     If you get unusually sore (DOMS is NOT unusual), try mobility work and stretching but most importantly - ask here (a video of your form is 1000 times better than trying to describe your problem in words). Or even better - get it looked at by a professional! My upper arm started to hurt a lot during squats. As an arrogant, overly-confident med student, I diagnosed it myself as bicep tendonitis. Turns out it was a rotator cuff issue, and I should have been icing in a different place all along. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/136g31/shoulder_stability_and_rotator_cuff_exercises_for/) Fittit thread helped immensely, as did changing grip, like in [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUTcYA9daoE) video. ///////////////////////  *Finally, stick with the programme - it works. You will go through cycles of hating and loving each exercise depending on what you're making progress in/plateauing in. Most important thing is that you love training as a whole and look forward to it. Find your ""why"" for training and never forget it.* *Regarding Mehdi's Inner Circle, I can't vouch for it as I never joined it. The community here is one of the best fitness resources on the internet, so I never felt there was a need to go somewhere else. I also wouldn't bother signing up for his emails. They get repetitive very early and are mostly advertising. With that said, I do feel Mehdi deserves something for all the inspiration and the information he provides. So if you have the money, it might be nice to [buy a month's membership](https://strongliftsinnercircle.com/join/) just to help the guy out.* *If anyone has any SL-RELATED questions (I'm not a doctor/qualified trainer) please ask. If anyone disagrees with any of the above points, please let me know. Particularly the form tips. I'm starting Madcow this week and would hate to think that I was still doing something wrong at this stage!*     *EDIT: Wow I got gold. How neat is that?*",tl;dr: do shit properly,470

I was listening to the Cracked podcast this morning and it had some great insight to food companies, weight loss and gain, along with some anecdotes.  http://www.cracked.com/podcast/why-food-industry-way-more-evil-than-you-think/ EDIT: *This is not the point of this post.. if you take Cracked at face value and make comments on the brand prior to listening to what these guys have to say on a bunch of different subjects it is really your own loss. The guys are a pretty good listen.*   I am here to let every one know that weight loss is not a one way street. It is not ""once I get there it is 'just* maintenance."" It is not. I lost a lot of weight and put on good, healthy muscle. Weight from a 48/50 waist to a 32/34 http://i.imgur.com/5l7TnIZ.png  Life was great.... for about a year.  Now.. here I am a couple years later, nearly back at the weight I started at. I was foolish enough to think that my body physiology some how changed after I lost 70 pounds and that what I ate, how much, and my exercise would somehow magically be all better once I hit my goal weight of under 200 pounds.  It doesn't.  I got lazy, complacent, and went back to old bad eating habits (getting married to a lady who knows her way around a kitchen sure didn't help). As all the clothes I purchased for my new body continually got tighter and tighter I didn't stop.. I don't know why, I knew all the hard work I put in.. and did it anyway.  Post weight loss lifestyle should remain as vigorous and focused as it was when you were losing the weight. Not trail off once you think you've ""changed enough"". Your body is not void of those fat cells.. they are just smaller and your body will want to blow right back up. AND QUICKLY. The figures the podcast brought up were some 2 out of every 1,000 people keep the weight off after 5 years.  IT IS NOT EASY.  They talk about Jared from Subway. His only job to make millions of dollars was to be thin.. but he couldn't. Because its not easy.  This is your reminder to KEEP AT IT.  WORK HARD. EAT RIGHT. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.  EDIT: *Listening to Cracked podcast isn't the point... Just what I happened to have listened to that helped me realize where I was vs a year ago. Anyone focusing on that part of what I am saying is missing the point.* ","Once you're done cutting or losing weight, you can ""relax"" and move to maintenance calories. That is not going to make you fat. You don't need to be as dilligent or as focused on your weight once you've reached your target weight. Monitor weight and give yourself a +/- 5 lbs window to bounce around within. If you move out of that range, mini cut or bulk to your goal weight again. You definitely DO NOT need to maintain the absolutely strict lifestyle you had during your weightloss period. Anyone saying otherwise does not understand calories in - calories out. ",955
29llcf,"After seeing many other transformations on r/fitness, I thought I would share mine with everyone!  http://s14.postimg.org/612ut4roh/photo12.jpg - Before/After  http://s11.postimg.org/gpjfiswcz/photo_2_3.jpg - A few Days ago! http://s24.postimg.org/5cuqkzdsl/photo_1_4.jpg - Legs *warning* not tan, but at least they are proportionate.   I picked up my first weight when I was almost 20 years old and had no idea what the hell I was doing. I started my fitness journey like many other teens my age. My girlfriend and I had just broken up and I noticed how uncomfortable I felt in my body without having the crutch of a significant other (she always told me I looked good, which was nice of her). However, I had been self-conscious my entire life and I was sick of it. I lacked a lot of muscle, and anything that looked like muscle was really just fat in the right places. I spent any free time I had playing xbox. Modern Warfare 2 was my life back then.  It was a slow process getting into the hang of things and learning my way around the gym. I asked a lot of questions and did a ton of research from the get-go, but since there was SO MUCH information out there I often couldn't stay consistent.  Time flew by and eventually I had hit my two and a half year mark of lifting. I looked ""alright"" but nothing like I thought I would look after hitting the gym hard almost every day. I couldn't quite wrap my head around things since all my friends were making better progress than me. That's when the word DIET came into play.  Even though I had been going to the gym and doing all sorts of lifting routines, I was still drinking on the weekends and eating my bodyweight in Jack-in-the-Box tacos. My diet was absolutely terrible.  I started slow with the diet process again and eventually learned what macros were and that carbohydrates had nothing to do with carbonation in soda (seriously, I thought that). My favorite dieting technique that helped the most was carb-cycling. I liked the fact that I could have a day with a lot of carbs and still continue to see results.  Fast forward to today. I am now a Bodybuilding.com employee and clothing model. I have come A LONG way since my beginning and have changed my body composition through DIET, TRAINING, and necessary SUPPLEMENTATION (whey, multi vitamin, creatine, bcaa). I never jumped on the pro-hormone or steroid bandwagon due to me already being a hypochondriac, and messing with something like that would probably be the end of me. (No offense to anyone who has taken that path). I am now 24 years old. I am 4.5% bodyfat (7-point pinch test) at 192 lbs, and 6'1 feet tall.  I started at around 21% (7-point pinch test) bodyfat at 185 lbs, 6'1. My name is Anthony Fisher Proof! http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/bodybuildingcom-clothing/core-vertical-contrast-stringer-tank.html  Edit* Added a couple more upper body shots and a leg shot.  Edit two* If I could give you guys the perfect diet plan and training routine, by all means I would! However, it took me years of trial and error to find what would work for me personally. Everyone is different and learning the hard way is actually the best way to learn! Knowing your body is key! Taking the time to research different diets that work best for your lifestyle and that are feasible are going to be your best bet! As cliche as this sounds, I did all my research from when I was 19, until now on bodybuilding.com. The idea is to group similar information and stick with it! It's all about being consistent. Nobody get's anywhere doing fad diets.  You want to lose fat? Then stick with losing fat. You want muscle? Than focus on building muscle. Doing both at the same time can be difficult for a newbie, but not impossible with enough education. If I could do it all over again I wouldn't change a thing. I'm glad it took me a while because it gave me something to chase. And you know what? I still haven't caught it. With that said, here is a general idea of what I eat everyday to stay lean! Breakfast! (shake) 1 Cup oats, 1 Cup Spinach, 1 Scoop whey isolate,  1/2 Cup of blueberries,  2 Cups of 30 cal almond milk Snack! 1 Cookie Dough Quest Bar (heaven in a wrapper),  1 Whole wheat bagel, 1 tbs of low sugar jelly, 1 Cup of coffee :))) Lunch! 1 Cup brown rice,  1 cup Brocoli,  4 oz chicken,  1 tbs olive oil,  Snack 3 rice cakes, 1 scoop whey isolate,  Dinner! 2 High fiber tortillas, 6 oz chicken,  1 cup spinach,  Salsa to taste,  Bedtime snack! 1 cup cottage cheese, 1 tbs low sugar jelly, 15 toasted coconut almonds :) As far as training goes, I stick with the same routine/plan for about 1-2 months and then drastically change it!  Sunday - Chest/triceps  Monday - Back/legs  Tuesday - 30 min of HIIT cardio (only cardio I do) Wednesday - Arms/Abs Thursday - Shoulders/Abs Friday - Legs  Saturday - Video games  Hopefully that helps some of you guys! Also, I'm not famous, just an average dude who got an awesome opportunity. The closest thing I have to answering any questions after this is Instagram. ""anthonyyfisherr"" P.S. You guy's are MOTIVATING the hell out of me to keep living this lifestyle! THANK YOU! ",So much bullshit. Clearly already lifts in before picture. Way under 21% body fat in before picture. Runs a cycle and crowns himself your new natty god. This guy is just shilling for bodybuilding.com you idiots.,346

2coltt,"I've been re-reading the SS wiki and I came across this part: >If you want to look like some Abercrombie model, then find another program and enjoy your nice, easy training style. The thing is, and I know it's bad to admit it, but I really *do* just want to look like an Abercrombie model. Sure strength is great and everything, but I'd be happy just looking really good. Is there a particular program that would suit this kind of person better? Or is it better to just stick with SS / similar? Edit: Just want to say thank you to everyone here. This was my first post, and everyone has been incredibly informative and welcoming. Seriously helped a lot. Thanks!

2cz87v,"I hadn't planned on making a Year 2 progress post, but my comment in [this thread about skinnyfat transformations](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2byb1m/are_there_any_real_skinnyfat_transformations/) got more replies than I would have expected. One of them dubbed me Supermanlet, an epithet that I'm not sure I deserve but which filled me with pride. The overall appeal to my vanity got the best of me, so here I am with a frackin' novella about my progress. ### Basic Stats |Topic              |Information| |:------------------|:----------| |Gender             |    Male   | |Current Age        |     29    | |Height |  5'4""  | |Current weight |  129 lbs  | |Athletic Experience|I played the shit out of Epyx Winter Games on Commodore 64| |Lifting Experience |  2 years  | ### Pictures I'll start with some pictures. There's a long-winded, rambling wall of text below, which I know most people don't want to read. Those that are interested will only be interested if the pictures pique their interest. So, pictures first. * **[June 2012 Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/irs7x)**: A handful of selfies I took for comparison one week before I joined the gym. This wasn't the start of my positive changes, but I consider it the starting point for when I got serious about making changes. * **[February 2013 Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/Yv14O)**: I didn't keep progress pics for the early months where the most drastic changes occurred, but I did take some in February.  * **[June 2013 Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/dcX5J)**: Anniversary progress pics taken exactly one year after the June 2012 pics.  * **[July 2014 Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/5TZFR)**: Pics taken this summer, showing two years of progress.  * **[Year-by-year image](http://imgur.com/MU8UWyL)**: A side-by-side image, attempting to match the lighting and pose from last year  * **[Clothes-on progress](http://imgur.com/a/iLCZI)**: Unfortunately, I can't just walk around shirtless everywhere I go. I'm forced to wear clothes that hide my progress. Here are a handful of pictures taken over the years to see what the change looks like with clothing over top of it.  I'm somewhat of a smallfry at 5'4"". In the June 2012 pictures, I weighed 137 lbs. In June 2013, I weighed 122 lbs. My current weight is 129 lbs. I'm almost 100% certain that I'm the smallest guy I've seen at my gym. ### Background and Personal Fitness History My prior athletic experience is pretty much nil. I bowled until I was in grade 7, and lifted weights (machines only) for a few months in grade 9. I did track and field in high school because a girl I liked convinced me to join, but I performed terribly. Otherwise, nothing. My entire adult life has been spent hunched over computers and/or gaming tables. I've had some marathon gaming sessions, but even the *thought* of going for a run was nauseating. I've had body image issues at least as far back as third grade (my grade 3 teacher wrote in my record card that I had trouble with other kids making fun of me for being so skinny). When I got my first apartment at age 20, I weighed under 100 lbs - the literal 98-pound weakling of Charles Atlas fame. I wasn't anorexic, but I undoubtedly looked like I was. I resolved to gain some weight through a powerful diet plan called Eating Like a Lazy Bachelor. I adhered to this diet religiously from 2005 until 2011. This diet consisted of a steady stream of frozen pizzas and hot dogs, as well a delicacy of my own design: I would tear open croissants, and stuff them with peanut butter and shredded cheese. The diet had its perks, but somewhere along the line I forgot that I started eating like a pig to reach a reasonable BMI. By 2011, my weight was in the 150-155 lb range. That might not *sound* like much, but that was on a 5'4"" frame with narrow shoulders and waist, and only enough muscle mass to handle slouching in front of a computer all day. I went from being ashamed of my bony physique to being ashamed of what resembled a hairy, second trimester baby bump. Most people didn't think I looked overweight, which I attribute to an all-black wardrobe of oversized shirts hiding the baby bump, and my Riker hiding my lack of a jawline. Some co-workers thought it was a bad idea to lose weight because I was already ""so skinny."" They hadn't seen me shirtless to learn the lumpy, skinnyfat truth. In 2011, I started worrying about things from the health perspective, in addition to my already robust sense of aesthetic shame. I became troubled by how unfit I was, and how pathetically inadequate my body was for what should have been simple physical tasks. I started to question what I was doing to my life expectancy, and how young I would be before I could expect my first heart attack. This motivated me to make some small changes at first. I started to pack a lunch to work, instead of relying on Oh Henry bars and Doritos from the break room to tide me over until my Evening Gorge. I got an elliptical machine at home, but didn't really start to use it until I realized I could read my textbooks on it (I called this my educise). At first, it only took about 5 minutes at the lowest resistance setting to completely wipe me out. The progress I made with such small changes was very encouraging, and in summer 2012 I had more spare time than I was used to, so I doubled down and got started for real. I fully committed myself to looking good naked. ### Lift Progress I log my progress using Jefit for Android, and have done so since the beginning. All of the 1RM numbers below (aside from the StrStd screenshot) are taken from the 1RM calculator in Jefit based on my workout logs. I have never tested my 1RM for any exercise, and don't intend to. I'm in this mainly for aesthetics and a bit of general health; I'm not interested in powerlifting, so the weight on the bar is of secondary importance to me. I've changed programs and rep ranges a few times, so the calculated 1RM numbers swing on occasion. I also haven't been doing all of the barbell compounds for the full 2 years I've been lifting.  |1RM (est)|June 2012 |  Nov 2012  |  July 2013 | July 2014  | |:--------|:--------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:| |Squat    |    63    |     231    |    224     |    239     | |Bench    |          |     130    |    158     |    187     | |Deadlift |          |            |    239     |    320     | Squat numbers, aside from the most recent, should be taken with a grain of salt. My squat form has been inconsistent over time, and I've deloaded on several occasions to fix my depth. Unfortunately, my logs don't show when I was being a shithead doing partial reps. **[StrStd screenshot](http://imgur.com/OcUYG8y)** The spreadsheet used to produce the graphs below can be [viewed on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aob8UQ1p9l9ydE1IY1RySmk4RjB6QkZ2QVFvWlRORUE&gid=3) Squat  * [Graph of squat progress over time](http://i.imgur.com/xSM9e7J.png)  * I did squats in sets of 12 until December 2013, and for a long time my depth was terrible - so the lack of progress in the graph is misleading, as the early progress is basically just bad data.  * This isn't going to be a popular opinion around here, but squats are the bane of my existence. I hate them *so much*. I never skip them, but I just absolutely fucking hate squats.  * Squats are the only exercise that I worry about failing, and have never pushed myself to failure. By contrast, I bench to failure very regularly.  * Sometimes it seems like every time I add a little weight, I take away a little depth. I was doing 4x5 at 225 lbs with questionable form in March, so in April I deloaded and switched to pause squats for a while to work on depth again. Currently, I squat 3x5 at 205 lbs. Depth is currently fine, but I still feel weak at the bottom, and haven't added any weight for more than a month. Bench Press  * [Graph of bench progress over time](http://i.imgur.com/pVpuZ0H.png)  * I didn't do barbell bench presses for my first six months at the gym. I was actually a little bit scared of being under the bar, so I did dumbbell chest presses instead. That changed when I dropped a dumbbell on my chest, and decided I would rather have a bench with a rack and safety bar to rely on when I fail.  * My bench press would not be accepted in competition, as I don't touch my chest and pause. This is due to a combination of an immovable safety bar on the bench, and a tiny chest; I have to take a painful back arch to get my chest above that safety bar. I bring my arms below parallel, which is good enough ROM for me. Deadlift  * [Graph of deadlift progress over time](http://i.imgur.com/EGE5Dl3.png)  * I started doing deadlifts in July 2013. Before that, I only did RDL's for higher reps.  * I love deadlifts, but have been consistently frustrated by grip as a limiting factor. No matter how much grip training I do, my tiny little handlets can't hang on to the bar. After repeated grip failures attempting to hit 260x5, I thought I'd give hook grip a try, but found that my fingers aren't long enough for it. I finally decided it was time to buy straps. I've used them twice, and very much enjoyed an easy step up to 275x5.   Overhead Press  * I know that Fittit loves them, but I don't do barbell overhead presses. I stick to dumbbells for my shoulders. My gym only has one rack and not many barbells, so dumbbells are just easier to fit into my routine Other Lifts/Accessories  * **Planks**: Planks are my absolute favourite ab exercise, and I've included some variation of the plank since I started in 2012. At the start, I struggled to hold a shaky plank for 90 seconds, with a pool of sweat forming on the mat under my face. Within a few months, I was able to hit seven minutes. I switched to the much more difficult RKC plank variation, then added weight when that wasn't enough. Currently I do three sets of RKC planks, held for 90 seconds with 35 lbs on my lower back.  * **Dragon flags**:  Also awesome. First tried these in March 2013, and was only able to do 4 forced negatives. My current PR is 12 full reps (though the first rep off the bench is a bit shaky).  * **L-Sits**: Started doing L-Sits on parallel bars just this past January. PR is 43 seconds (a failed attempt to hit 45).  * **Pullups**: Jefit changed how assisted/unweighted/weighted pullups are recorded, so I don't have my oldest logs, but I think I remember struggling to do pullups with 70 or 80 lbs of assistance. I now use a dip belt to add weight, and my PR is 35 lbs for 8 reps.     ### Training Regimen I'll start with my current program, then give some of the history of my previous (occasionally questionable) routines. My current routine (since the start of May) is based on Layne Norton's [PHAT](http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html) template. This is a five day routine, with two days lifting heavy for strength and power, and three days of bodybuilding-style training.  The most significant changes I made are as follows: * added deadlifts on the Lower Body Power day (Norton only includes one lower body compound on this day) * added ab exercises to both lower body days (because I love abs, and this gives extra incentive to not skip leg day) * added grip and forearm work on Chest and Arms Hypertrophy day (because I really need the grip work) * changed the order of many movements and added some supersets (because I can handle fatigue better and lift more with the changed order) * changed a handful of rep ranges from sets of 20 to sets of 15 (because sets of 20 are murder) * added some oblique exercises on 'rest' days (because I couldn't find time to fit obliques in elsewhere) The full routine breaks down as follows **Monday:** Yoga, HIIT on rowing machine, obliques, and low intensity cardio   **Tuesday:** [Upper Body Power Day](http://i.imgur.com/wfyY48g.png)   **Wednesday:** [Lower Body Power Day](http://i.imgur.com/m5ztGrD.png)   **Thursday:** HIIT on rowing machine, obliques, low intensity cardio, and yoga   **Friday:** [Back and Shoulders Hypertrophy Day](http://i.imgur.com/68jaSMK.png)   **Saturday:** [Lower Body Hypertrophy Day](http://i.imgur.com/aZ5CnLn.png)   **Sunday:** [Chest and Arms Hypertrophy Day](http://i.imgur.com/cxb9sWh.png) (this lists both wrist roller and wrist curls - I do one or the other, not both) I've been extremely pleased with my results from this routine, especially in adding mass to my arms, which have always been too thin. I may have to scale back to a 4-day program in September due to schedule constraints, but I'll do everything I can to stick with the full 5-day split. I also do moderate intensity cardio on lifting days if there's enough time after the workout to grab a book and hop on a bike or elliptical before the gym closes. All of my past routines included a *lot* of cardio in addition to the splits outlined below, usually targetting a heart rate around 155 (max heart rate 200). I do all of my reading on cardio machines, and I am an avid reader. I'm a part-time student that reads textbooks in full, in addition to my personal readings. I've spent close to 4 consecutive hours on an elliptical machine while reviewing a text for an exam. **June 2012 - July 2012 Routine**   For my first six weeks, I worked with a personal trainer, following a Push-Pull-Legs split, with core exercises at the end of every workout. Fittit loves to hate on personal trainers, but while many of the trainers I've seen at Goodlife Fitness gyms have been rubbish, this was a positive experience for me. The trainer had some bodybuilding experience, and provided a lot of help in learning good form and balanced programming. I definitely got off to a better start than I otherwise would have without him - I would have educated myself eventually, but with the mindset I had at the time, I most likely would have ended up doing machines only with an over-emphasis on chest and arms. **August 2012 - February 2013**   My grip started to falter towards the end of my Pull day (by the end of the workout I had a hard time closing my left hand), so I put together my own 4-day split to divvy up the pulls a bit more. I also alternated between a week focused more on free weights, and a week focused more on heavier weights with machines (though neither week was entirely free weight or entirely machine). My approach probably wasn't ideal, and it's certainly not what I'd do if I was starting over again. **Tuesday:** Arms   **Thursday:** Shoulders, Abs, a *little* chest   **Saturday:** Legs, Obliques   **Sunday:** Chest, Back, Abs   I made a lot of progress during this period, because Newb Gains, but it was undoubtedly the worst-programmed routine that I've followed. **March 2013 - August 2013; December 2013 - April 2014**   I became a Redditor in late 2012, and found Fittit some time after. I was looking for a new routine, so I looked at the Fittit FAQ for suggestions. I settled on a variant of the 4-day upper/lower split [Muscle Building Workout Routine](http://www.aworkoutroutine.com/the-muscle-building-workout-routine/), with the addition of ab work on lower body days. This routine worked very well for me. There was a stretch from the start of September until Xmas when I didn't have time to lift, but otherwise I stuck with it until I switched to PHAT in May of this year. This was also when I completely overhauled my wardrobe and started dressing like a normal person, instead of hiding my physique under a mass of baggy black clothes. ### Body Progress The pictures above should explain my body progress pretty well. The biggest change was clearly in the first year. The second year handed me a considerable setback that I had to dig out of. For over three months at the end of 2013, I simply didn't have the time to lift weights at all. I adjusted my diet for the reduced activity, but failed to track my weight to gauge whether I set my calorie budget correctly. Apparently I did not, and ended up losing about 6 lbs. I spent a large chunk of the winter recovering lost progress. I had a lot of all-nighters and nights with only an hour or two of sleep over those months, and lack of rest probably slowed my progress further. I was able to add some mass before it was time to cut for the summer, but well short of my target. Since my initial fat loss, my body weight peaked at about 132 lbs this May. Since then, I cut slightly down to 129 lbs. I've been maintaining that weight for the summer, and have managed to very slightly drop body fat percentage while holding total mass steady. I'll refocus on gaining mass again soon. I don't like to call it bulking, because I prefer to gain in a very slow, controlled manner to minimize fat gain. I am nothing if not methodical, so I weigh myself and check my body fat percentage (using a handheld BIA device) first thing every morning. That data is recorded to make sure it's trending in the right direction. Some graphs showing the moving average of those measurements:   * [Graph of mass and lean mass over time](http://i.imgur.com/AZPzcAn.png)   * [Graph of body fat percentage over time](http://i.imgur.com/UWZxlCj.png)   * [Spreadsheet of recoreded measurements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aob8UQ1p9l9ydE1IY1RySmk4RjB6QkZ2QVFvWlRORUE&gid=0) ### Diet I set a calorie budget. Currently it's set at 2800 calories/day to maintain (or very, very slowly cut). I originally tried to set my calorie budget by tracking my activity (including wearing a heart-rate monitor), but that never produced good results. My best results come from adjusting the budget according to the trend it produces in my daily weight measurements. I log everything that I eat, aside from some spices and seasoning that have no or negligible caloric and macronutrient content. I've used a couple different apps for this, but the one I stuck with is [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) for Android. I allow myself a maximum of one dietary cheat day per week. In practice, my cheat days still hit my calorie and macro targets for the day, but hit them with less healthy foods (like Hamburger Helper); the weekly cheat days are just a chance to ignore things like fiber and micronutrient content. Cheat days that disregard my calorie target are very rare. I can remember only three occasions in 2014, one of which was due to a hurricane. I treat my dietary goals as commandments from up on high. I follow them as if Gandalf told me the safety of the One Ring depended on it. This is a [graph of my daily calorie intake](http://i.imgur.com/wyjD1LR.png) over a 90 day period to show the level of consistency that I maintain. I measure servings with a kitchen scale or measuring cup. I don't eyeball or estimate serving sizes (with the exception of peanut butter, because I've measured it so many times already). I adamantly refuse to eat *anything* if I don't have nutritional data for it.   * **Macro split:** I set a minimum of 1g protein and 0.5g of fat per pound of body mass per day, just because they're easy numbers to work with. Other than those minimums, I pay no heed to my macro distribution. I find that a very high protein diet (close to 1.5g/lb or more) helps with satiety and makes it easier to avoid exceeding my calorie budget, but I don't treat that as a rule.    * **Meal timing:** Irrelevant. I avoid having a full stomach during intense workouts, and avoid workouts when I'm starving. Otherwise, I eat when I'm hungry.    * **Supplements used:** Protein shake with breakfast, made with almond milk, one scoop of Optimum Nutrition whey, and one scoop of creatine monohydrate. No other supplements related specifically to workouts. I take multivitamins to avoid potential gaps in my micros, fish oil for [general health benefits](http://examine.com/supplements/Fish+Oil/), and probiotics to avoid the flatulence that my diet otherwise produces.  * **Snacks:** Apples, bananas, Kashi granola bars, and Quest protein bars are my main snack items. Sometimes beef jerky, if I'm patient enough to measure servings. I rely heavily on dry roasted almonds and sunflower seeds as end-of-day snacks to hit my daily target; my meals get me close to the target, then I measure out enough nuts or seeds to bring me within 3 calories of the target.    * **Snacks:** Water. Lots of water. Aside from my morning protein shake, I drink nothing but filtered tap water (filtered so as not to sap and impurify all of my precious bodily fluids). **Common meals**: My diet doesn't vary much from day to day, and there are some things that are pretty much constant every day. * Weekday breakfast: Protein shake, Kashi granola bar; 330 cal, 31g protein, 8g fat, 29g carbs, 4g fiber * Weekday lunch: 200g grilled chicken breast, 500g raw baby carrots, 2 medium bananas, 1 large or 2 small apples, 1 Kashi granola bar, 1 serving of All-Bran Buds with a butterscotch pudding cup; 1191 cal, 37g protein, 20g fat, 188g carbs, 37g fiber * Weekend breakfast: Protein shake, bagel with natural peanut butter (12 whole grain bagel), 1 medium banana, 1 serving All-Bran Buds with butterscotch pudding cup; 805 cal, 43g protein, 19g fat, 123g carbs, 22g fiber And one of my favourites that I don't eat daily, but often enough to consider it a cornerstone of my diet:   * Hamburger: 2 lean beaf patties (I buy pre-made PC Blue Menu) on a thin whole grain bun, natural peanut butter, Montreal steak spice, 1 slice of mozza cheese; 670 cal, 64g protein, 27g fat, 39g carbs, 7g fiber (less if you skip the cheese or PB). Seriously though, whether you're dieting or not, hamburgers need to be doubled up, two patties per bun. It's the only way to eat hamburgers.  ### Personal Challenges My greatest challenge has always been a lack of free time and its corollary, a lack of sleep. I have my full-time day job; I've been working to get a better degree for myself, and as far as student commitments go, *I am fucking hardcore*; I've carefully maintained a course-load that my university considers to be part-time while the government considers me to be a full-time student; I also do part-time consulting work, and the workload for that can vary considerably. All of that adds up to a lot of demands on my time, and not much opportunity to get sleep. I never set out to specifically track my sleep, but I use [Sleep as Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&hl=en) for my alarm clock, and it just so happens to log me sleeping hours and produce [pretty graphs](http://i.imgur.com/x7IBAf6.png). Since I started using the app last year, I've averaged 6.08 hours in bed per night. That's less than ideal, but the bigger problem is how erratic my sleep schedule sometimes is. The deep dips on that graph are nights that I never got to bed, or only got to bed for a couple hours. There are also occasional days where I absolutely crash and sleep for 16 hours or more. I do *not* have healthy sleeping habits, and I'm quite positive that the all-night work sessions are stealing my gains. ### Future Goals I look good naked, but still want to look *better* naked. I'd say that [Steve Cook](https://www.google.ca/search?q=Steve+Cook&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=H-TjU9SLAdOUyASf_oCgDw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1821&bih=902&dpr=0.75) has my [goal physique](http://38.media.tumblr.com/869ec0d0186d6630b6a856e7eb45ef1b/tumblr_n0y8rqGYs51tpda49o1_500.jpg). I'd like to gain about 20 pounds from my current weight while keeping my body fat percentage as low as it is now. Realistically, I think I should be able to gain 10 lbs per year, so another two years could take me there. Then again, I think I've always been aiming for an extra 20 pounds, so maybe I'm eternally cursed to forever want to weigh 20 lbs more.  I don't have many specific goals in mind for lifts. I'd like to be able to bench 2 plates for 5 reps eventually, but at my size, I don't anticipate that happening for quite some time. Now that I'm using straps and don't have my grip holding me back on deadlifts, I'm hoping I can manage to get up to 315x5 before Xmas. ### Other Random Comments * I wear gloves on all of my pushes and pulls except for deadlifts and barbell rows. I like to keep my hands soft and girly, and there's nothing wrong with that. You don't have to tell me that the gloves should match my purse. I think I've already heard that joke from every person who's ever heard Rip say it. Either say something original, or shut up about it. * I'm OK with any and all questions in this thread, so long as the mods are. Worst case scenario is that I'll ignore comments that I don't like. ### Frequently Asked Questions (and Comments) **Question:** How do you keep your calorie counts so consistent?   **Answer:** With nuts, seeds, and a kitchen scale. I eat meals to get *close* to my calorie goal, without going over. Then I measure enough nuts or seeds at the end of the day to cover the remaining calories. My food diary for most days will show something like 8g almonds, or 32g sunflower seeds, etc. 1g is 5.8 calories, which lets me get within 3 calories (+/-) of my goal. **Comment:** Several comments about 'manlet' being a dehumanizing term, sexist, showing a lack of respect, etc. **Answer:** I understand the viewpoint, but I disagree. Tyrion is more eloquent than me, so I'll let him explain why: > Let me give you some advice bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. **Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you**. The word has no connotations other than that which we give it. The LGBT community seems to have reclaimed the word *queer* as a positive term, so why the hell can't short guys reclaim manlet? That's what the Supermanlet moniker is to me. I can cringe at the word 'manlet', I can complain about people using it, or I can take the word, and make it my bitch. I choose the latter. **Question:** Do I recommend a program like PHAT as a starting point? **Answer:** No, I don't. Today, I live to work out, and hitting the gym is the high point of many of my days. If I tried to do high volume lifting 5 days a week, and cardio 2 *before* I developed that passion, I probably would have burned out and given up. It's a generic Fittit answer, but my recommendation for a beginner is to follow StrongLifts until you exhaust your linear gains. After you've done that, and are positive that you'll carry through, then consider whether or not programs like PHAT are right for you. **Question:** Lots of people wondering about the impact fitness has had on my romantic life and sex life. **Answer:** So far, women haven't been throwing themselves at me, and I honestly don't have the time or energy to put into initiating such pursuits myself. I have noticed people of both genders being generally more friendly, and more likely to smile or say hi in passing, and less likely to react negatively when I do the same. That probably has as much or more to do with the confidence that comes with fitness, and possibly also my better attire. **Question:** How many calories did I eat during the initial fat loss, and how long did it take to lose the gut? **Answer:** I wasn't using MFP yet at the time, so I don't have a food diary that far back to verify, and my calorie target at the time varied from day to day depending on my activity for the day. I'm pretty sure that I was generally in the 1800-2200 range on most days. I cut from 137 down to 122 by September. Immediately after that, I accidentally cut an extra 4 pounds down to 118 by getting sick for two weeks. **Question:** People are curious about body hair. **Answer:** Yes, I manscape. I just like the look of it more. I use an electric trimmer. If it looks waxed or shaved, that's just a problem with image quality. I set the blade guard on my trimmer 1mm shorter for my body hair than I do for my beard. **Further to the topic of my beard:** My Riker stays. I know most women don't like it, but their aesthetic preferences are secondary to my own. I like my beard, and plan on keeping it. The beardly naysayers here are like Delilahs to my Samson. **Comments:** People suggesting I'm on steroids or prohormones, and specifically mentioning the back acne. **Answer:** No. I use no supplements other than those I mentioned in the OP. The back acne has been present since my early to mid teens, and is not a result of using gear. It's more visible in the newer pictures than the old due to the lighting and the post-workout skin inflammation in the locker room selfies. I've gained less than 10 pounds of muscle in two years of training. If you think that's indicative of steroid use, then I don't think you have a great understanding of what results natty or geared lifters should expect. ### About This Progress Post Format Created using [the reddit fitness progress tracking post template](https://github.com/cjbarber/FitnessProgressPosts). **Edit:** Added an FAQ for stuff that's come up in comments and PM's.   **Edit 2:** Updated FAQ   **Edit 3:** Updated FAQ again  ",Yeah you're definitely an IT guy; not by looks but by ALL THAT DATA.

2d7zyg,"Hey guys, I've posted a few form checks and questions before, but now i couldn't refrain from  sharing my story and (finally!!!) monumental goal with all of you... I am 21, male, 5'6 and weigh 61kg (~135lbs).   When I was 17 I suffered from [myelitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelitis) which rendered my on a wheelchair for 2  months with paralyzed fingers and toes and severe weakness in my body. Due to this  disease, I had to relearn how to walk, then jog and cycle, and after six months, run.  Since then I have recovered fully, but my shoulders have really bad issues due to my  posture and the weakening of the shoulder muscles. I started going to gym about two  years ago, but never took it seriously, as my muscles were too weak and I was  embarrassed.  Then, January this year I went to the USA on exchange for a semester and started  eating like crazy. I also started lifting, getting serious around March doing stronglifts.  I went from [53kg](http://imgur.com/a/pcHz1#CxHQVbY) (pre bulk) up to [63kg](http://imgur.com/a/pcHz1#CxHQVbY) bodyweight (so much more fat!) and then down to 61kg in 7 months. I now  lift 3-4 times a week doing a modified linear progression workout - Squat + Bench on  Monday, Deadlift + OHP Wednesday, Squat + Bench Friday and sometimes  Saturday, switch every second week, with weighted dips and chins as accessories. I also just started HIIT cycling twice a week to get rid of some of the fat I have been building. Today I achieved a personal goal of 100kg squat for 1 rep, barefoot, low bar and was  told it was 'good form' by the gym instructor. I don't have a video of this achievement,  but here is [92.5kg x3] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDC7f3KgAUc&feature=youtu.be) I did two weeks ago. I have been working on form strictly for  two weeks, so I improved anything I could see wrong with that lift. My other lifts are:  50kg overhead press x5 75kg bench x5 115kg deadlift x3 My diet consists of 2500-3000 calories a day. Every day I have Eggs, tuna, LOTS of low fat milk (lactose intolerance), chicken or tofu, and lots of fruit and veges, plus protein shake or bar on lifting days.  My Next goal is now to get 150 deadlift and 65kg body weight.   I really wanted to thank this community for getting me interested in lifting, and being  supportive. I hope that my story is just one of many that goes to show, even when  things are looking really really down (even to the point of temporary paralysis) and  you doubt yourself, you can still achieve your goals.  Edit: wow this blew up! I really appreciate the positive feedback from everyone. I know I have a lot work to do still with my form, but im sure I'll get there! To all of you who are struggling with your own personal setbacks, that shit passes.. Stay positive and motivated! ","This is crazy impressive. But in the interests of safety and seeing as no one else wants to be that asshole: you may want to adjust your squat form a little more. Your back appears to round significantly and you shoot your hips up a little quickly, causing you to goodmorning the weight up the last part of the squat.  ",149
2dzjrs,What the heck is up with dad muscle? Are dad gains permanent? He's like 56 and still way stronger than me even though I work out. You guys know what I'm talkin' about.,"Lifting weights, yes. Miscellaneous feats of strength, no.",2195
2eh0r2,"[Before and after](http://imgur.com/a/3Ed4r) **Measurements**  Bust: 41.5” -> 32” Waist: 33” -> 23” Hips: 45” -> 33” Thighs: 33” -> 17” Biceps: 14”-> 9.2” Calves: 17” -> 12.5”  My weight loss started at 18 when I moved away to university. Armed without the faintest of idea on nutrition, I lost about 40lbs in 2 years by eating less but not healthily. My diet consisted of enough alcohol to float a boat (Uni. Don’t judge) enough coffee to tide me over until it were an acceptable time to drink (1pm. incase you’re wondering) and one solid meal a day because I was usually too lazy and too hungover to stomach much. I don’t advice this at all, obviously.   After finishing uni, I spent the summer feeling sick and run down so I bought a bunch of books on nutrition and eventually decided to go vegan. The transition into vegan was bumpy to begin with as i didn't ease into it, but instead threw myself into the deep end. I spent the first few weeks bewildered at what exactly I could eat that was of substance. So I ordered a few cookbooks and learnt to put together meals. These are some of the cookbooks I recommend for those that are interested: - Easy Vegan by Ryland Peters & Small - Vegan Feats by Rose Elliot - Honestly Healthy by Natasha Corrett - Harumi’s Japanese Cooking - Skinny Bitch by Kim Barnouin - Sweet vegan (for dessert recipes)  As requested, some tips for those looking to keep it as inexpensive as possible: - Beans, nuts, legumes, rice and grains are fantastic staples and also very cheap to buy. Buy in bulk if that’s available to you. - Local ethnic shops tend to sell the aforementioned staples for a lot less than chain supermarkets so pay them a visit and support a local business at the same time. - Forgo the supermarkets in favor of farmers markets or weekend market stalls. Depending on where you live and what’s available, this can shave off over 2/3rds from your weekly fruit and veg shop.  - Frozen vegetable are just as good as fresh so stock up  Since then I have dropped the remaining 30lbs and built a decent amount of muscle. I’m very lucky not to have been left with any loose skin. Probably because I lost the weight over a long period of time and that I moisturize religiously, drink a ton of water and also my age.  Inner thighs and back of arms still feel a bit squidgy but overall nothing too noticeable.   **Diet** I keep an 80/20 balance. 80% healthy and 20% indulgent. A sample of my daily intake looks something like this: Breakfast: Big bowl of fruit along with granola and almond milk. Snack: handful of almonds and walnuts Lunch: Salad consisting of black beans, salad leaves, butternut squash, pumpkin seeds and a splash of avocado oil and lemon juice Snack:  banana Dinner: Vegetable stir fry.  Dessert: dark chocolate.  I like to keep it as natural as possible and I’m not a fan of soy products because protein on a vegan diet is pretty easy to get with some proper planning. I total at about 2500 calories because I workout 6 days a week and I’m fairly active outside of work.   Alcohol: I obviously don’t drink nearly as much as I used to because I’m a grownup laydeee and stuff. Nowadays, it’s no more than 5 drinks a week and yes, along with the occasional blowout, I’m not gonna lie (once a month, if that) **Drinks**: 3litres of water daily, one americano in the morning, 2 cups of black tea and 2-3 cups of green tea throughout the day. No energy drinks or fizzy drinks.   **Macros**:  C45- F20-P35 I stay as close to this as possible. After a couple of years of fiddling with the ratio (with 80/10/10 being the worst by far) this is what works for me.   **Supplements**: I avoid vegan protein powders (soy, pea etc.) because they taste like ass and I’ve yet to find one that I can tolerate.  I only take a daily Vitamin D tablet (5000IU) in the autumn and winter and a weekly b12 (25ug). I get annual bloods done and everything is within the healthy range.   **Exercise** When I went vegan, I also took up running, which was great and I loved it but soon noticed that it wasn’t really doing anything to change the shape of my body but instead was just shrinking it and so for a long time I had that skinny-fat look. Eventually, I incorporated boxing and pilates and that definitely helped to strengthen my core and give me a bit more definition.  Real change didn’t start to happen until 6 months ago. One of the trainers at my gym has the most incredible butt, mid-forties and in better shape than 99% of people my age. So after months of just ogling her arse like a creep, I asked her what the hell it is she does to get such a glorious behind and she introduced me to the area of the gym I’d avoided like the plague: yes, the weights. Since then, I’ve been doing a mix of bodyweight exercises (pushups, situps, planks, dips, donkey kicks) and weight exercises (squats, deadlifts, lunges, glute bridges, kettlebell swings, Russian twists, overhead press, curls)  I do my weight and bodyweight workouts 6 days a week, alternating lower and upper body days (Monday: upper, Tuesday: lower, Wednesday: upper etc.) along with either a boxing class, a 3-5 mile run or a yoga class.  Like everyone else, it’s still a work in progress and I’m working towards lifting heavier weights.    **TL;DR** Before: fat & drunk. After: smaller and sometimes drunk. ---------------------- **Edit 1**: added a lot more info and thank you guys for all your lovely words! However, do stop pm'ing for webcam shows.

2frftj,"When I was trying to figure out how I wanted to go about cutting, this sub was instrumental.  I love reading about other's routines, diets, and ideas and I particularly enjoy the transformation/progress posts!  You fine people are awesome and your contributions helped me immensely!  Here is my first experience with cutting which lasted 5 months.    **Pics**   (Anytime body weight is mentioned it is an average weight for that week)   April 2014 - 185 lbs [end of dirty bulk/start of cut](http://imgur.com/a/MidPY)   August 2014 - 151 lbs [end of cut](http://imgur.com/a/MafJF)   [Sept 5, 2014 - 155 lbs](http://imgur.com/a/D7WTq) **Lift numbers**  (all 1RM in lbs, tested throughout the month of August 2014) SQUAT:  315   BENCH: 225   DEADLIFT: 385   OHP: 155   That god damn 4-plate deadlift eludes me :( **The Routine** **TUESDAY**   Squat 5x5   OHP 5x5   Front Squat 5x5   **WEDNESDAY**   Bench press 5x5   DB bench press 3x6   DB incline 3x6   Weighted dips 3x8   Tricep pull downs 3x10   **THURSDAY**   Deadlift 5x5   Pendlay rows 5x5   DB rows 3x8    Long pull rows 3x8   bicep curl 21's x3   Farmer walks   **FRIDAY**   Push jerk! 5x5 - This has become my favorite lately!   Low catch power cleans with ATG front squat finish 5x5   Upright row 3x10   Shoulder press on machine 3x10 **SUNDAY**   Weighted pushups 5x20   Pullups 5x10   Weighted bench dips 3x20   Chinups 5x10   Weighted diamond pushups 3x10 (all weighted workouts are with a backpack filled with 40lbs of books) **Rest on Saturdays and Mondays**   *I did ab/core iso workouts about six times towards the end of my cut, usually on a Monday. Ab workout   5 station circuit x 3 revolutions   cable crunches   mason twists with 12 lb med ball   cable crunches   weighted planks (35lbs for 60 seconds)   cable crunches   **LOL cardio and calves!!**   **Some noteworthy facts relevant to calorie deficit:**   At a bw of 185 lbs and setting my exercise level at 5 times per week-intense, [iifym.com](http://iifym.com) calculated my TDEE at 2700 kcal.  For the full duration of the cut I ate at 2000 kcal.  Understanding TDEE goes down as body weight goes down, I never adjusted for it.  Also, I'm a single dad.  I have sole custody of my two toddler girls, ages 2 and 3.  Unfortunately, iifym.com cannot calculate the calorie burn this kind of task accounts for but I can tell you it is SUBSTANTIAL.  Wrangling two nuggets on a daily basis (in a two-story townhouse mind you) at times makes deadlifting seem like a vacation.  Judging by how fast the excess weight came off, I'm certain I was eating at a much larger deficit than 700 kcal, but I can't really say how much.  At only 10 weeks in, I was down 22 lbs.  [Here I am at week 10 of the cut at 163 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/LDCQvsm.jpg)(with a post workout pump and under bad lighting) **DIET**   2000 kcal per day   Macro goals were 35%protein, 35%fat, 30%carbs   175g protein   78g fat   150g carbs   **Breakfast, lunch, and snacks nearly every monday-friday throughout the cut looked like this:**   egg salad (three whole eggs, 1 tbsp canola mayo, mustard, tobasco)     1/2 cup cottage cheese   6 oz turkey breast sandwich     1.25 cup plain greek yogurt   3 oz turkey breast    25 baby carrots   Dinner varied greatly.  I really enjoy cooking and used my remaining 1000 kcal dinner allowance on a wide variety of tasty shit.  Usually one of the following:   10 oz grilled teriyaki chicken thighs with jasmine rice and stir fry veggies   Eggs, egg white, and MorningStar soy sausage patty breakfast bowl topped with colby jack and grilled onions   12 oz wok seared sweet and sour chicken breast with garlic brown rice   Two 5 oz mahi-mahi fish burgers   Fish tacos with 8 oz of cod and pan fried skin on potatoes   Homemade philly steak and cheese made with 10 oz of petite sirloin steak   Two PB & J sandwiches and 2 cups plain greek yogurt! For those extra lazy days!   Beer braised, lime and salsa slow cooker chicken breast made into burritos   Southwest chicken breast quesadillas using 10 oz chicken breast   Two 1/4 lb homemade angus burgers   **Hydration and supplements**   I drank around 64 oz of water daily but primary liquid was diet soda and zero cal energy drinks.  I drank a TON of that stuff.  Fresca, Diet 7up, white Rockstars and blue Monsters.   I take the Kirkland brand Performance Multivitamin daily.  I supplemented with Myprotein Impact Whey (cookies and cream!) just a handful of times when I was low on protein for the day.     I ended my cut during the 2nd week of August 2014 and bumped my intake up to 2300 kcal.  I promptly went from 151 lbs to 155 lbs and have stayed there since.  I fought relentlessly to keep my lift numbers from declining.  I initially took a big hit on bench press and deadlift and was able to gradually climb back.  Squat is the only lift that stayed stable throughout and actually made a slow increase.   From here I will continue eating at 2300 kcal and focus on programming for strength.   **EDIT**   I can't thank all of you enough for the kind words! And the gold! Thanks so much! I'm completely floored!   I'm absolutely humbled to provide any sort of motivation for anyone looking to do something similar.  Reading other people's submissions about their progress and ideas was critical to my own motivation.    I'm currently at work and it's taking every bit of will power to stay off reddit right now but I really look forward to replying to as many comments as I can when I get some free time tonight.

This is an update from a progress post I submitted earlier this year you can find here: [My 3 year transformation from clinically obese (class II) to ripped. My journey from 240lbs to 170lbs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/21yvse/my_3_year_transformation_from_clinically_obese/)  Orginal TL;DR: [Before](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/wDZdndH.jpg)  Update TL;DR: [Before](http://i.imgur.com/XSjWpJD.png) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/D15qGfC.jpg)  Stats: Male 5’10” 26 years old 162lbs Before moving on, I want to thank everyone for the tremendous support I received on my last post. Initially I had done it to track my own progress and, lets be honest, get some acknowledgment for my hard work. What I got instead was an overwhelming amount of love and support that kept me going while I faced what turned out to be a very trying time of my life. I am truly grateful [/r/Fitness](http://reddit.com/r/Fitness), more than I can express here. The purpose of this post is primarily to give thanks. The information in this post was obtained with the help of a coach whom I hired(very expensive). I want to pay your kindness back by giving you this information freely(and there is A LOT of it). I also received many messages and comments asking for updates on my continued progress. I can’t let you guys down! Here we go...   **The surgery and recovery from** * March 25th 2014 I went into surgery to remove excess skin I had accumulated from being as obese as I had been and losing the weight(240lb to 170lb). The most difficult part of the process was the recovery from the procedure. This is a picture of me [before](http://i.imgur.com/XSjWpJD.png) and [after](https://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg) surgery. * In the post surgery picture you’ll notice tubes leading to a bulb. This is a [surgical drain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drain_(surgery)) this was incredibly disturbing to me. * I got the drain removed after about three weeks but the swelling didn’t subside for about a month and a half. This swelling looked like stomach fat to the untrained eye(myself included) and caused a great deal of stress in my life. After All, I had spent the last 3+ years dieting to get rid of this fat and now it looked like it was back and I was bed bound. * In my last post I didn’t show any pictures of my loose skin because I was ashamed of it.  Here is a picture of a relatively [lean me with my flap of loose skin](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png) **The recovery from this surgery got dark man** * The inability to exercise affected me much more dramatically than I had anticipated. I became deeply depressed and was consumed with feelings of hopelessness. I thought with certainty that I had lost all progress made in the gym and through my diet. * Without the support I received from r/Fitness, private messages, encouraging comments etc. I might have taken a darker path than the one I took. So again, thank you guys. **Competing in Men’s Physique** * When I was recovered enough to get back in the gym, I decided I needed a solid goal to dedicate my time and energy towards and having gotten my excess skin removed I could finally take my shirt off in front of people. I registered for a bodybuilding competition to compete in Men’s Physique. * I hired my coach midway through June with the competition on Oct. 4, 2014. This gave me about 16 weeks to prep for the event, which I’ve heard is a reasonable amount of time for a natural competitor. * Having only started training with purpose in Sept. 2013, I knew this was an ambitious goal but one which I still feel is achievable.   **Contest prep** **The diet** * My coach is an old school bodybuilder who believes very strongly in bro tactics such as small meals every two hours and morning cardio. I personally have found great success with flexible dieting(counting macros). For this experience though, I decided to put aside my own notions and give myself fully to the program prescribed. * I’m eating six small meals of primarily tilapia and brown rice. I have egg yolks in my first meal for fat content and a cup of green veggies with all six meals. Being that this is a meal plan, knowing the macros doesn’t do anything for me but since I’m so macro-conscious I figured them out. The macros come out to 45 fat, 145 carb and 225 protein.  For those curious, here is my exact meal plan: - Meal one: 4 egg yolks, 2 egg whites, ½ cup(40g dry) oats, 1 cup(85g) fibrous veggies(green beans, broccoli, spinach) - Meal two: 6oz tilapia, ½ cup oats or ⅔ cup(120g cooked) brown rice, 1 cup fibrous veggies - Meal three: 6oz tilapia, ½ cup oats or ⅔ cup brown rice, 1 cup fibrous veggies - Meal four: 6oz tilapia, ½ cup oats or ⅔ cup brown rice, 1 cup fibrous veggies - Meal five: 6oz tilapia, 1 cup fibrous veggies - Meal six: 6 egg whites **The training & cardio** - My coach has me doing six days on, one day off. These days are split up into arms/push/pull/legs/push/pull. We are doing weak-point training with an emphasis on arms and chest. Both of my push days begin with a chest movement and end with a shoulder movement. I am working biceps and triceps on my arm day and again lightly on the second day of it's complimentary movement eg. push: triceps, pull: biceps. - I'm doing three days of moderate intensity steady-state cardio for 45min(walking hilly roads) and two days of 20min HIIT sessions. The introduction of cardio brought with it substantial weight loss that has since slowed down. Before we began this prep I was doing little to no cardio. **The results** - The most impressive part of this show prep for me is the constant progress. Dieting on my own program I will sometimes stop seeing progress and then attribute the lack of progress to something outside of my control. With another person handling my diet and training, we have a more objective look and thus we break through any plateau very quickly. - I started this cut hovering right below 180lbs. In this picture, I had already begun the diet two weeks prior. [Here I am 175lbs] (http://i.imgur.com/OSxwa6n.jpg) - In the last picture (175lbs) I was roughly 10% body fat according to caliper testing. I was pretty lean already. [This is me at 165lbs(6% bodyfat) after five more weeks of dieting] (http://i.imgur.com/34KiTFB.jpg). - Only two weeks have passed since the last image(165lb). [Here I am today at 162lb] (http://i.imgur.com/D15qGfC.jpg). Selfies: [Front](http://i.imgur.com/Awuki1y.jpg) and [Back](http://i.imgur.com/BDYthv8.jpg). Bonus: [picture of my scar](http://i.imgur.com/QGRudO6.jpg)  **Routine and lifts** - The combination of taking time off to recover from surgery and then going into a cut has taken a toll on my strength. I’m not focused too much on moving these numbers at the moment. Per my coaches instructions: I am exercising my muscles, not annihilating them. This strategy is becoming more important as I get leaner and lower calorie in order to reduce risk of injury. [My current routine as prescribed by my coach](http://i.imgur.com/RETZq1B.png) My numbers: Squat: 295lb 1-3 rep max Bench: 225lb 1 rep max Dead: 365lb (unwilling to test max) OHP: 135lb 1 rep max  .  **I’m still clean and sober and I’m still stupid happy :-)**. The things I’ve achieved in this journey, freedom from obesity and drug addiction, have shown me that I am capable of great things. The only thing ever holding me back is me. When I allow myself to live in fear of the unknown I become paralyzed. The hardest part is just getting started, after that the rest is easy. Dedicating my life to health and wellness is what I needed to recover from obesity and drug/alcohol dependence. By no means am I fully recovered. Everyday I struggle with urges to binge on unhealthy foods or ingest illicit substances. The difference is, now I’m able to recognize that all those things, whether cupcakes or vodka, are just an attempt by myself to change the way I feel using something outside of me. The happiness I’ve found has all come from things I’ve done for myself, not to myself.  Thanks again for this r/Fitness  .  **Details and continuation:** My competition is the [2014 Iron Man Naturally](http://i.imgur.com/8xgnev7.jpg) and is held just north of Seattle, Washington in Bothell, Washington.

2j255e,How to Eat Chicken Without Wanting to Kill Yourse…: http://youtu.be/Px7Uc2GrnhE,"Former line cook here: good lord - you guys need some help. The best way to make chicken breast taste good and not get bored is to use varying spice rubs. Go to the grocery store and buy all of the following: onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, oregano, thyme, rosemary, black pepper, celery salt, lemon pepper, (montreal seasoning), (curry powder). Pretty much all of these can be mixed together except the ones in parentheses, which should be used alone. Mix some spices in a bowl, add a drop of vegetable oil just to make a paste, and rub your chicken down (be sure to add salt if not already present in a spice blend). Bake or cook in a pan. You can make this new every time or make up a batch of your favorite combos when you find one you really like, but switch it up so you always have variety.  Thyme, oregano, rosemary, and lemon pepper make nice herb chicken which is made even better by squeezing fresh lemon over. Paprika, chili, thyme, garlic powder, and onion powder make a decent cajun rub. No added calories, will never go bad, and will last you a year probably. EDIT: formatting UPDATE: Wow, so many good points of advice below! To summarize some of them: 1.) save money buy buying spices in ""ethnic"" stores such as bodegas and Indian food stores. 2.) Baking chicken wrapped in tin foil is a pretty fail-proof way to keeping it juicy. The more practice you get cooking, the more you can pull off grilling and sauteeing chicken. 3.) So many more seasonings in this world too (cumin, fennel, garam masala, Lawry's, Old bay, etc.) 4.) You don't need to do anything fancy to keep chicken moist, just don't overcook it. Happy chicken cooking/eating!",1112
2ku9i8,"So I posted this on r/loseit and r/fitness Today is my cake day and I thought I would reflect on what made me create this account in the first place, two years ago. I had reached my halfway point in my weight-loss journey, back when my goal weight was 150 lbs.  Here is a picture of me at my highest weight. I was 9 months pregnant (though you would never be able to tell) with my daughter. I don't know what my weight was at. I wouldn't let the doctor tell me anymore, but I'd guess I was at or close to around 300 lbs, at 5'5”  http://imgur.com/rq7bacF 3 months after I gave birth to my daughter I weighed in at 270 lbs. Here is the picture someone took of me that made me realize I had to get my shit together. http://imgur.com/MicopmA I'll go into it more if people are curious (though I didn't want to focus on it too much with the initial post) but I lost 110 lbs through mild cardio and calorie counting, and somewhere along the way developed bulimia and had to be hospitalized and almost died.  http://imgur.com/nq3eWdk  When I got out of the hospital I was too afraid to diet and exercise. I was the only parent my daughter had, and I was afraid she would become an orphan. So instead of dieting or just being normal and healthy, I went back to my over-eating ways and a year later, this was me all over again.  http://imgur.com/AK9Muz1 So after a year being recovered, I worked with my therapist and doctors and started losing weight again. This time the right way. The first 60 lbs I lost was just through calorie counting (this as when I made my reddit account). Then I did 20-30 min of cardio 2-4 times a week, mostly walking. Then I started swimming. Then biking. Then running. I was vegetarian for a while. Then vegan. Then I did Keto a little, then I did maybe 5-6 other things I can't remember anymore. All the while I always counted calories. These days I pretty much just count calories and try and get around 100 g of protein a day and that’s pretty much it. I started lifting weights a little over nine months ago, and this is my progress from month 0-6 (though the before picture is from a year before I started lifting) http://imgur.com/raEKCSb and here is a picture taken of me at 9 months of lifting (though I don't see much of a difference between 6 and 9 months, even though my strength has gone up.) http://imgur.com/rhxwSzR My one rep max lifts are Bench – 110 lbs Dead-Lift – 190 lbs Squat – 200 lbs (at parallel)  WARNING: If loose skin grosses you out, you might not want to click on the next two links Here is an album of my “muscles” from 6 months of weight lifting. http://imgur.com/a/PA063 I also documented my loose skin retraction on my midsection (just because SO MANY people had questions about it and there is hardly any information out there) http://imgur.com/F4TpOpf  I have not lost weight in over 18 months, but have gone from a size 8 to a size 4 due to the strength training. I am currently at 138 lbs at 5'6”. Guess what? I GREW AN INCH. My doctor told me that he often sees people get taller as they lose large amounts of weight because their spine becomes less compressed. Crazy right? My shoe size also went down.  I still eventually want to hit my new goal weight of 130, but obviously I'm in no hurry to get there. I have a really bad shoulder that I have dislocated dozens of times and am now looking to get surgery to fix it, and the doc says I might not be able to lift for 6 months because of it. This is something I have cried about multiple times in the past 2 weeks.  Anyway, that's me in all my raw glory. I'm proud of myself. Excited to see where I am next cake-day. Here's some random extra pictures.  http://imgur.com/a/wI4SF    EDIT: Aww shit, obligatory ""thanks for the gold"" edit. Thanks guys, you all are so amazing. You made my night.

That's just how much I love foam rollers. **What is a foam roller? How does it work?** A foam roller is a self massage tool. During a deep tissue massage, someone typically kneads their fingers/palms/elbows into you and it feels good... right?  Well, instead of someone massaging you, you roll over this cylinder and the pressure of your own bodyweight helps to get the knots out and relax your muscles. So, that's why I have one.

2lfle5,"4 years ago I was in a very bad car accident. I rolled my car and got thrown out about 100 feet. I broke 27 bones on impact including 9 vertebrae, near every rib, sternum, and many others. I left the hospital with screws drilled in my back, thumb, and knees. I was given a slim chance to ever live a normal life with the injuries I sustained, but through years of physical therapy and dedication, I began to workout. I never gave up and maintained perseverance to get where I am today.  6 foot male, age 23 130 pounds [then](http://imgur.com/a/H8ong) 200 pounds [now](http://imgur.com/a/2GzO6) Edit: You guys are super awesome.

I'm answering all the questions I can now. But since a lot of you guys are asking, no I wasn't wearing my seatbelt. I was completely sober driving down to help my grandmother out in Florida a few weeks after my grandfather had passed. I was driving on a two lane highway in Arcadia FL and for some reason took my belt off to grab something from the backseat probably forgetting to put it back on. I was going around a bend and all of a sudden I noticed that a white GMC was in the middle of the road and we were going to collide. I yanked the wheel right to avoid them (I was in an old range rover, so it was incredibly top heavy), and over corrected left. This caused my vehicle to tilt and begin to barrel roll that would have made peppy fucking proud. I didn't hit my head (that hard) during the ejection or landing so I remember being shot out, hitting the ground and laying there, and trying not to pass out as I laid there bleeding. A short while later the paramedic called a chopper in and said that they barely got to me in time, They flew me to a level 2 trauma center in Fort Meyers, FL where they proceeded to look at me, call my family, and basically ask them how fast they could drive down here because I didn't have much time and they wanted them to be able to say goodbye. I remember vague dreams of always fighting, never giving in to the pain because deep down inside I knew to quit was to die. I had punctured my left lung 3 times, My right 2 times, my spleen was taken out along with half my liver, and sustained cardiac arrest twice, once leaving my without a heartbeat for a minute and a half. I even fought so hard in the ICU that at one point in shock I ripped my chest tubes out (don't do that). The doctors to this day though say that because of my perseverance and fight is the reason I am alive to day. Grammar.","Props, bro.

2ny75f,"##**PROGRESS**:   **Height:** 5'9'' **Body fat:** 9.2% [220 / 157](http://imgur.com/uDvTum1)  [Face progress](http://imgur.com/mJxiBX9)  [Full two years](http://imgur.com/B5OtkKG)  [Full Yeard, since people keep mentioning it](http://imgur.com/kHByZJx) ----------   For the first eighteen months of this, I was kind of winging it at the gym and just trying to eat right to the best of my ability. I plateaued at ~175 lbs and couldn't seem to make much more progress. It was then that I began seriously reading these forums and discovered all types of things involving nutrition and fitness; most importantly, counting calories. I decided I wanted my abs to be visible. I learned that for this to be possible, a body fat of ~10% or less was required. So in June, I downloaded MyFitnessPal and began counting my calories. It was also then that I adopted a vegan ""diet"", at first for nutritional benefits, and now for all sorts of reasons.    My average caloric intake over this period ranged from 1,500 to 2,300 per day; I was experimenting for the first three months or so. Now it seems as though 1,800 - 2,000 allows me to lose the amount of fat that I'm comfortable with. Here are my most current dietary goals:   ----------   ##**DIET**   **CALORIES PER DAY:** 1,800*   * Protein: ~110g * Carbs: ~300g * Fat: ~70g * *Calories per day was my goal with cardio included. I am realizing the macros don't add up.*   ###**FREQUENT FOODS**   Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks weren't planned whatsoever. I would pretty much just eat throughout the day whenever I was hungry. The key was sticking to reasonably low calorie foods and keeping the cheat meals at a minimum:   * Cereal * Bananas * Baked beans * Boca burgers * Gardein products * Tofurkey products * NuGo protein bars * White or brown rice * Lightlife smart dogs * Steam-in-bag vegetables * Soy, almond, coconut, and flax milk   ###**CHEATING:**   * Whiskey * Craft beer * Taco Bell (I know) * Diet soda (not really a cheat, but kept my sanity) ###**SUPPLEMENTS:**   * Creatine * Beta Alanine * Various types of soy, rice, pea, and hemp protein powders   ----------   ##**EXERCISE**   I've been doing PPL (Push/Pull/Legs) for the last seven weeks, with this last one consisting of a deloading phase. Here are my daily routines for the first six weeks:   **MONDAY:**   *PUSH (chest / shoulders / triceps)*   * Bench: 195 lbs (5x5) * Shoulder Press: 90 lbs (5x5) * Tricep Pulldown: 60 lbs (5x5) * 1-3 mile run * Abs (ab roller, planks)   **TUESDAY:**   *CARDIO*   * 3-6 mile run   **WEDNESDAY:**   *PULL (back / biceps)*   * Deadlift: 175 lbs (5x5) * Chin Ups: Body weight (5x5) * Cable Row: 100 lbs (5x5) * Dumbbell Alternate Curls: 40 lbs (5x5) * 1-3 mile run * Abs (ab roller, planks)   **THURSDAY:**   *CARDIO*   * 3-6 mile run   **FRIDAY:**   *LEGS (quads / hams / calves)*   * Squat: 155 lbs (4x6) * Calf Raise: 245 lbs (4x6) * Dumbbell Lunges: 40 lbs (3x10) * Abs (ab roller, planks)   **SATURDAY:**   * OFF   **SUNDAY:**   *CARDIO*   * 3-6 mile run   ----------   ##**REFLECTIONS, LESSONS LEARNED, & ADVICE**   To be brief, there are two very specific things that influenced my change and neither of them involve fitness. If you care to know, they are the films of [Terrence Malick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Malick) and the music of [Tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_%28band%29), specifically ""[Lateralus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralus)"".   I mention those unrelated influences to highlight the fact that a desire for a ""nice body"" isn't necessarily a prerequisite to significant physical, mental, or emotional health. I wanted my *life* to improve. Those two things were my conduit, but I soon did realize that my health would eventually need to improve at least *somewhat* for me to be comfortable. Hell, my original goal weight was 185! When I reached that, I kept going. I felt a hunger and addiction because the results were tangible and I could feel myself changing in every single way, all for the better.   In reading these forums, the one thing I've taken away is this: *Do not believe everything you read here or anywhere else*. There are absolutely wonderful things here, especially in the FAQ, and certainly from various posts I've read over the last six months; but do not believe or adhere to any one thing. *Experiment* with your own body. Do not be discouraged if something is working wonderfully for someone but doesn't seem right for you. It's incredibly discouraging to strive so hard at something and fail miserably. I will tell you that I've tried countless different exercises and routines (both dietary and physical) and am just now starting to figure my body out.    A long time ago I read someone say, ""Anyone who has exercised for less than five years is a beginner."", and I called complete bullshit on that statement. Now, though, two years into this myself, I am starting to see his point. Your body is so complex that it's utterly mind-boggling. So many people want such a quick fix. It simply doesn't work that way. It takes effort. It takes time. It takes dedication. If you allow these three things to work in conjunction with one another, you *will* see and feel results. ----------   ##**MOVING FORWARD**   This week I have started a 'clean, slow' bulk. That is to say, I'm eating 250 cals above maintenance, upping my protein, and following P.H.U.L. (Power-Hypertrophy-Upper-Lower). My plan is to do this for three months, cut back down for three more, and see what I've managed to accomplish. I have never been more excited about any aspect of my life than I am for these next six months. Although it was not the original spark, fitness has absolutely changed my life. Thanks for reading. ---------- ##**VALUABLE TOOLS:** * [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) - Set your dietary goals, track your calories, and see results over time. * [MapMyRun](http://www.mapmyrun.com/) - Track your running stats, set goals, participate in challenges. You can sync this with MyFitnessPal and it will automatically deduct your calories accordingly. * [JEFIT](http://www.jefit.com/) - Find and/or create your own lifting routines. Allows for graphs and charts to track your progress. ---------- ##**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS & COMMENTS:** * **""Do you have trouble getting protein being a vegan?""** *No.* * **""Juice!""** *No.* * **""Your lifts look like shit and -insert broism here-""** *My lifts were for maintenance purposes only and were set at very moderate weights accordingly. Most of my focus was on diet and cardio.* * **""Did you drink alcohol?""** *Yes, but put limits on myself. One craft beer per night, tops, with one or two small glasses of whiskey, tops. I plan on cutting it down to the weekends during this bulk.* * **""Do you have loose skin?""** *Yes, but pretty minimal. It is visible when I sit down.* * **""How much could you run when you first started out?""** *For the first month or so I was unable to even run for 10 straight minutes. Consistency is key. I can do a 10k without being remotely winded, now.* * **""Should I do cardio before or after weights?""** *In my experience, absolutely after weights. This does not apply to leg day, though. Don't do that.*",This is some serious progress. Congrats on looking badass at 30. You look like you would lift a lot more than you do. Hopefully your bulk will help fix that. Will this be your first bulk?,619

I know a lot of people don't like these posts and want them relegated to other subreddits, but I got my motivation from /r/fitness and transformation posts were huge for me so if this can motivate one guy/girl like me, then I'll have done my part. I saved this for this time of year, hoping it may motivate some people who are considering a change in 2015. **Quick Bio** TL:DR: Fatty tries and tries again, finally gets the prize. I've been overweight since the middle of high school and really ballooned during college. I've been firmly in the obese category for 5-6 years. I doubt anyone has tried and failed as many diets as I have in that time span. I have archives upon archives of ""before"" pictures. But my struggle can be summed up with the Thomas Edison quote (I know all the Tesla/Edison stuff-I'm only supporting a theory behind a quote, not a man): when asked how he felt about his 1,000 failed attempts to create the light bulb, Edison reportedly replied ""I haven't failed 1,000 times, I've found 1,000 ways NOT to make a light bulb"". Whether this is a true story or not, the mentality behind it is true. If you've tried time and time again, you have not failed-you have learned ways that don't work for you. Change something, anything, and try again. You only have to get it right once to change your life. I'd like to say I saw what I had become, had a moment of clarity where the sun shined down on me and I changed then and there, but the truth is, that had happened many times and it always wore off. It is the continued daily effort that gets the job done-not the sudden surge of inspiration or motivation. **Quick Breakdown of My Transformation** TL:DR: Caloric deficit every single day for 5 months straight, typical day < 1,500 calories + 1 hour exercise. 103.8 pounds in 5 months. For the past 5-6 years, my goal has been to get under 200 pounds. On 06/01/2014, I stepped on the scale right at midnight and looked down to see that I weighed the most I've ever weighed in my life: [295.6 pounds](http://i.imgur.com/T4ewQUc.jpg). For 5 months, I focused on being as healthy as I could while taking in less than 1,500 calories per day, and exercising for 1 hour each day. On the morning of 11/01/2014 I stepped back on the same scale and looked down to see that I weighed the least I've ever weighed while 6 feet tall: [191.8 pounds](http://i.imgur.com/wdQHTTE.jpg).  **The TL:DR of my advice** 1. Study and research as much as you can about your goal and how to achieve it. Learn the nutrition, the exercises, the pros and cons of everything. Knowing your stuff is how you avoid putting tons of effort into activities that won't give the results that you're looking for. 2. Study and research yourself. Nutrition and fitness are evolving sciences-we don't know everything about how our bodies work yet (but we know a heck of a lot-see # 1). On top of that, everyone is different to some degree. It may be easier for you to have a cheat day to keep you from breaking down or you may be like me and a cheat day may be counterproductive because it opens you to temptations that are hard to pull back from at the end of it. 3. The ONLY correct diet for weight loss is the one that you stick to. I've lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks, before going back to my old ways more times than I can count. It doesn't matter how great a diet works if you can't stick to it for long enough to reach your goal.  I'm embarrassed to admit I used to see these posts and I was too lazy to read some giant explanation of all kinds of stuff about the lifestyle, life, etc. so I'm intentionally going to break this up into parts. I hope this isn't seen as karma whoring. I obviously couldn't care less about internet points on an alternate account I made specifically for this post. For /r/fitness, I'll obviously break down my workout. I've posted my diet and nutritional goals and mission in my /r/loseit post [(link here)](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2q73l1/male_24_years_old_61_295_to_191_lbs_in_5_months/) and I encourage you to check that out because it is very detailed and took a long time to come up with the diet to meet the needs I wanted to meet. Since my goal was burning fat, I did not get super detailed into specific workouts and exercises. My goal in my workouts for the majority of the transformation was simply to burn calories. For the first month or so I walked. If that's all you can do-don't be ashamed! Go Walk! Walking, and especially power walking, is in my opinion one of the most undervalued things by obese people. They feel like they can't exercise (which is often true in terms of intense workouts) so they don't. You'd be surprised how many calories walking/power walking can burn! Start by walking for your hour of exercise. Then find a way to run for 5 minutes in that hour, then 10 minutes, then 15. I literally started by strolling on a treadmill for an hour and by the end of the 5 months, I was running 5 miles during my hour of exercise. About halfway through my transformation I realized I'd want some sort of body once all this fat fell off, plus I wanted to get my body conditioned for working out so I could make the body I wanted after getting rid of what I didn't want, so I added basic, general workouts. By the end, my routine consisted of 30 minutes of workout including pull ups, pushups, situps, [dumbbell flyes](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/dumbbell-flyes) and curls, then 30 minutes of running. My routine was 30 mins workout, 30 mins run one day, then run the full hour the next day. And repeat. Again-it is important to clearly identify your goal and the best way to achieve it and my goal was fat burning.  I just want to urge you, if you are not who you want to be-it is time, right now to go do it! I intentionally made this post a week before the 1st of the year so you have no excuse-go shopping today, go shopping this weekend, get your routine together-you have 7 days and then you begin, no matter what! People don't plan to fail-they fail to plan! If you ARE who you want to be, if you're knowledgeable about fitness and what it takes, especially if you got that way in part from /r/fitness, stick around the community, help the new guys/girls-explain things, be kind and welcoming. This community was so instrumental in educating and motivating me to become this new person-please keep that up. In closing, thank you /r/fitness for the new me. Please continue to be the community you were for me for others down the road. Questions HIGHLY encouraged!","> The ONLY correct diet for weight loss is the one that you stick to. I've lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks, before going back to my old ways more times than I can count. It doesn't matter how great a diet works if you can't stick to it for long enough to reach your goal. This right here. I wish more people understood this.",664

Smooth album: http://imgur.com/a/CpLMc (The gifs are approximately 6mb each so i recommend downloading/watching the old album if you aren't on wifi. It can also take a while to load if you are using RES, clicking the imgur link will be faster.) Old album: http://imgur.com/a/476PX I made this album for people who are new to the Limber 11 routine or forgot how you are supposed to do a certain stretch.   If you are new to the routine I recommend watching the whole video on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSSDLDhbacc). Joe explains a lot about the purpose of the stretches and how you should perform them.   If you never did any mobility work before please try this out. It is very beneficial to your compound lifts and it will keep your lower body flexible which is never a bad thing.   ~~The gifs don't have a perfect loop but i think they will be good enough for this purpose.~~ Edit: I forgot to add the number of reps/hold for each stretch: The Limber 11: 1. Foam Roll IT Band: 10-15 passes  2. Foam Roll Adductors: 10-15 passes  3. SMR Glutes (lax ball): 30sec. - 2min.  4. Bent-knee Iron Cross x 5-10 each side 5. Roll-overs into V-sits x 10 6.

I used intermittent fasting to achieve this physique. The Leangains method to be exact. Leangains.com has all the information you need to make this transformation. It is basically carb cycling with a 16 hour fast every day. I just concentrated on getting the protein I needed and ensured I was in a caloric deficit. I used a TDEE calculator for this. EDIT: This is the exact URL I followed to structure this diet plan. Follow the links embedded and see how far the rabbit hole takes you. http://rippedbody.jp/2011/10/08/leangains-intermittent-fasting-guide-how-to-do-it-by-yourself/ For workouts I never did cardio and concentrated on compound lifts like bench, squats, pull-ups. I **never** do abs. These abs were achieved from using heavy weights which engage your core. Almost everything you do engages your core so your abs are getting worked every day (squats, bench) **Crunches and situps** ~~do not give you abs~~ are not the key to abs. They may make a small difference overtime. But they really do not add to the overall mass of them. If you want them quick, then engage them with heavy weight.  Achieving this while working at McDonald's taught me that dieting doesn't have to consume your life and nor should it. This shows that you can splurge and look great at the same time. Before you ask, **Yes** I did eat McDonald's food while I worked there. And a lot of it! Nearly every day. My favorite was a Big Mac Double quarter pounder with bacon. That is a Big Mac with quarter pounder meat on it, not the little slivers of meat that come on the original sandwich lol. No their meat doesn't have horse in it and I love their grilled chicken. There are healthy foods to be had at McDonald's and other fast food chains for that matter.  The media destroys these companies when all they are doing is serving food. It is the customers responsibility to choose what they put in their body. At the end of the day it is all about your **caloric intake** and work ethic! P.S.  A McDonald's parfait is not exactly ""healthy"". That is pure sugar. **EDIT:** Wow this is scary. Front Page!? Thanks so much! You guys are awesome! My girlfriend is going to be so mad when she finds out how many people have seen me. **EDIT 2:** No, this is not advertisement by McDonald's Corp. This is just an average guy who surprisingly  found himself on the front page of Reddit. But if anyone knows a guy, who knows a guy in advertisement. I could use some change to get rid of these student loans ;) **EDIT 3:** Getting **a lot** of question so I will try and address a few of them now. I can't possibly answer all of them though, I'm sorry :( I do not know my max in any of my lifts, as I am not a power lifter or interested in the numbers. These pictures were taken over a year ago and I cannot remember what I was using for bench/squats/etc. I remember doing 225 for 8 on bench press a little after this cut. Put that in a one rep max calculator and its says it would be around 285 for my max. Who knows if those work or not. But again I will not try it because the numbers don't interest me. Just to give some of you an idea though, I am currently using 75lb dumbbells for overhead shoulder press, 100lb dumbbells for flat press, squats I do not go over 225. Bad knees run in the family. Had knee surgery in highschool. Pull-ups I tie 45 pound plate to me for added resistance. Workouts: I like to go heavy on the compound movement, usually 8 to 10 reps when wanting to put on size, and reps of 5 when wanting to build strength. I like using strong lifts for building strength. I am a firm believer of working each body part at least twice a week. I like doing upper/lower body splits. Monday upper, Tuesday lower, Wednesday off, Thursday upper, Friday lower. Sat, Sun rest. Though I do not always follow this routine because I like to switch it up, but I always try to work each body part twice a week. I am by no means a professional and do not plan to be. Do what you think is best. This method just worked for me so I wanted to share it. **UPDATE:** No, I do not work at McDonald's anymore. I worked there while completing my Bachelor's Degree and Interning. Currently I am 183 lbs and started a career Information Technology. I continue to lift and plan my next cut in February, and should be done with it in May. Maybe I will see you guys again soon! Thanks for all the support! :) **SHOUT-OUT:** To the Hodgetwins who follow a very similar diet as what I have done here. They are a great YouTube Channel **(TwinMuscleWorkout) (FastingTwins) (Hodgetwins)** and I highly suggest checking them out!

2r1dzs,"Posting this for /u/nefitt  http://youtu.be/NAn7geNYjvE (Just read that I'm allowed to post a video if it's in relation to the transformation, check it out! It summarizes my story :D) Instagram (2016) : @angryeric / www.instagram.com/angryeric http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d A little backstory to this transformation... I've never been that super athletic guy, I always spent countless hours playing video games. When I graduated from high school, I lost nearly all contact with any friends I had from there. I sat in my house playing games for 8-10  hours a day. I was failing at school and quite honestly, I didn't care. I didn't really care about anything, there was no meaning to my life at the time. I was looking at myself every day in the mirror, seeing that I was deteriorating, but once again, I didn't really know what to do. All my self confidence I once had, all my friends I used to have, all my good grades, they'd all disappeared. I was looking through some family pictures (2012-2014) and I could just see the spark I had diminishing progressively. On August 15th 2014, I decided it was time to make a change. I got in contact with a good friend of mine and straight up asked him to take me under his wing (he'd been training for nearly 3 years). He gladly agreed and on August 22nd, I took my first pictures. I'll be listing what I changed, how I changed it, my stats and everything after the pictures. Starting Weight : 210 lbs, 5'11 August 22nd http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d#0 (210 lbs) You can just see the look on my face here, it was one of the first times in a long time that I'd actually dared take off my shirt in front of anyone (my mother & friend took the picture here).  September 17th http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d#1 (~195 lbs) Progress was already being seen, I'd lost about 20 pounds since the start in this picture. Surprisingly enough, it wasn't too difficult to lose these pounds, I just changed some habits (will explain in detail below) October 22nd http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d#2 (~185 lbs) I was down ~15 pounds since the start and was finally starting to re-gain some self confidence. I was much happier and I think the look on my face proves it (compared to the first picture!) November 19th http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d#3 (~180 lbs) At this point, was diet was on pretty much on point, I was doing cardio frequently on my treadmill & I was also lifting quite often (explained below) December 22nd http://imgur.com/a/MAs4d#4 (~176 lbs) December was a huge change for me, I was no longer lifting and doing all this because I wanted to get in shape, I was doing it because I enjoyed it, I loved it. I broke down when looking back at the pictures and the progress. I wondered what I would be right now if I hadn't started all of this. This went from being a small short-term goal to a hobby, a passion.  The gym is now a place where I go to let go, there's nowhere I enjoy being more than the gym. It's like my playground. Now, lets talk about what I changed, how I changed it, my lifts, my frequency, my intensity, etc. DIET & CARDIO On August 15th, I started out by cutting out all forms of junk food (soda, chips, fast food) and started drinking 3L of water daily. When I got hungry, I'd make sure to drink some water and when I was actually hungry (I used to eat out of boredom, so keeping myself occupied was another thing I started doing as well!) I'd snack on green vegetables. Pretty boring, I know, but it worked. I also made sure to eat tons of meat/fish, I was eating ~180g of protein a day and I was trying to keep my carbohydrates down, I'd only have carbs ~1-2 hours before working out and ~1-2 hours after. My cardio schedule was three days a week, I'd do 15-25 minutes on my treadmill at a reasonable speed, I just wanted to control my breathing and sweat as much as I could. LIFTING, STATS & PROGRAM I started going to the gym five times a week right off the bat. I was so motivated, was resting a lot and was eating reasonably so I wasn't getting tired. Here were my starting stats (AUG 22ND) (sets x reps x weight) SQUAT : 4 x 12 x 95 lbs BENCH : 4 x 12 x 75 lbs DEADLIFT : 4 X 12 X 75 Here are my ending stats (DECEMBER 22ND) (sets x reps x weight) SQUAT : 4 x 12 x 185 lbs BENCH : 4 x 12 x 155 lbs DEADLIFT : 4 x 12 x 225 LBS ROUTINE I didn't just stick to one routine, I've switched it up quite a few in the last 4 months but they're all pretty similar when it comes down to it. I was on a 5 day brosplit (ehehehehe :D) Day 1 (Chest/Triceps) DB Fly 4 x 12 Incline Bench Press 4 x 12 Chest Press 4 x 12 Pec-Deck 4 x 12 Push-down 4 x 12 Overhead Extension 4 x 12 Day 2 (Back/Biceps) Deadlift 4 x 12 Close-grip Pull downs 4 x 12 Seated Cable Rows 4 x 12 One Arm Dumbbell 4 x 12 Dumbbell Curls 4 x 12 Hammer Curls 4 x 12 Day 3 (Shoulders) Shoulder Press 4 x 12 Side Raises DB 4 x 12 Side Raises Machine 4 x 12 Reverse Pec-deck 4 x 12 Bent Over Lateral Raises 4 x 12 Front Raises 4 x 12 Day 4 (Legs) Squats 4 x 12 Leg Extension 4 x 12 Leg Press 4 x 12 Lunges 4 x 12 Seated Leg Curl 4 x 12 Lying Leg Curl 4 x 12 Day 5 (Arms) Barbell Curl 4 x 12 Preacher Curl Machine 4 x 12 Incline Hammer Curl 4 x 12 High Cable Curl 4 x 12 Push Downs 4 x 12 Skullcrushers 4 x 12 Dips 4 x 12 Overhead Extension 4 x 12 CONCLUSION That about concludes my post, hopefully I inspired you to make a change in your life, I sure know I made a change in mine. I've also started a fitness channel with my friend but I don't think I'm allowed to post it here due to self-promotion rules, but I posted my transformation video on /r/videos and I'm more than glad to answer any questions you have, just reply to the thread or message me /u/nefitt  HAPPY NEW YEAR!

2rkl54,"[Third-World Squat](https://www.google.com/search?q=third+world+squat&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS539US539&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=mHWsVIffI8nsoATInICQBQ&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1366&bih=643) ---- **Important Edit:** Since this is getting popular I want to add some caution. Flexibility does not come overnight. Or even over a month. It's a progression just like any workout. If you can't keep your heels on the floor, or your calves/shins hurts, or you can't stay below parallel for more than a few seconds, *work your way into it*. Start slowly. Lean on a wall as support to go deeper. Put a wooden block or rolled up towel under your heels for some help. Go at it slowly until you can hold a full squat and stay there for some amount of time. Then try to increase your stamina.  Also, my sincerest apologies for using the term Third-World. It's not meant to be offensive, so sorry if anyone took it that way. It's a layman's term and most people know it by that. If I had used something like ""full squat"" not everyone would have understood it from just the title. Just because the position is poorly named doesn't mean every connotation is bluntly offensive or racist. Sincerely, someone born in a Third-World country (Punjab).  ---- Live and breathe the Third-World Squat. Do it everyday and stay in that position for 10+ minutes. Do it until you get to the point where squatting down feels more comfortable than sitting in a chair (trust me, it gets pretty comfortable).  I see people in the gym every day with bad squat form caused by lack of flexibility. The only obstacle you want between you and your new Squat PR is that 5lbs of weight - not slightly stiff hip flexors or hamstrings.  If you don't feel comfortable squatting down without weights, then trying the same movement *with* weights isn't doing your muscles any justice.  tl;dr: Become the TWS.  **Edit 1:** [To the people with injuries](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2rkl54/want_to_get_better_at_squatting_do_thirdworld/cngy1xn?context=3) **Edit 2:** Doing TWSs helps your overall squat form because squatting is a natural movement that's supposed to take no effort. Babies squat when they're little. Old men squat around the world. People like us sit in chairs all day long causing some parts of our bodies to lose flexibility and proper range of motion. This could mean your hip flexors are tight, or your ankles, hamstrings, lower back, etc, etc. In order to keep your flexibility, just like muscles, you need to use it. Becoming more comfortable with TWSs means you're addressing your weaknesses. When you notice your initial pull during a deadlift is lacking, doing bad deadlifts isn't the most optimal way to get better at them. Sometimes you need to strech more so you can actually perform the full range of motion. In the deadlift example you might try doing deficit deadlifts, or trap-bar deadlifts.  **Edit 3:** Use your common sense... If your knees hurt don't dive right into a full ass-to-ground squat. If they keep hurting no matter what you might have some other issues with your knee. Don't substitute reddit for your doctor's advice. And don't think this thread is meaningless because a select few individuals have genuine concerns with squatting. ","I used to do this at work, but after ripping a pair of pants I started doing it in the disabled bathroom with my pants down. One day I forgot to lock the door and the admin assistant walked in on me, just third world squatting in the middle of this giant bathroom, with my pants around my ankles. It must have looked like I was trying to shit on the floor or something, was very awkward. I haven't really been doing it as much since then.",3431
2rwy05,"I'll give a brief TL;DR here, Lost lots of weight, looked decent, went into a long coma and looked like a skeleton, then put lots of weight back on over this year. Height: 6'4 193cm 2010-2013 (300lbish to 198lbs) http://i.imgur.com/8qBWXXI.jpg March 2014 to today (9 months, 141lbs to 205lbs) http://i.imgur.com/bKISszX.jpg  Basically in 2010 I was 15, extremely fat (over 300lbs), and life sucked. I made big changes over the next two to three years which were spurred mainly by rugby and weightlifting, and as you all know learning to control my diet. I lost over 100lbs and gained a bit of muscle over a 2-3 year period, but most of the progress was made in the final year, between the ages of 17-18. Here are the results from the initial weightloss. http://i.imgur.com/8qBWXXI.jpg Unfortunately near the end of 2013, after finally reclaiming my body, I fell severely ill with pneumonia. On christmas day I was rushed to hospital after a large hole formed in my right lung. I was hopped onto morphine for two days, of which I remember nothing. I was put in an induced coma, and was in intensive care for 60 days, 30ish of which were in the coma. This time last year my mother was planning my funeral. It was very touch and go due to organ failure while on life support.  When I woke from the coma I was too weak to move my legs or raise my arms. For three months I didn't eat or drink. For two months I couldn't talk (due to having a tracheostomy with breathing support). It was hell incarnate, a true experience of suffering and pain. I was incredibly angry throughout the experience. Why the fuck did this happen? Why do I have to lose everything? One resounding thing which was constantly on my mind throughout was, ""I'm going to murder the gym when I get out"".  I had to gradually start walking again, getting motor skills back etc. When I got out of hospital simple things like putting on shoes and walking to the fridge exhausted me. I bought a 2kg weight and starting doing curls, but could only manage a few reps. I went to physical rehab regularly, but I bailed out halfway through and started my gym membership again. I did a four day split focusing on compound movements, and ate at a 500kcal surplus. I packed on strength and size, and put on 40kg over the course of this year. Over the last two months I have cut 10kg in order to lean down for summer. (achieving this with a simple 500kcal deficit).  My results are not perfect. i had a lot of issues this year, I shattered my hand at the peak of my bulk due to poor bone density following the coma. I didn't take time off the gym, I just got a strap to clip my cast to the cable machine and did a modified full body workout. I do not advocate this for anyone else, but I was willing to risk it. I also had really bad knee pain from the 4~ months of bedrest, which has made it very difficult to squat and do any running or walking based cardio.  I cant compare stats from hospital, as I couldn't move my arms so I'm assuming I was a lightweight. Here are my stats now squat: 140kg 1rm deadlift: 150kg 1rm bench: 5 reps of 85 (I have never tested max) strict press: 60kg 1rm I'm not sure if I've provided enough detail, so feel free to ask questions. I also apologize in advance for any formatting issues, this is my first post.  My message to you all: Before the coma, I was extremely fit. My lungs and body were strong, I had weight to waste away. If I had still been obese with a shitty diet I would be dead. If I hadn't taken cardio so seriously i would be dead. If my body hadn't been strong, I would be dead. The doctors said it was a miracle I survived, and if it really was that close, all those factors related to fitness would definitely have pushed me over that threshold which made me survive. The gym is some serious shit man. ","That's an inspiration man, makes me question whether I've been pushing myself hard enough! Thanks for the post. Also, great choice with the socks, wouldn't want to get sunburnt!",489
2sa62s,"There have been a few posture related posts since New Years which hopefully means that people have made resolutions to correct some bad habits. I have been doing something similar lately so I thought I would offer advice from my own experients to correct posture; in my case anterior pelvic tilt, forward head and rounded shoulders. Classic caveman office worker!   &nbsp; The FAQ's here and other guides gave me a solid starting point so I have boiled down a routine that works well for me and has seen good results in a short amount of time. This is not to say it will be best for everyone and their particular physiology.   &nbsp; **These resources are invaluable:**   [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_fix_my_poor_posture.3F)   [Neanderthal no more](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_repair/neanderthal_no_more_part_i)   [Alan Thrall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEn61BL4Nwk)   &nbsp; I won't go into explanations as these are covered better by others in the above links but instead just give the exercises and some notes.  &nbsp;  **Anterior pelvic tilt**   Glute squeeze - I found this much easier for targetting my glutes than the classic glute bridge exercise and I can do it as often as I want throughout the day while on breaks at work.   Demo: http://bretcontreras.com/5-things-you-should-do-everyday/   &nbsp; Ab squeeze - If you can focus this contraction in a way that it is rotating your hips forward (think of pointing your crotch up to the sky) then you can more specifically target the muscles used to stabalise tilting. Again you can do this throughout the day.  Ab-rollers or planks can be added too but this one shouldn't be neglected.   Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDx1xfSobG4   &nbsp; Quad/Psoas stretch - I didn't think this did much at first but I do notice standing more confortably after it now. Turning it into a lunge will also help with hip mobility.   Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hQSJVIN3c   &nbsp; I have good hip mobility already which is why I have not included too much on it here. It can be an issue for people with a tilt so make sure to include hip flexor stretches if it applied to you.   &nbsp; **Forward head**   Wall stretches - This comes from neanderthall article but there are additional stretches I have found more effective in the video below (found in another post). I now do both as 1 routine.   Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTV6UCh-yhs and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ9-X5TUNjI   &nbsp; **Rounded shoulders**   Yates row - I am currently running Phraks Greyskill LP (http://imgur.com/4zQdb) and the addition of rows has helped massively in balancing my previously push dominant routine. I do this with a supinated grip. Other types of rows are available but this one seems to work for me.   Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aETWa2h1Pko   &nbsp; Scapula rotations - This came from my physio and works nicely to bring the shoulders out again. If you are lifting it is also just good sense to add some scapula work to prevent injury.   Demo w dumbbell: http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Infraspinatus/DBLyingExternalRotation.html   Demo w cable: http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Infraspinatus/CBStandingExternalRotation.html   &nbsp; Face pulls - Highlighted at T-Nation as a great exercise for posture correction. I do this after every workout using light weights/high reps. Keep it light and get the form right.   Demo: http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/you_should_be_doing_face_pulls   &nbsp; For me these represent the best bang for buck exercises that have really helped. I'm no expert by any means but I hope this is a good starting point for some people looking to change.   &nbsp; Lastly, more than anything else try to be aware of your posture throughout the day in all activities. It's fine to correct inbalances as above but if you keep up bad habbits this work is never ending.

2shm8m,"How Protein Becomes Muscle; Digestion: Enzymes in your stomach and small intestines break the protein into peptides, combinations of at least two or three amino acids (a.k.a your body's building blocks). Then other enzymes further dice the peptides into individual amino acids. Transport: The amino acids travel directly from your gastrointestinal tract to your liver via the hepatic portal vein. While the liver's main job is to detoxify the blood, it also propels amino acids back into your bloodstream for delivery to your muscles. Response: Your muscles are essentially bundles of long fibers. Strength training cause microtears in these fibers that signal your immune system to send out a work crew (growth hormone and stem cells) and repair material (amino acids) to the damaged areas. Construction: Your DNA acts as a construction foreman: It calls up specific amino acids, directs their deployment, and assigns their roles. The muscle fiber work crew uses the fresh supply of amino acids to weave myofibrils; these are bundles of the protein filaments myosin and actin, which are critical to muscle contraction. Repair And Growth: The newly made myofibrils fuse with the damaged areas of your muscle fibers. But microtear repair is more than just a patch job: These myofibrils also help make the muscle bigger and stronger than it was before. Time to flex.",Thanks brah.

2u2k6q,I just stumbled over this newspaper article and thought this might be interesting to see here. In Switzerland there is a group that tries to start an initiative politically to make it possible for doctors to prescribe fitness training to people. This would mean that health care would cover all your gym expenses if this goes through. What are your opinions on this?  https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzz.ch%2Fschweiz%2Ffitness-studios-wollen-sich-von-kassen-bezahlen-lassen-1.18469197,"Since so many diseases are just a symptom of a lack of exercise, I don't see why it's not his way already.",2258
2u6hoi,"TREAT THE GYM LIKE A SPA.  Yes. It has to feel good. I tell people this a lot - go to the gym, and just sit there, and read a magazine, and then go home. And do this every day. Go to the gym, don't even work out. Just GO. Because the habit of going to the gym is more important than the work out. Because it doesn't matter what you do. You can have fun - but as long as you're having fun, you continue to do it. But what happens is you get a trainer, your whole body is sore, you can't feel your legs, and you're not coming back the next day - you might not come back for a year!  I worked my way up to 2 hours a day. I ENJOY my workouts. They are my peace, my joy - I get my whole head together! I value that time more than my shower! And it really gets me together. But it's a habit. There are times when - I'm not even kidding - there are times when I""m in the middle of a work out, and actually woke up because i am so engrained with going to the gym and being there - it's that much of a habit to me. The first thing I do in the morning is work out - I lay out my workout clothes the night before, and just hop in 'em.  So lay out your clothes, and go to the gym, and relax. HaAHAHAH! But sooner or later, you WILL work out. ",Terry Crews is the most real celebrity I know.,2982

2uz29s,Article here: http://www.thejournal.ie/calories-menus-1921415-Feb2015/ A welcome change in my view. I always have a problem with eating out as It is hard to estimate the calories that you are consuming.  I can see how this would be a problem for non-fastfood places where menus change and portions are at the discretion of the chef.,Very unfair for small restaurants. I've got friends and families who run restaurants with menus that are essentially from scratch on a daily basis depending on what food is in season/in the market etc. Giving them this extra overhead when they are already been hit with many other costs is another tough break.,182

Even though we're in a hyper-connected digital age where everything is either available at our fingertips online through the mail or at a quick jaunt to the local store. we're for the most part more alone than ever. When you couple that with a complete lack of nutrition in the foods we're sold as healthy and the food pyramid foisted upon us by our well intentioned but knee-jerk Government Food Nannies. well, we end up with a whole lot of little pods floating around lost nutritionally like I was.. feeling lost and alone. Not sure what to do and how to start the journey back to health. A brief Timeline: This is me when I started the Journey (Edited to add another picture that my Daughter contributed from Mother's Day 2014. what a sad photo.) [Mother's Day 2014](http://i.imgur.com/wjeDwoG.jpg) [412 Lbs in April of 2014 - 132 lbs lost in 9 months](http://i.imgur.com/UILdD1g.jpg) *April 12th 2014 - I had Strep Throat and went to the Dr. for a prescription. Their scale read 412 lbs and I was devastated. as long as I avoided actually confronting the numbers on the scale. I could ignore how heavy I was. sort of, I was sick all the time, and getting dizzy, and generally feeling horrible.  I decided to cut out Soda with sugar.  *Mothers Day May 11th 2014 - My sister is a Type 2 diabetic and I asked her to check my blood sugar readings after dinner. Hers was 118 and mine was 289. That's not good. In fact, that's the type of number which indicates organ damage if left untreated. *May 12th 2014 - The day after Mothers Day I asked my Doctor to run a Fasting Glucose test and it came back at 279 which is really bad. His reaction was, ""You Win!.. I told you to cut sugar and lose weight.. you didn't.. so you win the prize. Type 2 Diabetes.."" I love my Doctor, he's a smartass like me. (no, really I do.. good guy.) They put me on the big 3. Metformin, Lisinopril & Simvastatin. Now I'm an adult right? I'm on 3 lifetime medicines for a disease! YAY! not  * But, cutting out the sugar in my soda.. I had lost 15 lbs. Hmmmm. so, cutting sugar helps me lose weight. without doing anything else. I've already jacked up my pancreas and won't be using Insulin to get rid of sugar the normal way. so lets just avoid sugar all together.* *August 2014 - They run this test to check your ""average Blood Sugar levels"" called the A1C which tells them how much sugar was left floating around inside your bloodstream after the insulin did its job. I had quit eating all forms of simple starches.. NO Sugar, NO Bread or Tortillas, NO Pasta, NO Rice, NO Potatoes, NO Simple Starches at all..  TONS of veggies. Broccoli, Cauliflower, Green Beans, Carrots (yes they have a little sugar but they're good for you, hush) Veggies, Veggies, Veggies, and Meat, Lean and not Lean, meat, Meat, MEAT.. I did make a conscious choice to avoid eating bacon and fatty meats often.. I wasn't shooting for a Atkins high level Ketosis state. I was shooting for a state where my body didn't have easy to store Carbs.. I didn't count calories and just ate when hungry.. I portioned out meat.. 8 oz of chicken or beef cubes. frozen in small tupperware containers. and added them to veggies with Sriracha and Soy Sauce. and whatever else caught my fancy. usually Parmesan cheese or a little cheddar. And I walked on a treadmill at the gym. 5x a week for 45 min each time..  and the weight fell off..  I'd lost 60 lbs and was down to 337 and my A1C of 5.3 indicated my average BS was 118 over the past 3 months now. that's still a tad high for a normal person if you use conservative measures of Blood Sugar. and I'm eating no carbs at all but it's safe...  * November 2014 -  They checked my A1C again and it's still at 118 BS (5.3-5.4 A1C range) and I'm down to 297 Lbs (another 40 lbs lost). They're taking me off all of my meds and the issues I have with my back are going away now that my weight is down. I can finally walk with less pain and my limp from the Stenosis in my back is going away. I join a Gym. *Feb 2015 - I've been at 280 lbs for the past 2 months. but I've lost inches of fat off my chest and lost multiple inches off my waist and belly. I've been lifting as heavy as possible to build muscle. I would like ideally to make this last part of the conversion a plateau before a fast drop. but the plateau will be a fat burning and muscle building plateau. :) It's a long process.. I'm 44 and not 24.. so the skin doesn't have elasticity it once did.. after I get down to a good weight, I'll have surgery to remove some skin.. which is not... not.. not... pretty..  So I won't be sharing any body pictures in my undies.. sorry Ladies (and Gents who're into that type of thing. ;) )  but I do have a picture from a few days ago.. freshly shaved head.. and full body picture from about a month ago.. although I have lost some belly, you couldn't tell by how I was dressed anyhow. :)  [Weight Loss Journey 75% done](http://i.imgur.com/l2x7x7g.jpg) [280 lbs in Feb of 2015 - 132 lbs lost in 9 months](http://i.imgur.com/GhOhWL4.jpg) I decided to add something in here at the end: When you're working on your own fitness or weight loss plan:  #1 Forgive yourself when you mess up. #2 Figure out what triggered the slip. #3 Fix the problem that caused the slip. #4 Forge ahead.

2w35bc,"**My Story** I've always struggled with my weight. Ever since middle school I was self-conscious about being overweight. It seemed like I tried everything but eating right and exercising. I was one of those people who just wanted a quick solution. I would even starve myself but ended up so hungry that I would go on an all out binge. In 2006, I bought The Biggest Loser book. This was the first time something actually clicked with me. I did the diet and all exercises for 3 months straight. The plan consisted of a ton cardio and light resistance training. The diet used a formula (CW x 7 = Calories in a day), meaning at one point I was only eating 1260 calories a day. I went from 260 to 180. Looking back, that was pretty drastic but I was only 23 and my body responded very quickly to the program. I was skinny for the first time in my life with no muscle. At the end of the program I didn't know what to do and reverted back to my old habits. Over 8 years, I gained 50 pounds. I was in complete denial. My thought process was, ""Well, as long as I'm not as big as that (morbidly obese) guy, I'll be fine."" My excuses included, ""I don't have enough time to work out,"" or ""I'm too poor to buy healthy food."" I saw an ad for P90X3 which is a shorter version of P90X. I tried doing P90X before and was somewhat successful. I enjoyed the workouts but they were to long at an hour and a half. So this 30 minute version I could go for. I ordered it and did the first two weeks and stopped. I don't have a reason or an excuse for stopping, I just did. For 3 months.  **May 2014** M/30/5'11 Starting weight: 230 In May, I decided to give it another go...not to lose weight just to tone what little muscle I had. That was the plan until I took my before pictures. http://imgur.com/a/kiCx5 These pictures absolutely devastated me. I couldn't be in denial any more I was ready to change. I cleared out my garage, hooked up a TV and bought a pull-up bar and a dumbbell set. I started the P90X3 classic routine thinking I would ultimately fail but this time was different. I kept going. 6 days a week. one month down. two months down. I was thinking I could actually do this! My mind was set to finish! Diet for my first round was a little restrictive. I followed The Biggest Loser formula to figure my daily caloric intake. The only thing I tracked was calories not protein, carbs or fat. Very little processed food, high protein/low carb. Typical meals included: *Breakfast-* 1/2 cup of oatmeal or Bran flakes, Banana *Lunch-* 4 oz. chicken Breast, 1 Cup Broccoli, 1/2 cup of cottage Cheese or String Cheese, Apple *Dinner-* 3 oz 90/10 Ground beef, Spiraled Squash, Spaghetti Sauce *Snack-* Lots of Watermelon I finished the first round of P90X at 190. I decided to keep up the program and finished my second round at 159. There was a point at the beginning of my third round where The Biggest Loser formula was no longer working. I was eating about 1200 calories a day while doing these extreme workouts. I was tired and experiencing dizzy spells. I knew I needed to eat more calories but I was so afraid of gaining weight that I couldn't bring myself to do it. I joined /r/fitness and read a lot of posts on nutrition. I get excited about Nutrition Tuesdays. Here, people were eating anywhere from 2400 to 3500 calories a day and also tracking macros, which I've never heard of. So I figured, what the hell, I guess I could afford to gain weight. In my last round I upped my calories each phase and started watching my macros. I am currently eating 2400 calories and eating about 180g of protein a day. I plan on increasing this even more when I start my next workout regiment. Meals for this round included: *Breakfast-* 1/2 cup of oatmeal, 2 eggs, glass of milk or latte *Lunch-* 6 oz. chicken Breast, Salad, 1/2 cup of cottage Cheese or String Cheese, Apple *Dinner-* Chicken Tortilla Soup, Fajitas, 90/10 stuffed mushroom and swiss burgers. *Snack-* Whey Protein, Peanut Butter Sandwich, greek yogurt **February 2015** I just finished my 3rd round of P90X3 and I have no plans on quitting now. M/31/5'11 Current Weight: 166.8 http://imgur.com/a/4lQ64 **Things that have helped me succeed** * I had to find a workout plan that fit my schedule starting out but I think that will change the fitter I get. I'll have to adapt my schedule to my workout routine. * Doing my workouts at home I had to find a private, dedicated space. I park the car in the street now and use my garage * Learn to cook. Eating the same thing everyday sucks, subs like /r/eatcheapandhealthy, /r/fitmeals and /r/cooking are the reason I can resist the urge to order a pizza. * Track your progress! I am a visual person so seeing my weight loss and progress helped me to keep pushing forward. Here's how I tracked it http://i.imgur.com/8zpHgHf.jpg * Drink tons of water. I found a large container I enjoy drinking out of and fill it 3-4 times a day. **Looking ahead** My immediate plans are to keep moving forward with P90X3, but I want to eventually build up my home gym to include more equipment so I can push myself even further. **tl;dr** It's all about diet and exercise EDIT: Thanks everybody for the compliments!

I'm back for another installment of my journey from fat to fit as requested by many of you. This is my third installment of my journey. Here is the original post from last year: **[Clinically obese(class II) to ripped](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/21yvse/my_3_year_transformation_from_clinically_obese/)** - My goal for this is to offer a simple blueprint that anyone can use. When I first began this journey i had no idea where to start. I'm going to highlight all my strategies that have worked in the hopes of helping someone who is in a similar predicament.  --------------------- **Stats** --------------------- --------------------- Sex: Male Age: 27 Height: 5’10” Before: **[240lb](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg)** After: **[160lb](http://imgur.com/5qPbxJR)** **[Face gains](http://imgur.com/teT7BJ6)** --------------------- **Recap and update** --------------------- ---------------------   * Back in 2011 I was an **[obese, depressed, alcoholic, smoker.](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg)** * After becoming fed up with my sloppyness and lack of dates, I started dieting and **[running on a treadmill.](http://i.imgur.com/NJWhPjM.jpg)** * I lost 80lbs, quit smoking and drinking and got **[really skinny.](http://i.imgur.com/CQtMdX7.png)** * Having lost so much weight, I had accumulated some **[loose skin.](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png)** * Luckily, I am privileged enough to afford the surgery to remove said skin so I took the dive and **[got the surgery.](http://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg)** * After the skin had gone I finally felt I could achieve a beach body and decided to enter a physique competition, more as a challenge to myself than anything else. **[Here I am on stage in October at the Iron Man Natural.](http://i.imgur.com/5qPbxJR.jpg)** * **[Here is the full album from the event.](http://imgur.com/a/clV63)** * Since the competition I have transitioned into my first **intentional** bulk ever. The mental aspect of this is incredibly difficult. Keep in mind I have been dieting consistently for almost 4 years. To reverse that mentality and actually welcome weight gain has proven to be a challenge.  * The beginning of the bulk was awesome. I was still lean from my competition but started filling out from the increased calories. **[This gym selfie](http://i.imgur.com/qtrJ7YZ.jpg)** I took got featured on a fitness motivation **[Instagram account.](http://instagram.com/p/vZeZnUjecV)** * At the beginning of this year my local gym asked me if I would model for them as they needed pics for a new gym website. I wasn't expecting this opportunity and was not as lean as I would have liked. I agreed to the photo shoot and tried my best to dehydrate and carb load. * **[Here is the full album.](http://imgur.com/a/hRjtL)**  --------------------- **Diet** --------------------- --------------------- * I've tried almost every diet and had some success with a few of them but the philosophy I choose to follow today is that of IIFYM or counting macros. * Counting macros is not a diet per se but more a way of eating that makes you aware of what you are ingesting. To count macros you use a calorie counter to track all the foods you eat and then look at the macro nutrient breakdowns of those foods and eat in an intentional way that will hit your goal number of carbs, fats and proteins. In this way you can still subscribe to a more food specific diet but doing so with this strategy makes you conscious of your macros. * For my show prep I did a classic bodybuilder prep diet consisting of tilapia, brown rice and broccoli. Although I was not IIFYM dieting, I did calculate the macros to be **45 fat, 145 carb and 225 protein(1,885 calories)**. I got incredibly lean doing this but it was unnecessarily difficult. * After the competition I began increasing my calories slowly by about 15 carbs and 3 fats a week. This is called a reverse diet and it's purpose is to allow your body to adjust to increased calories without putting on excess fat. My current lean bulking macros are **60 fat, 400 carb and 200 protein(2,940 calories)**. I've gained a total of 20lbs since beginning this increase. **[Start](http://i.imgur.com/bryeDrv.jpg)** and **[now](http://i.imgur.com/PBVRnCD.jpg)** * **Supplements:** creatine, fish oil, multivitamin. I have never used steroids or pro-hormones.  --------------------- **Training** --------------------- --------------------- * Towards the end of my show prep, when I was reaching low single digit body fat percentages, my strength took a steep dive. Since my show, I have been focusing much of my time in the gym on strength. * I do Jim Wendler's Boring But Big 5/3/1 strength protocol. Here is a link to **[the program](http://www.jimwendler.com/2013/05/boring-but-big/)** and the **[5/3/1 calculator](http://blackironbeast.com/5/3/1/calculator)**. This program is for intermediate lifters. My favorite beginner program is ICF 5x5. **[Here is a graphic with the specific exercises](http://i.imgur.com/RmTpFHC.jpg)**.   **Current one rep maxes:** OHP: 145lb Squat: 315lb Bench: 240lb DL: 405lb  --------------------- **Motivation** --------------------- --------------------- * **""How do you stay motivated?""** This is the most frequent question I've received from my reddit posts and it’s difficult to answer. * Originally my motivation was to look better and not be ignored by girls. This kept me going for a while but if that were my only motivation I would have fallen off a long time ago. Today my motivation is intrinsic, it comes from within. Lifting weights is part of who I am. It’s not something I try to get out of the way any more. I cherish my time in the gym. * In the early days, to get through times of low motivation, I made the gym part of my routine. If I didn't think about it, I wouldn't think my way out of it. After work everyday I went to the gym on my way home. Instead of being home from work at 4:30, I was home at 5:30 because I went to the gym first. Making myself go was the hardest part. --------------------- **Things I wish I had known** --------------------- --------------------- * **Cardio<Weights<Diet** - This is the order of importance if an aesthetically appealing physique is the goal. Diet is the most important part of gaining or losing weight. To gain or lose weight in order to achieve an aesthetic figure, weight training is paramount. Cardio is a tool to use in conjunction with diet and weights to help achieve a caloric deficit. * **Tracking** - If your goal is to achieve an aesthetic physique, tracking is a must. Tracking your diet, body weight and the weights you lift gives you the ability to view progress and analyze the variables. Being able to manipulate these variables is essential to break through plateaus. MyFitnessPal is great for tracking. ----------- - A couple years ago I was sitting on my computer reading posts like this one, wondering if it was possible for me to do the same thing. It ***was*** possible for me and it ***is*** possible for you too. I am not naturally a fit person. The success I have found has come from consistent positive choices. - If you are thinking about starting your own fitness journey, **DO IT**. You'll be glad you did. The way I feel is great, the way I look is awesome but the biggest difference is the way I'm treated today. I feel a sense of respect from complete strangers and people seem to **WANT** to talk to me. I'm still getting used to it, but it's awesome. - I'll answer any questions you may have. I'm an open book. I have no secrets.  - **TL;DR [Before](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg) and [after](http://imgur.com/5qPbxJR)** ",wtf those face gains. you went from jonah hill to channing tatum. you are 21 jump street,3084
2wkscn,"I've been wanting to share my progress for a while now, and I finally feel like I'm at a spot where it's worth it.  I carried probably 80% of my extra fat on my stomach, 10% on my upper arms, and the remaining 10% throughout the rest of my body.  I really hate my old photos but it's nice to have them for comparison! [Summarized progress, the first photos I took and the most recent photos side by side.](http://i.imgur.com/nDwipkv.jpg)  [Detailed progress, with dates and weights.](http://i.imgur.com/Qea01ZG.png)   Since I only started lifting halfway into my diet, it's interesting to see how lifting started changing my body! **CURRENT MEASUREMENTS:** Waist, 27"" - Hips, 34"" **CURRENT LIFTS:** Squat, 105 lbs - Bench, 95 lbs - OHP, 55 lbs - One armed rows, 30 lbs - Deadlifts ended at 135 lbs ___________ A year ago, just after Valentine's day, I decided to get into shape.  This was with a caring, gentle, loving nudge from my boyfriend (it's not an easy conversation so props and *thank you* to him).  I had been feeling gross and insecure about my body for a few months at that point but was in denial, so hearing it from him was the push I needed to get my head out from under the sand!  I'd like to add I was about 135 lbs when we started dating in 2010, so this was a slow increase in weight. I started my lifestyle change right away.  My biggest problem was that my portions were too big, my TDEE is about 1800 cals and I was eating the same portions as my boyfriend who's TDEE is ~2700.   I cut my calories to 1200 but ate pretty much whatever I wanted as long as I budgeted for it, and it worked.  I guess I was technically doing IF with a 16/8 cycle but that was just coincidental since I've never been a big breakfast eater anyways.  I was also doing Couch to 5k at the same time but had to stop after a few weeks because of an old ankle problem that came up again.  So I just dieted for a couple of months.  I'd also like to note that I avoided the scale and taking photos like the plague for the first month... it felt like too much pressure.  But I know from a prior Dr's appointment that I was sitting around 157 lbs the beginning of 2014.   Once I was close to dipping below 130, I started going to the gym and doing SS 5x5, 3 days a week.  Because of this, I increased my calories to 1,500 a day.  I still ate whatever I wanted, and would drink protein after workouts.  I did not count the protein towards my calories.   The lifts really changed the way my body looked.  I never had much of a separation between my lower back and my butt but it's emerging now!  And I went from thinking I looked good at 126 in August to comparing that to me at 126 now and thinking I looked kind of fat!  It's pretty crazy.   I know my squat seems pretty low, but that's because I've been dealing with IT band pain that required me to drop weight and increase really slowly.  Back in November I was squatting 135 lbs.  I've stepped away from deadlifts while I get my squat back up because the issue in my legs is probably acute compartment syndrome and I can reduce the inflammation by not using my legs too much (and I like squats more than DL).   After the new year I dropped my calories back down to 1300.  I've got 2-3 lbs of fat that I'd like to lose.  1300 isn't a hard limit for me either... I try to stick to it most of the time but if I want/need to I'll eat more as long as I don't pass 1800!  It's been two months of the 1300 calories and I'm definitely seeing some fat loss between the January pics and the photos I took today!   ____ **MY ADVICE FOR OTHERS:**   **Be committed and give yourself rewards for hitting milestones.**  By giving yourself a reason other than ""I want to look good"", you'll be less likely to slip.  I waited until I'd lost the 1st 10 lbs to get a haircut I really wanted.  I got to buy myself new dresses after my old ones were too big.  Then I decided I wanted to do a really good Mystique cosplay and could absolutely not be out of shape for it, and that gave me another goal to work towards!  [Bonus photo of the result, this was August 30th, 126lbs.  I tried to drop water weight for 5 days prior.](http://i.imgur.com/zDS2Vzz.jpg) **Tell as few people as possible about your goals.**  I only told my boyfriend, my best friend, and my mom in the beginning.  It wasn't until I was *very* close to my end goal that I told anyone else.  This was because I wanted to avoid comments like ""What, you look fine you don't need to diet!"" or ""Oh come on, you can have *one*.""  And when my friends asked my why I wasn't drinking anything at parties, I'd just say I was taking medication that didn't let me drink, which brings me to...  **Cut out alcohol.**  Seriously.  I didn't drink from February 2014 to September 2014.  I did the math for my deficit and it just wasn't worth it.  On some days when I had 150 cals left after dinner I might have had a beer or a glass of wine, but I almost always opted for a candy bar instead. Mmmm chocolate!  The bonus now is that my tolerance is pretty low haha.   **Don't subtract calories from exercise** (unless you do something that burns shittons of calories).  First of all, the calories estimates for exercise in MFP are *wayyyyy* off.  They are way too generous.  I've seen it tell people that walking 2 miles burned 450 calories.  People complain that they diet and exercise but don't lose weight... well if you are counting exercise towards your diet and use MFP for that, I'm not surprised!  Second of all, I'm of the opinion that if you're trying to lose weight, why run 3 miles and then eat those extra 300 calories?  You could be losing weight by keeping that deficit.  As long as you're eating at least the minimum your body needs, you don't *have* to replenished those calories burned through exercise.   However, I'd like to reiterate that if you do some exercise that burns tons of calories (like intense swimming), you should probably eat those back!  But if you're doing those exercises you're probably in excellent shape and not trying to lose weight either :p   _______________ Thanks so much for reading!

2x4iwj,"Hey guys, I'm back. You can find my first 101 post right here: [Biceps 101: An Anatomical Guide to Training](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2wcaoi/biceps_101_an_anatomical_guide_to_training/) >The average person's triceps routine is stationed at the press down station. But the triceps are a unique muscle group that needs to be trained in various ways to maximize growth. >**ANATOMY**   >There are three heads to the triceps muscle; the [long. lateral, and medial head]( http://www.seannal.com/images/tricep-heads.jpg).  >* The long head starts (originates) on the scapula (shoulder blade) >* The lateral and medial heads both start on the [humerus](http://thumb101.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/1569284/190913903/stock-photo--d-rendered-illustration-of-the-female-humerus-bone-back-view-190913903.jpg) (bone of the upper arm) >All three heads then come together to a single tendon and attach (insert) on to the [ulna](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Ulna_-_anterior_view.png).  >A really interesting fact about the triceps is that different muscle fiber types make up different heads of the muscle.   >* Medial Head        >* Primarily made up of small type I fibers (“slow twitch” muscle fibers, which are used in lower intensity exercises. These fibers are involved in muscular endurance/high rep training) >* Lateral head         >* Predominantly made up of large type IIb fiber types (“fast twitch” muscle fibers, which are used during high intensity exercise.  This fiber type is involved in high force, power, and speed generation.) >* Long head         * Made up of a mixture of both fiber types >**FUNCTION** >The function of every muscle depends on its origins and insertions. If a muscle crosses a joint, it will act on that joint. For example, since the triceps go across the elbow and attach on the forearm, flexing the triceps will affect the elbow joint.  More specifically, the triceps will [extend the elbow]( http://www.fitnessreal.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/flexion-and-extension-14398F2FAC42C0BD480.gif). This is their primary action.  >But remember that the long head of the triceps starts at the shoulder blade. This means that the triceps must also affect movement at the shoulder joint.  The long head of the triceps plays a role in:  >* [adducting your arm](http://machinedesign.com/site-files/machinedesign.com/files/uploads/2014/07/What%E2%80%99s-the-diff-Abd-AddWEB.jpg)  >* [shoulder extension](https://breddydotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/shoulder-flexion-and-extension.png).   >**TRAINING TIPS** >Due to the diversity in muscle fibers that make up the triceps, it is very important to train them in low, medium, and high rep ranges to attain maximal growth (the medial head is used primarily for light/high rep exercises, the lateral head for heavy/low rep exercise, and the long head is used for all exercises). >**LOW REP TRAINING** >It is recommended to use compound movements to target your triceps. This is because using heavy weights for isolation exercises (such as skull crushers) can be very detrimental to your elbow health.  Use compound movements for your heavier triceps training. The best compound movements, in my opinion, for triceps growth are: >* [Close grip bench press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ruy94BZ6FmE)  >* [Weighted dips](http://youtu.be/72gpRKE_CZI?t=1m55s)  >The grip that I use for close grip bench press is slightly less than shoulder width. The closer your grip, the more activation you will get in your triceps (to an extent). In the video linked with “close grip bench press”, Jim Stoppani cites a study where going closer than shoulder width doesn’t stimulate any further triceps activation. It is also important to remember that positioning your hands too close can place a great deal of stress on your wrists.   >Weighted dips are also a great exercise to attain triceps mass. When doing these, try to stay as upright as possible.  The more your torso leans over, the more your chest will activate.  >**HIGH REP TRAINING** >For your higher rep training, it is best to use isolation exercises. My favourites are: >* [Cable pushdowns](http://youtu.be/QPGwI4d-eHY?t=13s)  >* [Skull crushers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKbDU850mbE)  >* [Overhead dumbbell extensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbX7Wd8jQ-Q)  >Overhead tricep movements are said to primarily target the long head, while pushdown movements target the lateral head.  >Skull crushers are a great triceps exercise.  A trick that can be used to maximize triceps activation during this exercise is to allow your elbows to go back (shoulder flexion) at the bottom of the movement, and then as you push the weight up with your triceps, bring your elbows back to the normal position (extend the shoulder joint). Mark Rippetoe demonstrates this very well in [this video](http://youtu.be/-rh3MHnRI_I?t=10m52s).  >**CABLE VS BAR PUSHDOWNS** >The reason why I prefer cable pushdowns over bar pushdowns goes back to the function of the triceps.  Remember that the triceps also play a role in shoulder extension.  Shoulder extension occurs when your upper arm (humerus) is behind your body (this can be seen under the clickable link for shoulder extension under “function”).  When you are using a bar, your legs limit your range of motion. When you use a cable, you can fully contract each triceps by not only extending your elbow, but by also slightly extending your shoulder.  >[This great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPGwI4d-eHY) by IFBB Pro Ben Pakulski demonstrates how to perform triceps pushdowns correctly. >**SUMMARY**  >For a full triceps workout, I would recommend doing one compound movement, one isolation movement, and one overhead isolation movement.  Remember to train your triceps in all rep ranges, through different elbow positions (overhead, pushdown, etc) to attain maximal growth in each head.  **TL;DR** * Triceps extend the shoulder and extend the elbow * There are three heads to the triceps, each of which are composed of different muscle fibers that are active during different work loads * Overhead movements target the long head, pushdowns target the lateral head * Train the triceps in high, medium, and low rep ranges to attain maximal growth ","Thanks for that, really interesting. I've got to the point with dips where I need to move on to weighted dips. Is there any way of doing this at the gym without buying a belt?",192

When all heads of the deltoid contract at the same time, this muscle serves to [abduct the arm](http://www.nolanlee.com/uploads/3/0/9/6/30966409/4256350.jpg?365).  Another lesser known function of the deltoids as a whole is to prevent the dislocation of the humerus (upper arm) when someone lifts heavy loads. Have you ever performed heavy shrugs, deadlifts, or [farmer’s walks](http://crossfitzone.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/farmers-carry-strongman.jpg), and noticed that your delts look huge while you’re doing them? It’s because they’re working hard to make sure that the weight you’re lifting doesn’t rip your arm out of your socket. But each head of the deltoid also serves an individual purpose. >*Anterior Deltoid* >* Primarily used to abduct the shoulder when the arm is [externally rotated](http://teleanatomy.com/General%20Anatomy/Introduction%20to%20Anatomy%203rd%20Edition/Term%20movement_files/image030.jpg), [flexes the arm at the shoulder](http://www.orthopedicsatoz.org/OrthopedicsAtoZ/media/OrthopedicsAtoZ/Images/Exercises/Shoulder_07.jpg), and [internally rotates the arm](http://o.quizlet.com/HWvxEOwhMe7lo41.otLytg_m.png) >*Lateral Deltoid* >* Primarily used to abduct shoulder when the arm is internally rotated >*Posterior Deltoid* >* Primarily used to the [extend the arm at the shoulder](http://www.mskcc.org/sites/www.mskcc.org/files/node/%5Bnid%5D/images/armexercise8.png)  >**TRAINING TIPS** >Due to their numerous functions, deltoids are involved in almost every upper body workout, and many lower body workouts as well (ex. deadlift). Since they are used so often, they are very easy to injure.  It is very important to make sure you warm up and get blood flowing in your deltoids before you begin your workout so you can prevent injuries.  [Bryce Lewis demonstrates a great upper body warm up here](http://youtu.be/eGsMoJW-RDY?t=1m) (I usually do the warm up from 1:00 – 2:33). >To maximize deltoid development, it is important to train each individual head optimally.  A typical deltoid workout for myself includes one exercise for each part of the muscle.  >**ANTERIOR DELTOID TRAINING** >This head of the deltoid is used very often in pressing movements. This includes bench press, and other chest movements that move in a similar plane.  Due to this, many people, myself included, do not think that isolation work (front raises) for the anterior deltoid is necessary for the average gym goer (if you are a bodybuilder, I wouldn’t neglect isolation work for any muscle).  These are my favourite exercises for the anterior deltoid: >* [Standing military press](http://youtu.be/lwOYmash-xA?t=16s)  >* [Overhead Dumbbell Press](http://youtu.be/C-TjVJoI7D0?t=1m14s)  >* [Arnold Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odhXwoS3mDA)  >Standing military press is a great way to develop both deltoid mass and strength. One of the biggest benefits of the military press, in my opinion, is its carry over to bench press strength. Whenever my military press weight increases, so does my bench press. The same can't be said for my dumbbell press.   I like training my pressing movements in both high and low rep ranges.  I often start with heavier weights and stick around 6-8 reps, and then move to 8-12 reps towards the end of my pressing. >**LATERAL DELTOID TRAINING** >When training the deltoids through isolation work, most of my time is spent on the lateral head.  Training this part of the deltoid is what will give them that round look from the front, and will make them [“pop”](https://www.t-nation.com/system/publishing/articles/459/original/Big_Scary_Delts.jpg?1391031094). This head is not worked during pressing movements to the extent that the anterior head is, so it's important to use isolation exercise to target it.  >* [Lateral dumbbell raises](http://youtu.be/8g30LfuYJDo?t=3m53s)  >* [Behind the back lateral cable raises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihG4lDlTJ-g)  >Although lateral dumbbell raises are a very common exercise, I often see people performing them incorrectly. Remember that the function of the lateral deltoid is to raise the arm, when it is internally rotated. Many people forget this, and perform raises with an externally rotated arm. [This video by Ian McCarthy](http://youtu.be/yS2AAd_E0R0?t=1m23s) is a great demonstration on how to perform them correctly. The same rule with internal rotation also applies to cable raises.  >For raises, it is very important to use light weight and perform these in a higher rep range (10+). >**POSTERIOR DELTOID TRAINING** >This is often the most neglected part of deltoid training.  Many people believe that back training alone will target this muscle efficiently, but in order to fully develop the deltoid, and make sure that they are visible when people look at you from behind, you must work this head with isolation exercises. Neglecting posterior deltoid work can be detrimental to your shoulder health as well. Most people engage in so much pressing work, and often underwork pulling movements, leading to muscular imbalances.  >* [Rear Delt Flys](http://youtu.be/o5OvdIVV61M?t=33s)  >* [Face Pulls](http://youtu.be/HSoHeSjvIdY?t=35s)  >I prefer doing rear delt flys on the machine because I can control the movement throughout the entire range of motion, and can really feel a contraction in them.  Face pulls are an extremely beneficial exercise for your rear deltoids and overall shoulder health. **TL:DR** * Deltoids have three heads: posterior, anterior, lateral * Overall function is to abduct the arm, but each head has a specific function * Anterior deltoid abducts the shoulder when the arm is externally rotated * Lateral deltoid abducts shoulder when the arm is internally rotated * Posterior deltoid extends the shoulder * Always warm up thoroughly  * Isolation isn't necessary for anterior head unless you are a bodybuilder * Use presses for anterior head, and isolation exercises for lateral and posterior head  ",Solid stuff again.  Rear delt is definitely one of the more neglected muscles.  I'm a fan of external rotation with the cable station to help with that.  Nice video on lateral raises as well.,127

But I’ve never seen a guy with a big back that wasn’t strong.” >This is one of my favorite quotes. A big, muscular back does not come without strength.  I personally believe that to fully develop a big back, it is important to deadlift, squat, and even perform some of the Olympic lifts (cleans, snatches).  Although the lifts stated above place a large emphasis on the lower body, the back plays a fundamental role while performing them.  You’ll have a tough time finding a successful [powerlifter](http://www.getbig.com/boards/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=446436.0;attach=490747;image) or [weightlifter](http://www.allthingsgym.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lu-Xiaojun-Chinese-Weightlifting-Snatch-Pulls-Back-Cover-Milo-194-.jpg) that doesn’t have a large back.  >But putting those lifts aside, back specific work is very important. A trick I use for almost all rowing movements is using a [thumbless grip](http://fitworldexposed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7.png). A lot of people, myself included, have the tendency to pull more so with their arms rather than their back.  Using a thumbless grip lets me envision my arms as hooks for my back, allowing me to really focus on contracting my back muscles rather than using my biceps to pull. Keep in mind that using a thumbless grip also requires higher grip strength in order to hold on to the bar.  >Some people are taught that exercises using a wider grip will make your back wider, while a closer grip will make your back thicker.  Although I am not aware of any scientific studies proving this, I believe it to be true. This is through anecdotal evidence I have witnessed in my own body, and many professional bodybuilders also vouch for this.  >A back day for me consists of 4-5 lat movements, and 1-2 upper back movements (I train traps on my shoulder day). >**TRAPS TRAINING** >For the average person, their trap routine goes no further than holding [very heavy weight and barely shrugging it, moving their shoulder about a centimeter up and down](http://youtu.be/y5qKFty8Jcc?t=2m26s). Although this can be fairly effective, there are ways to train this muscle that are much safer, and are much more efficient.  >* [Deadlifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3FoLv-J854)  >* [Dumbbell Shrugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDt6qbKgLkY)  >One of the most underrated exercises for developing the traps is deadlifts. One of the functions of the traps mentioned above is to keep the humerus attached to the shoulder.  When you perform a deadlift, the traps are working like crazy to ensure that the weight you are holding on your hands doesn’t rip your arm out of its socket. Big deadlift numbers are often associated with big traps. Powerlifter [Pete Rubish](http://crossfitbattlefield.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Pete-Rubish-traps.jpg), who is well known for his monstrous deadlifts, is also well known for his cobra like traps  >Going back to shrugs, it is important to recall the functions of all fibres of the traps. Remember that they not only elevate the shoulder, but they also retract the scapula. When doing shrugs, it is important to keep your shoulder blades retracted the entire time. Neglecting this will not only hinder your trap development, but it will also have a negative impact on your posture over time. [Here](http://youtu.be/cJRVVxmytaM?t=37s) is a good video explaining how to keep perform shrugs correctly. I have personally found Medows Shrugs to the best shrug variation to develop my traps.  [Paul Carter explains them here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQuDPFplpmk).   >A very common mistake when doing shrugs is [rolling your shoulders](http://youtu.be/h3rj2KAmyHc?t=57s) as you do them.  This is not safe for your shoulders can result in injury very quickly.  >**LATS TRAINING** >The lats are one of the most important muscles in the body for healthy movement and athletic function. In almost any professional sport that involves a need for power or physical contact, you’ll see big lats. This is visible even in smaller fighters, like [Manny Pacquiao](http://www.nowboxing.com/wp-content/uploads/Pacquiao-wings-262x300.jpg).  >90% of my back training revolves around my lats. When training them, it is important to perform both overhead movements, as well as rows in the horizontal plane.  >* [Bent-Over Barbell Rows](http://youtu.be/wGWdrxuP3JY)/[Dumbbell Rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZa2-rOySw)  >* [Pull Ups](http://youtu.be/f11o61rfcsQ?t=12s)/[Lat Pull Down](http://youtu.be/f11o61rfcsQ?t=5m34s)  >* [T-Bar Rows](http://youtu.be/HQm2K5OpEbM?t=19m25s)  >* [Cable Pull Overs](https://instagram.com/p/toFyHkjvKs/?modal=true)  >If you clicked on the videos linked for the exercises above, you’ll notice that almost every single video is linked to Kai Greene.  This was done intentionally because I believe Kai has perfected back training.   When you train a muscle, you need to stretch it, and then contract it.  The [lats are stretched when your arm moves overhead](http://www.leehayward.com/art_pics/stretch/lat_stretch.jpg). It is important to apply this to your rows when you are targeting your lats. Kai demonstrates this perfectly in both his barbell and dumbbell rows.  At the bottom of each rep, he lets the weight hang forward. You can see this [here](http://imgur.com/17zsT3R,ky55uGL#0) on his barbell row, and [here](http://imgur.com/17zsT3R,ky55uGL#1) on his dumbbell row. This type of movement lets you stretch the lats as much as you can during these exercises, which allows for a much better contraction when you pull the weight. You will also notice that he pulls the weight to his stomach. Again, this lets you contract the lats fully. When you pull the weight to your chest, you will be using your upper back at a higher scale than your lats.  Here are the [barbell row ](http://youtu.be/wGWdrxuP3JY) and [dumbbell row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZa2-rOySw) videos again. >Pull Ups are arguably the best lats exercise there is. You can fully stretch the lats through their range of motion and fully contract them as well. I like to super set these with lat pull downs. I like to alter my grip width for both of these exercises regularly to target different parts of my lats/back (yes, I know its broscience, but I believe in it).  Most people believe that pullovers are primarily a chest exercise, but when done correctly, they are an excellent lats exercise. They are also a great way to teach yourself how to really “flare” your lats. >**UPPER BACK TRAINING** >I don’t spend a lot of time specifically on upper back training because I feel that it is hit sufficiently through all of my movements that are targeted for my lats.

When you perform a row, it is important to really squeeze your shoulder blades together to fully work the muscles you want to.  With people who are new to this concept, I like to put a finger in the middle of their back, and tell them to try and squeeze my finger with their shoulder blades with each rep. To fully maximize this, you can [protract your scapula, as seen in image A,](https://johanngfitness.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/band-pull-apart.jpg) at the beginning of a row, which will fully stretch the upper back muscles, and then only squeeze the scapula together when you pull towards yourself. **TL;DR** * Splitting the back into upper back, lats, and traps * When training traps, retract your shoulder blades, and then shrug * Don't roll your shoulders as you shrug * Most of your back training should revolve around lats * Watch Kai Greene's form on dumbbell and barbell rows to learn how to fully engage the lats * Upper back training should emphasize squeezing your scapula as hard as you can ","I find it absolutely hilarious that biceps, triceps, and deltoids all get their own post and then there's ""back""",518

While I was not so shyly eavesdropping, two things occurred to me. The first realization was that neither of my friends were including me in this adventure. The second was why they hadn’t included me. A slow yet consistent thought came to dominate my head. It was the realization that I was not seen by other people as I viewed myself. As that truth unfolded in my mind, I slowly came to the realization that I was living a lie. I believed that I was in shape. I believed I was athletic. I believed I was tough. As much as I believed these things to be true, my friends did not. The realization that my friends didn't think I would be interested in, or able to complete, an obstacle course race was compounded by the fact that I was realizing that my self-image was not accurate. Talk about a shock to the system! The image my brain created and the image my eyes saw in a mirror was not a true representation of who I was. My mind had created a shield. My friends accidentally shattered my manufactured self- image as I quietly looked down into an over filled plate of self-realization. As they talked, and I listened, something happened. Something quick came alive in my head. That something made me say out loud, “I will run it with you,” to the apparent shock of my wife and the rest of the table. Maybe it was denial being pushed into realization. Maybe it was false pride making me say something out of haste. The thought that I was not perceived by the others as I perceived myself was shocking and eye opening to me. The call to arms was sounded, although unintentionally. My brain responded confidently. Whatever it was that made me speak up, I am grateful for it. Now, I had a goal. I had a timeline. I said to myself, ""Quit lying to yourself and get to work. It is time to be the person who you have been pretending to be.” All of these positive affirmations and goal setting were great except for one thing. I had one more realization coming around the bend and it was the most important one yet. Over the following weeks, the barriers that had kept me from making a commitment like this to myself were falling down as the number of sit-ups, pull-ups, and miles I could jog increased. As all the excuses melted away, their absence reveled the one main reason that had kept me from making this commitment before now. I was afraid. I was afraid of failure and comfortable with mediocrity. That fear had paralyzed my ability to achieve anything past the self-imposed limitations that I had lived in for way too long. Gradually, I came to realize that I was showing myself that I could run an obstacle race and not be afraid. The commitment to the physical training and practice of overcoming obstacles led me to a point where the fear of failure was not nearly as strong as the rewarding feeling I received when I climbed my 1st rope, or completed my 1st mile run without stopping. Minor successes were destroying decades old fear and I came to love that feeling. I completed the first obstacle race I ran. The race showed me that I had accomplished something significant. Did I come in first place overall? No. Did I win? Yes. I outran the only opponent I really had when I stood at the starting line – the old me. Needless to say, the commitment I made to myself has stuck. Obstacle racing , the exercise, and diet I have adopted to help me run more in the future will be the vehicle to make me physically and mentally healthier. If I can offer some advice to those people who see themselves in the “old me” description it would be simply this: You don’t need to be able run 6 miles, you don’t need to be able to do 20 burpees, you don’t need to be able to climb a 20 foot rope. You do need to be honest with yourself about why you aren't trying to do the things you really want to do. After all, you are reading this for a reason. I think that reason is you want to try obstacle racing. Trust me, a newbie like you, that you will lose that “old self” mentality very soon and discover a whole new world of possibilities that you never knew were within reach. I hope to see you at a race sometime soon where we can both outrun our old selves.","A little bit of **""how""** would compliment this **""why""** story perfectly. Kudos to you bud. ",431

One that claims that you can’t focus on specific parts of your chest (eg. Upper chest, lower chest, etc), while the other claims that you can.  I am split between the two. You can't completely isolate the upper chest. When you do an incline bench press, your entire chest will be activated.  But I believe that to build muscle, you have to consciously contract the muscle that you are working (known as the mind-muscle connection). Pumping out a bunch of reps on incline bench press might not target your upper chest the way you want it to. But if you perform the incline bench press in a controlled manner, and focus on really contracting/squeezing the top of your chest, you will see a difference. A trick that you can use to learn how to squeeze the muscle is to close your eyes during the set, and visualize exactly what you want your chest to do. Intent is needed to optimally stimulate growth.  >**BARBELLS OR DUMBBELLS?** >Both barbells and dumbbells have their pros and cons.  In general, I have found that barbells are superior for developing overall strength in your pressing, and dumbbells are superior for stimulating growth in your chest. The reason why I prefer dumbbells for growth is because they allow you to go through a greater range of motion than barbells. With dumbbells, you can have your arms wide at the bottom of the movement to fully stretch your chest, and then have your hand close together at the top to fully contract your chest.  With a barbell, you hands are in a fixed location during the entire movement.  It’s much easier to consciously contract the muscle you’re intending to work with dumbbells, and they have actually been shown to reduce triceps involvement when compared to barbell pressing movements (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02640414.2010.543916#.VQhvpoHF9XY).   >A great trick you can use to make dumbbell movements even more effective for your chest is to [pronate your arms](http://groundupstrength.wdfiles.com/local--files/training%3Ahook-grip-versus-alternated-grip-for-deadlifts/forearm-supination-pronation-hand.jpg).  The reason why I do this relates back to the anatomy of the pec major.  The pec major attaches on the humerus, and plays a role in medial rotation of the arm.  Pronating your arm is a great cue to initiate medial rotation of the upper arm.  This allows the chest to be maximally contracted.  This can be seen [here](https://instagram.com/p/0X8azDyDok/).  Notice at the bottom of the lift, the hands move in a supinating motion, and then at the top, the hands pronate. This allows you to stretch your pecs at the bottom of the movement, and then fully contract at the top. >Barbells are great for developing overall strength in your pressing muscles.  When using a barbell, you are can lift more weight, and you are stimulating your triceps and deltoids to a high level, rather than just your chest.  Both of these factors lead to an increase in strength.  >A good chest routine for aesthetic/bodybuilding purposes will include both barbell and dumbbell work.  I would recommend 3-4 movements for your chest, while including incline, flat, and decline work. >**UPPER CHEST TRAINING** >The upper chest is usually the part of the chest that most people are lacking.  The easiest way to target this part of the chest is to train on an incline.  Now, keep in mind that the larger the angle of the incline the more the deltoids will be brought into the movement.  I find that the angle that allows to me to hit my upper chest in the best way is around 40 degrees.  Once I start getting higher than that, I feel fatigue in my deltoids before I feel it in my chest.  >* Incline Dumbbell Bench Press >* Inline Barbell Bench Press >* Incline Dumbbell/Cable Flys >Incline dumbbell press is one of my favourite chest exercises. Dumbbells really allow you to work through the full range of motion, and let you squeeze your chest at the top of each movement.  A mistake that many people make while performing this exercise is hitting the dumbbells together at the top. This usually suggests that you’re not maintaining control over the weight during the entire movement.  Instead, it is best to stop with about an inch between the dumbbells.  This allows for a good contraction while maintaining control of the movement.  >Incline barbell bench press is also a great movement, but I am not too fond of it personally. I find that it places a lot of stress on my shoulders/rotator cuff. Many coaches suggest that it is not necessary to touch the bar to your chest for this exercise. It is best to stop about an inch or two above your chest, because going lower can place unnecessary stress on your rotator cuff.    >Flys are a great exercise. The same trick described under the dumbbell or barbell section with dumbbells can be applied to flys, whether they are on an incline, decline, flat bench, or a machine, This can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibqPdkt6MYk).   >**MIDDLE CHEST TRAINING** >This part of the chest is often associated with flat presses. But remember, to grow the middle of your chest, you cant just perform flat presses without thinking; focus on squeezing the middle of your chest while you press. >* Flat Dumbbell Bench Press >* Flat Barbell Bench Press >* Flat Dumbbell/Cable Flys >* Push Ups >* Chest Dips >Flat barbell bench press is a great exercise for chest development, and allows you to use heavier weights than you would with a dumbbell.  But unlike the incline barbell bench press, you should touch your chest while you perform this movement.  With proper form, going to your chest will not place too much stress on your shoulders.  A common technique used by some lifters is bench pressing with a [wide grip, and flaring their elbows out](http://imgur.com/V0FNK88).  Although this may be effective for chest development, I do not think that the risk it places your shoulders at is worth it.  This puts your shoulders at a very high risk of injury, especially with heavier weights.  Instead, I would recommend someone to bench press with their elbows slightly tucked in, like in the bottom of [this image](http://imgur.com/V0FNK88).  Make sure you don’t tuck your elbows too far in, like in [this image](http://www.roypumphrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/0908-mma-close-grip-press-1.jpg).   >For the flat dumbbell bench press and flys, the same tips from upper chest apply. >Push-ups are great exercise for your chest, no matter what your experience is.  For advanced lifters, they could be a great way to finish of your chest workout, or can go great in a super set with a lift such as flys.  For a beginner, they are a great way to progress on to the bench press, and develop pressing strength before moving on to weights. >**LOWER CHEST TRAINING** >The lower chest is often the most neglected part of ones chest.  >* Decline Dumbbell Bench Press >* Decline Barbell Bench Press >* Decline Dumbbell/Cable Flys >[Dorian Yates](http://www.fitnessandpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dorian-yates-workout-routine-600x330.jpg)  has stated that he believes that the decline barbell bench press is the greatest chest movement for overall chest development.  Some studies have even shown that the decline bench press causes the most activation in the chest when compared to other exercise.  The decline bench press also places significantly less stress on your shoulders than the flat press would, and especially the incline bench press (the more of an incline you are at, the more shoulder involvement. The more of a decline you are at, the less shoulder involvement). Given all of this, I personally do not like the decline bench press because it feels awkward to me.  But if you don’t mind it, I would 100% recommend for this to be a part of your routine. **TL;DR** * There is a dispute over whether you can isolate parts of the chest or not * You can't work only the upper chest for example, but using an incline and consciously focusing on contracting the upper chest will really benefit you.   * Dumbbells are great for muscle growth and barbells for strength development. * Incorporate both for an optimal routine * A cool trick with dumbbells or cables you can use is to pronate your hands at the top of the movement    ",">crtl+f ""dips"" >0 of 0 thread fails",1021
2zleuq,"There have been a few ""Anatomical Guide to Training"" posts recently, full of anatomical complexities, and training advice intended for you, the user base of /r/Fitness. I don't want to discuss these guides here regardless of any errors or misinformation you may perceive in them - that's not the point (*see edit below*). --- These guides are not what any novice level trainee needs. /u/Strikerrjones [says this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2zh7ah/chest_101_an_anatomical_guide_to_training/cpj7t8b) much better than I can: > All of these guides are making it way more complicated than it actually is, and so people are beginning to feel dependent on the author.

There are right and wrong ways to do things, not ""it depends"", not alternative theories based on new science that we need to investigate or try. Basic do's and don't's that never change. Unfortunately, these fundamental training principles are lost to many, and stumbling over them is like finding a needle in a haystack. On the same topic [Stan Efferding](http://npcnewsonline.com/powerbuilding-you-dont-grow-in-the-gym/63930/) says: > It really is this simple: > > Lift heavy weights three times a week for an hour.

I’d love to be able to just stop there and trust that the person asking the question will do exactly those two things and get huge and strong. > > But, there’s always a million nit picky questions to follow, the answers to which really make very little difference.  As a novice trainee, the one thing you do not need is additional complexity. You need to find a program created by someone who knows what they are doing **who has already taken this complexity into account** and follow it. With time, you may learn new things, and this is entirely fine, as long as it doesn't detract from the program you are following. The most important thing you can do is to just train hard and well, and do it consistently. If you want to learn about the body check out [ExRx](http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_system). **Edit:** There appears to be a massive misreading of the second sentence of this post ([see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2zleuq/training_101_why_you_dont_need_anatomical_guides/cpkmz3x)).

2zpgt2,"Originally posted in /r/bodybuilding, was suggested it could be useful/spark a good discussion over here too. I get up relatively early to go to the gym, usually around 5:30 - 6:00. It's not ideal, but it's the only way I can guarantee myself a workout. It's hard to get up, and when I do my brain no work good. Over the past year or so of doing this consistently I've tried to tweak my routine to make the path to getting in the gym as easy as possible (especially important in the middle of winter).  For example:  1. When it's cold, I make sure to wear a long-sleeved shirt to bed. Makes leaving the cocoon of warmth in the AM much easier.  2. I lay my clothes out the night before. Leave hoodie in kitchen, have jacket hanging on door, shoes underneath it.  3. Have fresh fruit and yogurt waiting for me in the fridge. Fruit is the easiest thing for me to eat in the morning, and there's zero prep time.  4. Pound water like it's my job.  5. Make coffee the night before, ice that ish, have it ready to slug in the AM. If I'm feeling ambitious, I'll make ice cubes out of coffee so my iced coffee gets more iced coffee as it iced coffees. Feel me?  6. Have keys, wallet, watch, headphones in a little pile by the door. Scoop and it up and head out.  7. Also, (try to) get enough sleep.  Not only is all this stuff nice to have when you're going through the motions, knowing you've got an organized morning prepped makes it way easier to get out of the covers in the first place.

You do. A lot of people don’t do direct core work because they believe that squats and deadlifts will hit their core sufficiently.  This would be similar to not training biceps directly because they are hit during your back workout. While it is true that these exercises do involve a high level of core activation, direct work will be very beneficial, not only for aesthetic purposes, but also for strength.  Elite powerlifters and weightlifters squat and deadlift (or some variation of them) almost every single day, yet they still do direct core work.  [Here](https://youtu.be/EraSU_9X-XI?t=3m5s) is Konstantin Konstantinovs, an elitle powerlifter, training his core directly.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdH8vIVFi4Q&spfreload=10) is Apti Aukhadov, an elite weightlifter, doing direct ab work. If these guys, who train for strength, feel the need to train their core, so should you. >**ABS TRAINING**   >A common question that people have when it comes to training abs is “How can I bring up my lower abs?”.  The scientific answer to this is that you can’t.  The abs, both lower and upper, are one muscle.  Either the entire muscle contracts, or none of it contracts.  >Visibility of abs is another very common concern.  Most of you have probably heard the following quote, “Abs are made in the kitchen”.  This has some truth to it. For your abs to be visible, you have to be at a certain body fat (usually below 10%). But that does not mean you shouldn’t train your abs.  Just like any other muscle, the more you work your abs, the larger they will grow.  So by working your abs, you can increase the body fat percentage that it will take for them to be visible at (maybe instead of having to be at 10% to see your abs, you can be at 12% and see them).   >As I’ve mentioned in previous 101 posts, to work a muscle optimally, you have to fully stretch a muscle, and then fully contract it. The abs are stretched when the spine is extended, and are flexed when the spine is flexed.  >* [Crunches](https://youtu.be/1V4RXxLHNCY?t=1m52s)  >* [Cable Crunches](https://youtu.be/h1nvxfWlWgM?t=1m53s)  >* [Hanging Leg Raises](https://youtu.be/CRIDhu-Ylbk?t=1m30s)  >Crunches are probably the most popular abs exercise there is, and rightfully so.  They are extremely effective and targeting the muscle. Doing crunches on the ground can limit the stretch you can achieve in your abs.  To combat this, it can be very beneficial to perform crunches on an exercise ball instead.  IFBB Pro Ben Pakulski demonstrates how he performs crunches on an exercise ball [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9WmOBRI54U&spfreload=10).  >Cable crunches are another great exercise.  These are my personal favorite ab exercise.  What separates these from normal crunches is that you can use some heavier weights while doing these.  More weight has been shown to correlate with more muscle growth.  It is also very easy to get a great stretch and contraction with this variation of the crunch.  >Hanging leg raises can be done in a number of different ways for people at different levels.  A beginner can do a variation such as [this](https://youtu.be/gtpfi4btmag?t=22s), whereas advanced individuals can do something like [this](https://youtu.be/RfgWnoPoo-o?t=37s). Progressions that people can use for these are: back support and knees to chest, back support and legs to chest, no back support and knees to chest, and then no back support and legs to chest.   >**OBLIQUES TRAINING** >These are the muscles that you want to train to get that [“V” muscle](http://www.peckmeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/obliques.jpg) people try to achieve.  >* [Woodchoppers](https://youtu.be/pAplQXk3dkU?t=1m34s) >* [Side Crunches](https://youtu.be/jINgwwDTeOw?t=2m31s) >* [Side Bends](https://youtu.be/HCkte7H1hIc?t=33s)  >Woodchoppers are a great exercise and target the obliques by utilizing their rotational function.  These also allow you to use heavier weights, which can be very beneficial to muscular growth.  >Side crunches and side bends utilize the obliques through their side flexion function.  Side crunches are a really great way to really feel your obliques working, and are an exercise that allows you to maintain a high amount of control. >Keep in mind that the obliques also flex the spine forwards, so they will be used in all exercises that target the abs as well. >**ERECTOR SPINAE** >The erector spinae are a very powerful and important muscle.  The development of this muscle is extremely important for strength related sports, such as weightlifters, due to the fact that it plays a massive role in cleans and snatches, and also is very important for overhead movements.  The erector spinae are trained through extending the spine. >* [Hyperextensions](https://youtu.be/nuHJYKUapZw?t=31s)  >* [Slow Negative Deadlifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQnEVoRG9gw&spfreload=10)  >* [Back Crunches](https://youtu.be/jINgwwDTeOw?t=6m26s)  >Hyperextensions are an amazing way to strengthen your lower back. The video linked above for hyperextensions is an advanced version. These can be done with just your bodyweight, or by holding a plate to your chest. If you can get a barbell to your back, then you can mimic the video, but it is not essential to use a barbell.  >Slow negative deadlifts are my favourite lower back exercise.  Try to make the negative portion last 5+ seconds, and your lower back will be on fire.  When you are lowering the weight at a slow rate, your erector spinae will be fighting like crazy to keep your spine from flexing/rounding. >**OVERALL CORE TRAINING** >Remember that the function of the core overall is to stabilize and keep the spine straight.  There are great exercises to target your core as a whole as well. >* [Stir the Pot](https://youtu.be/3EuMtm2MzRA?t=4s)  >* [Ab Roll-Outs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA2QGI0NPWU&spfreload=10)  >* [Planks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSHjTRCQxIw&spfreload=10)  >* [Pallof Press](https://instagram.com/p/vEX4cuKEKR/) >All of the above exercises have one thing in common.  They strengthen the function of the core by requiring you to keep your spine straight and stable the entire time.  They have great carryover for both athletic and aesthetic purposes. **TL;DR** * The core is composed of many muscles  * The core as a whole functions to stabilize the spine * Abs function is to flex the spine forwards * Obliques flex the spine forwards and laterally, and rotate the spine * Erector Spinae extend the spine * Direct ab work is very beneficial for all training purposes     ",Came back after the shit storm last time.

30mqw3,"About five years ago I was diagnosed with anorexia. Went through some hospital treatments and nothing worked. One day I decided to get my shit together. Got myself a gym card and fell in love with the weights. Here's my journey so far! &nbsp; **S T A T S** weight | age | gender | height | --------|------|---------|--------| 44 kg --> 60 kg | 17 --> 18 y/o | female | 168 cm | &nbsp; **P R O G R E S S** deadlift | benchpress | squat | military press | ---------|--------------|--------|----------------| 30 kg --> 95 kg x 3 rep | 13 kg --> 47,5 kg x 5 rep | 20 kg --> 78 kg x 3 rep | 10 kg --> 30 kg x 3 rep | &nbsp; **D I E T** Before: During my periods of starvation I limited my intake to about <400 kalories per day. I went trough different periods in terms of what food I ate. One period I lived of McDolalds chicken nuggets and diet coke. Another period I only ate toasted white bred, one period I only had lf milk with cereal and so on. Once I got in to the fitness kind of lifestyle I increased my food intake a little bit, ate healthy but basically no carbs, except veggies.  &nbsp; During/Now: I increased my calories successively; 1000 --> 1300 --> 1700 --> 1900 --> 2200 --> 2500 and ended with a clean bulk on **2700 calories**. I weighted my food and counted every calorie through this period. Also tried playing around with IIFYM. Now I don't count any calories, macros or weight my food. I eat 5 meals/day, all healthy foods, but once a week I treat myself with a big plate of sushi. **LOVE SUSHI!** I'm thinking about trying intermittent fasting or limiting my meals to 3 big ones per day because I've read a lot of research about it and it seems like a good way to improve health and body composition. &nbsp; **T R A I N I N G** Before: Same as with the food. I went trough different periods. Some I ran long distance, some I didn't move from my room and so on. &nbsp; During/Now: Started with whole body workouts together with 20 min cardio about 2-3 times per week. Moved on to upper/lower body split, 3split and then 4split. 4 split was the worst one and my strength no longer improved. *""But this is how all the bodybuilders train!?""* Silly me. Now I'm on a upper/lower body split again training 4 times a week and it's working great! My strength is improving every week and well, a guy at the gym referred to me as ""the bear"" :) I start every workout with a compound movement. About 5 warmup sets and then 3-4 heavy sets with 3-5 reps. Then I lower the weight and do 3 sets with 8-10 reps before I move on to a different exercise. Upper-body workouts have 2 push and 2 pull movements, lower-body workouts are a mix of hammies/glutes and quads fokusing more on the back side of my legs because I'm trying to fix my pelvic tilt. &nbsp; **P I C T U R E S / V I D E O** before: [http://imgur.com/a/aFpFS] after: [http://imgur.com/a/8vE3C#0] &nbsp; Video of squat/deadlift https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1x6vXfsVPM&feature=youtu.be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqI6EUjfTQo&feature=youtu.be &nbsp; **EDIT:** I would like to thank you all for your super kind comments.

31gzxe,"First off I want to say THANKS to all of you who have overcome the nerves to post pictures and progress posts. All of the information on here has been great but seeing people help others by posting has given me the courage to do the same.  There are really two stories within this post. For most of my life I have been over 200 pounds. I actually just found some old pictures (mainly what made me feel the need to post for others who might be scared) where I was my heaviest. [THESE](http://imgur.com/a/Lbwvy) are from my trip to San Fran in 2007 and [THESE](http://imgur.com/a/KGpTl) are from 2011. Don't really know what weight Im at but I'm guessing around 200 as I had logged it in MyFitnessPal that year. I had horrible eating habits and was mostly eating once or twice a day due to stress and having a horrible schedule of 2 jobs and school. I tried for a little bit to log my food but never stuck to it. Over the next few years my weight would go up and down but when I started working out last year I was 185: **AUGUST** [185](http://imgur.com/a/mfGOc) I really have no explanation as to why I started working out. I think it was just a challenge to myself, or just get rid of extra energy but once I started I never (and still haven't) stopped. I logged my food and weight on MyFitnessPal from day one but of course fell into the trap of it telling me what my goals should be so my goal was 1200 calories a day and I started walking on the treadmill for about an hour a day 6 days a week.  I religiously weigh and track my food. I had always loved healthy food so it wasn't a huge transition for me and going to culinary school helped me create healthy meals. I didn't have any clue about my macros for the first few months so all I did was focus on just eating 1200 calories. From looking back in MyFitnessPal I could tell that my carbs were super high and was most likely the reason I could run and walk as much as I did.   **SEPTEMBER** [171](http://imgur.com/a/sEhk5) Started doing faster walking on the treadmill and incorporated WII dancing as well into my 6 days. I had a full time job with odd hours so I would workout at different times but still made it a habit to get on that treadmill for at least 45 minutes Saturday through Thursday.   **OCTOBER** [159](http://imgur.com/a/mhoSr) [09.30.14 **161**](http://imgur.com/hYtLPcm) )I eventually wanted to see if I could actually run on the treadmill and slowly started increasing my speed. I sort of set a goal to get to 145 and was well on my way. [10.27.14 **154**](http://imgur.com/3mAYjqf)   **NOVEMBER** [150 Halloween](http://imgur.com/S5AMCDE) Unfortunately I didn't keep up with the monthly progress pics but took enough bathroom pictures to keep track lol. Mid November I hit my goal of 145 but of course I wasn't happy and set a new goal of getting to 135 by Christmas. By then I was well immersed in the fitness subreddit and was addicted to finding out as much info as I could. I told myself that if I could get to 135 I would start lifting weights and ease up on the cardio.    **DECEMBER**  Don't have any pictures of November through December but at this point I'm running every day for half of the workout time. By Christmas I had hit my goal of 135 and had already begun researching what I wanted to do in the form of lifting. Of course with all the success I had been having with cardio I didn't want to get rid of it entirely so I did a bit of it before and after my ""workouts"".  I was still eating only 1200 calories.  **JANUARY-FEBRUARY** [135 01.08.15](http://imgur.com/XtETEFS) I knew from reading more information that eating 1200 calories probably wasn't the best thing to do.  I was going through some emotional things during this month and lost my job so eating was all over the place. I jumped back up to 140 but by the end of January I was back down to 135. Throughout Januray and February I was all over the place with diet as for a whole month I stayed 135--low carb, high carb, low protein, high protein--I was so focused on my weight going down that I just tried everything week to week. I would increase my calories one week and a little bit of weight would come off then come back on. I had no energy on the low carb diet and noticed that for the previous months it had been high and I was still losing weight so I increased them. So beginning of FEB I had [THIS](http://imgur.com/FhzRGXU) as my macros which wasn't working at all since I stalled for a month. So increased the calories even more to: 1450, 163C 40F, 109P. I eventually lost 5 more pounds. I found JEFIT and started doing a small weight lifting routine through it. I only had dumbells and a ProForm home gym so I incorporated some random exercises here and there as I had no idea what I was doing.My treadmill eventually broke so I eventually just had a stationary bike to work with. I was still scared to leave cardio out of the equation as now the weight was coming off more slowly.  I officially hit 130 midway through February and was ecstatic.  [02.12.15](http://imgur.com/QejqBfg,9IYjpCJ) [2.16.15](http://imgur.com/hmebHop) **MARCH-TODAY** [Hovering around 130]() My weight was/is constantly going up and down a few pounds. I was so used to the weight falling off that I started freaking out and over analyzing **EVERYTHING**. By the end of February the lowest I had gone was 128 but it continues to go up and down. I eventually got rid of all the cardio and started a tighter lifting regime which you can see [here](http://www.jefit.com/2643983).  [THIS](http://imgur.com/a/Kauox) Is me today. Currently 131 and still have some loose skin on my belly. I didn't photoshop any of these pictures as I wanted to show what it looks like to still have stretch marks.  I'm still a work in progress and still learning every day from things you guys post on here, so please keep it up! **DIET** The first three months was semi-clean eating with lots of chicken, salads and veggies. I still had a cheat day on Fridays (my only off day) where i would eat a little bit over the 1200 calorie limit. Before XMAS I had been reading about the importance of protein intake and with my new lifting mindset I set my goal pretty high (135g due to my weight at the time) and was able to meet it pretty easily since I received a huge bag of whey for xmas. Other than that I filled it in with eggs, chicken, beans and cottage cheese or yogurt. My carbs were either fruit, veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts) or brown rice. I LOVE spinach and still eat at least a bag of it a week. Like I've said I over-analyze everything so I'm still tweaking my macros since I'm focusing on heavier weights now. I love avocados and that is my main fat source other than egg yolks and nuts. I still have pizza every now and then and try to fill my sweet tooths with shakes with sugar free syrups or even protein powder ice cream concoctions.  **ROUTINE** **Sunday**: Legs & Abs: Dumbbell walking lunges (3x8 @ 40lbs), leg extensions (3x8 @ 105), glute kickback, lying leg curls, standing calf raises(3x10 @150), smith machine squat (3x8 @ 110), cable one leg kickback (3x8 @ 25), plank, dumbbell side bend (3x8 @ 25). **Monday**: Back and Biceps: dumbbell one arm row (3x8 @ 30), dumbbell twisting standing curl(3x8 @ 20), dumbbell hammer curls, dumbbell alternate bicep curl, cable rope seated row(3x9 @70), wide grip lat pulldown(3x10 @60), dumbbell reverse grip incline bench row. **Tuesday**: Shoulders & Abs: dumbbell arnold press (3x8 @20), dumbbell front raise(3x8 @ 15), barbell shrug(3x8 @ 140), weight plate front raise(3x10@25), air bike, crunches, weight plate twist(3x30 @ 25), plank, dumbbell see saw press, toe touchers. **Wednesday**: Chest & Triceps: bench dip, push up, dumbbell incline fly(3x8 @20), dumbbell tricep kickback (3x10 @20), smith machine bench press (3x8@70), dumbbell one arm tricep extension, butterfly(3x10@50), dumbbell close grip press. **Thursday**: Legs & Glutes: Glute kickback, standing calf raises (3x10 @150), single leg curl (3x8 @ 25), smith machine deadlift (3x10 @ 130), smith machine lunge (3x8 @ 110), band good morning, bodyweight lunge. **Friday** OFF DAY **Saturday** Usually swim, HIIT on the bike, or sometimes extra ab workouts or chest (pushups) as I'm pretty weak in that area.  **SUGGESTIONS/CRITIQUES**I'm still unsure of what to do as far as macros as my weight isn't really moving (and yes I know the number won't change if I'm getting leaner). I need to stop focusing on the number on the scale and look at my body. Posting this has helped me see that but I still love critiques and ANY help with this is welcome. I know all about IIFYM and keep psyching myself out on which is the best way to go since all I'm doing now are weights. Like I've said my weight has been going up and down 1-2 pounds for about a month now so I'm kind of stuck on what to do. I'm currently eating [THIS](http://imgur.com/rngyWL6) to see if increasing my cals again will help me lose fat while lifting. I really want to get rid of my little belly and wondering if you all agree that its just extra skin. **GOING FORWARD** I hope to lower my body fat and work on building some muscle.  Any critiques on my workout regime are welcome as well. Like i've said I am a work in progress and all your comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks again guys for hearing my rant! TL;DR: [Before](http://imgur.com/a/mfGOc)...[After](http://imgur.com/a/Kauox) Still a work in progress. **EDIT**WOW GUYS & GALS!! You are all a real help in keeping my faith in this subreddit. I really hope that I have helped those who said so. To those that thought I looked great before, I thought I did to! I never hated my body just wanted to challenge myself to see what I could do. This definitely isn't my stopping point either. I just wanted to get some insight on a few things and perhaps in the process show those who are stuck that it can be accomplished. I will definitely keep posting. I think I'm going to start tinkering with bodyweight fitness as I don't want to teach myself bad habits with the smith machine. I'm hoping someday I can afford a gym membership or a proper rack and be able to start 5x5's. Again, THANK YOU all for your kind words, great tips, detailed replies and reassurance that /r/fitness is always here to help!    ",That ass went from fat to phat!,862

3231dx,"Having read a few articles recently [like this one from Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexmorrell/2015/03/12/lawsuits-say-protein-powders-lack-protein-ripping-off-athletes/) regarding companies amino spiking their protein powders to increase their profit margins, I had an idea to do some of my own investigation.      How interested is the fitness community in some non-biased testing? It would not be completed for some time, as I'm away from my research facility for most of the summer, but nonetheless. Really just curious about it, wondering if you guys would be as well (gauging interest to see if it's worth my time).      --      **Edit:** Wow! Overwhelming response! I will definitely look into methodology over my break and work up some sort of experimental scheme for this. I found [an older post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/uva9t/big_reddit_protein_powder_measurement_results) that had done something similar. I'd like to do what he did with the samples coming from the Reddit community, since I don't have a multitude of powders at my disposal. I'll try and contact that author, and several others from similar studies/attempts as a start. I will make a new post in the future when things get underway.      Just to reiterate, I'll be collecting samples from the Fititt crowd for my testing when I do get to it. If I can develop a quick and reliable testing protocol, I'll do as many samples as I'm given.      --      **Edit2:** There appears to be a good amount of online resources already available that do similar testing. My issue here is that after browsing for a few minutes, it looks like they don't test for specifically whey content. They report 'total protein', which is exactly the phrase I want to tackle. I want to see how much of the 30g of protein is really the protein it should be, aminated fillers, etc. Plus, you can't be sure that money isn't landing in someone's pocket for these tests. A big lab that does 'hundreds of analyses on top protein powders' has very large operation costs- who's paying for the testing?",https://labdoor.com/rankings I'm quite sure these guys do exactly what you're askimg,427
328i6c,"I know this is a controversial topic but this needs to be said. No disrespect to actual powerlifters - you guys are pimp as hell. This is for the beginners who were told to do Starting Strength + GOMAD. **Stop powerlifting** * Be honest with yourself. Picking up weights is often part of a general trend of self-improvement. Your mind doesn't like the idea that you're improving yourself - it implies your current self isn't up to par. This is why you rationalize going to the gym in other ways than wanting to better your looks. ""I don't care about having big muscles, I just like lifting weights"". ""Fuck these bros doing brosplits, I just want to squat heavy"". ""I think I might go to a PL event"". If you had to pick between increasing your squat by 100kg and gaining 12lbs of muscle, what would you pick? * Don't listen to the broscience. The myth that training your entire body releases hormones which stimulate growth everywhere has been [debunked](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/research-review/physiological-elevation-of-endogenous-hormones-results-in-superior-strength-training-adaptations-research-review.html/). Squatting heavy won't make your biceps grow. * Look at the weekly volume in SS. Legs: 70. Shoulders: 22. Chest: 22. Upper back: 22. Does this seem aligned with your goals? **Instead** * Equal pushing (bench + press), pulling (pull-up + row), and legs volume. Aim for ~60-120 (lyle mcd's rec) per week for each. Upper / lower 4 days a week, full / body, push pull legs, it doesn't really matter, do what's most convenient for your schedule, just don't push, pull, or legs two days in a row. * Consider adding isos for bis, shoulders, and chest (curls, face pulls + lat raises, flies), because push exercises are tricep dominant, and pull exercises are back dominant. * Consider leg exercises that are more aligned with general balanced strength and physique than powerlifting (front squat + RDL emphasize anterior and posterior chain respectively, ie they will get you abs and glutes, whereas the powerlifts are all posterior chain heavy). Do you have anterior pelvic tilt from the strong lower back and weak abs you get doing low-bar squat-mornings three times a week? Switching to front squats will fix this. * Keep the good parts of beginner PL programs: heavy strength work and consistent progression with a fixed scheme rather than playing it by ear. * Don't make all your work sets of 5 or you will burn out and spend ages having to rest. Do some heavy strength work first, and follow it up with higher rep sets for volume. Base the weights for all your sets off percentages of your 1RM, and have a progression scheme for your 1RM (weekly, biweekly, every workout, whatever floats your boat / matches your experience level). **Cutting**  * Cutting forces you to actually pay attention to what you eat rather than just eating a shitton under the excuse that you're 'bulking'. If you start by successfully getting lean, you will have reached a point where fitness is part of your lifestyle and you  have the discipline to stick to it. * Cutting to low body fat makes your face and body look better. Gaining muscle mass when you're not lean doesn't make you look much better until you cut later on. * Low body fat makes it easier to gain mass, and it makes your gains more apparent, which is important for motivation. * After a cut you are ready to slow bulk.

32kgsa,"Hey guys! Some of you probably remember when I first introduced my little sister and pupil, Michelle, on here after she hit her first 315 pound deadlift last August. Well, last week she hit another huge landmark by pulling a solid 350 pound deadlift at a body weight of 140 - 2.5 times her own body weight. [Here's 315lbs from last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBp7nbfDzp8)  [Here's the 350lbs PR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgvgzLRflc) I also found this 350 to be significant because it's exactly double what she could deadlift when she first started, which is kind of cool. As for her training, we kind of revamped things after she pulled the 315. We adjusted her technique a bit (compare the 315 to the 350: 350 has a more compact stance, a slightly narrower grip, utilization of the stretch reflex, the pull is no longer initiated by ""yanking"" the bar from the floor, etc.) and we got her a real powerlifting belt. We wanted to give her some time to get used to the new technique and break in the belt somewhat/get a feel for it, so we started off the cycle pretty light at 225lbs, which was about 70% of her maximum at the time. We ran a basic 5x5 once a week, adding 5 pounds each session. We did this until she got up to somewhere around 265-270 for 5 sets of 5, if I recall correctly. At this point we changed things up a bit. Instead of running a linear progression we switched to more of a ""ramping"" style to increase the intensity. The goal was to work up to a heavy set of 3 each session. After she hit the heaviest triple of the day we would take 30-50lbs off the bar and knock out a few more sets of 3 to accrue some more volume. We ran this progression style for the next several months until she pulled 320lbs for a solid set of 3. At this point we decided to test the deadlift with the goal of hitting 350. During this time period she was also squatting twice a week, one heavy and one volume day, as well doing some benching/pullups twice a week after each squat session. She also does some form of cardio 2-3 times a week, but she does that on her own so I don't know too much about it.  As for where we go from here, I think we will continue to train with the ramping style for a little bit longer and see if she can eek out a bit more progress that way. The short term goal is obviously to get that extra quarter on the bar by pulling 365. I think she can do that if we continue with this cycle. After that we will most likely start all over again with a new training cycle by dropping back down to the 70% range. The goal then will be the big 4 plate landmark. I know she can get there, she just needs a few more years under her belt. But I've always talked about it as an inevitability rather than a possibility and so I'm pretty sure there isn't a doubt in her mind that she will get it soon enough. Anyway, if you have any questions about her training feel free to ask me!","I remember I had hit 315 for the first time the night before you posted her 315 PR. Your sister and I are progressing at about the same rate -- I just hit 365. The main difference? I am a 6'3"" 215 pound ""man,"" lol. Props to your sister! ",921

I burn 1,300 calories on my rest day not doing a damn thing except shoppin at Khols or something. So if you take the remaining 3,200 and divided it by roughly 10 hours you get 320 cals/hr.

35r0do,"# Preface This post will answer that question rather definitively. This post will cover the bare essentials. I see people asking, and I get asked how to run faster all the time. I am going to try and provide a bare minimum of solid background and combine it with the practical how-to steps for running faster. I will strongly lean on two of the most credible sources of running literature I know of: Daniel's Running Formula, 3E and The Lore of Running (Noakes). These books have a sterling reputation and represent the best of the science and accumulated anecdotal wisdom of the running world.  There is no one ""accepted"" training plan. Even among experts there is a lot of variation. However, at the core there are certain key workouts that almost all elites use. I will focus on these basics and how you can incorporate them into a running program to run faster.  Who is this guide for? Anyone who wants to run faster. Specifically, you should be willing to dedicate about four to five hours per week to running and it should be the focus of your training program. You can and should do resistance training, but I am just going to focus on people who want their primary exercise to be running.  # Why do some people run faster? First, it is important to understand why an elite endurance athlete can perform the way they perform. Why can two runners follow an exact regimen of exercise, diet, and sleep and have dramatically different running performances?  * Biomechanics -- Some runners are more efficient and can go faster at a given level of energy expenditure * Oxygen -- Some runners (VO2 Max) can just suck more oxygen into their bodies * Blood -- Some runners have more hemoglobin and can do more with less oxygen * Lactate Turnpoint -- How quickly do you accumulate lactate in your blood at a given intensity and the inflection point of when it increases dramatically Bob, this is complicated, what the heck does this all mean? Simply put, this can be very easily thought of as running economy. For a given amount of oxygen consumption, how fast can you run? The answer to this question is your ""running economy"" and it is a key concept. The bad news, your VO2 max is close to set in stone and even if you train really hard for a long time you will not be able to increase how much oxygen you consume by very much. Genetically, some people are low and high responders to training so there is some variance, but not a lot. Alas, do not despair, you can still train all these other systems I mentioned and become a much, much faster runner.  ""The best athletes are usually the most economical athletes (Noakes 1988)."" -- Lore of running. Noakes is also a proponent that running economy is hugely important, possibly more so than VO2 Max.  # All about that base So, if you can't improve your VO2 Max, you are training something else to go faster. The overview is simple. You have to start running, probably more than you are. Runners that run more miles in training increase their economy. There is a lot we don't know about running economy, but, basically, you need to run a lot. We aren't talking about intensity or anything like that yet. How much you can run depends on where you are as a runner. The goal is to slowly increase the mileage your body can tolerate.  Ideally you can run at least 4 times per week 2-6 miles at an easy pace. If you can't that is ok, this advice and knowledge works just fine for you as well! **Easy**, meaning you can still carry on a conversation and on perceived effort scale of 1-5 you are chilling out at 2. For 3-4 weeks, you should do a bulk of easy running with no hard efforts. This prepares your body and gives you a ""mileage base"" or ""fitness base"" to work from. It encourages a tremendous number of beneficial adaptations and gets your body ready to do harder efforts without becoming injured. For untrained runners 4-12 weeks of easy running might even be beneficial. You, basically, want to do easy running as long as your fitness is improving (and as long as you can stand it).  Once your improvement levels off with the amount of easy running you can do, it is time to sharpen. And to understand sharpening we will first look at the systems we target when we perform harder running efforts. Let me also say that, if you are a starting runner and find running more than 2-3 miles too difficult, try fast walking. Our goal is to work at 75-80% of our max heart rate (usually a 2 on the perceived effort scale). If you can do that with fast (15:00 walking), do that! You can also cycle between running and walking in the same exercise, just realize you are probably doing something that is ""high intensity"" to your body if you are just starting running.  # What is lactate? Many people talk about lactic acid. Few people bother to learn what we have studied about it. I will talk about lactate as lactate threshold is something that gets used a lot in training plans (threshold runs). Lactate, not lactic acid, is a product of glycolysis. Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose precursors into pyruvate. Pyruvate (or possibly just pure lactate) is then used by your body as energy (not quite, but close enough for our purposes). This happens in both the aerobic and ""anaerobic"" energy systems. As exercise intensity increases, blood lactate increases. The more carbs you burn the more lactate you get. That is what lactate in your blood means.  ""Lactate is a key fuel in the body for exercise. Lactate does not cause fatigue, muscle craps, the stitch, or post exercise muscle soreness (Brooks 1998)."" -- Lore of Running. You produce lactate as a result of carbohydrate metabolism. You can observe lactate in the blood, gauge your carb burn rate and make some meaningful guesses about an individual's running performance. # What about fat as energy?  At any race pace faster than half marathon pace you don't really use fat as energy at a significant level. You can't really adapt your lactate turning point maximally training at slower paces. If burning fat is your goal the slower you go, to a point, the more energy you use from fat, but it is a more complicated process than the anaerobic glycolysis we just discussed. We won't go further here, but you do use fat as fuel at lower intensities.  # Lactate Turnpoint and Other Adaptations Basically, there is an amount of blood lactate present right when you cross from mild exercise to more intense exercise. This amount, when graphed creates a sort of visual ""Lactate Turnpoint"". The observation, which turns out to be quite accurate is that, ""the exercise intensity that can be sustained for 42km (Marathon-ish Distance) is very close to the intensity at which blood lactate concentrations first begin to rise above values present during mild exercise."" So, the idea is that if we can increase our pace at the point at which this turn point occurs, we can increase our overall timed running performance on longer efforts.  Unfortunately lactate turn point is relatively difficult to measure and not of practical use, other than as a theoretical underpinning based on the types of training that increase it. Other useful adaptations occur with high intensity training, but this is one of the key ones that occurs. Many, many other beneficial adaptations occur: Liver glycogen stores increase, the mitochondria in your body adapt, your body grows more capillaries, you can increase your VO2 Max some of the time, you use more fat and decrease glycogen used during exercise at all work rates. Basically, a lot of good things happen.  # High Intensity Training When I talk about high intensity training I am thinking of training that is at 3-5 on a perceived effort scale. What types of high intensity running are there and what do they accomplish? * Sprinting -- Anaerobic, improves biomechanics, foot turnover and certain metabolic adaptations * Intense Intervals -- Maximum effort you can sustain for 200-1600 meters, repeated a number of times in a workout. Increases lactate turn point, running economy. Improves muscle glycogen usage.  * Tempo Intervals -- Maximum effort you can sustain for 1-6 miles. As a beginner tempo work is usually a couple of miles with a break in the middle.  * ""Marathon"" pace and work that is harder than easy. Think 2.5-3.5 on the intensity scale * Easy pace -- 1.5-2 on the perceived effort scale. 70-80% of the miles you will likely run. Generally, after you have a base under your feet and you are gearing up for a timed event of some sort, you should spend 18-12 weeks in a running program that incorporates Sprinting, Intense Intervals and Tempo Intervals, along with your bulk of easy running. The longer your race effort (Marathon, for example) the more you might emphasize long tempo work. The shorter (say a 2 mile military PT time trial) the more you want to focus on Sprinting and Intense Intervals. However, don't think that because you are running a marathon intense intervals don't belong in your training program. The adaptations that occur there will make you a faster marathoner (See: lactate turn point we talked about earlier). Or, an anecdotal view point: The fastest 5K and 10K runners also tend to be the fastest marathoners.  # Building a training program At this point we can build a simple training program. You don't even really need me to tell you more, we have laid out most of the first principles. A good training program for runners with 1-3 years of experience incorporates the following:   * Rest weeks, weeks where intensity drops. Usually every 3rd or 4th week. Prevents overtraining. Good practice unless you really know your body and what you are doing  * A base phase of 4-12 weeks of easy running only  * Intervals and Tempo work tuned to your desired distance  * Sprints and other economy drills (strides, butt-kicks, and other small things). Sprints are very short, BTW, about 50-60 meters at level 5 on the intensity scale. Do 3-8 of them to finish off an easy run. Rest completely after each one so that it is intense but in no way a real challenge # OK, but Bob you haven't told me enough details! Okay. I am sorry. At this point we have just covered what many books have covered, but we had to skip a lot of practical details. So, let's build a running program for a hypothetical runner. Her name is Jill. She wants to run a really fast two miles for a military PT exam. She has 12 weeks to prepare. She can generally run 5 miles at an easy pace. She has come to me to help coach her and build a training plan. The first thing I will have Jill do is run an all out 5K. An all out 5K is an excellent predictor of running fitness. To figure out training paces, always run an all out mile or 5K. The longer the distance you can run all out, the more accurate the training paces will be.  Next I bang along through my Daniels Running Formula book, figuring Jill will run about 20-25 miles per week over about 4 to 5 runs. I want Jill to do track repeats (Intervals) and Tempo work. You can use tables like those found in Daniels or tools like this one (http://www.runnersworld.com/tools/training-paces-calculator). You can also find Daniel's formula in spreadsheets. Let's say Jill ran a 25:00 5K. Her easy run pace will be in the neighborhood of 10:00-11:00/mi, but we just let whatever feels good (2.0/5.0 on effort scale) dictate her easy run pace. We will have her run two ""Quality"" runs each week.  First: 3 repeats at threshold (turn point) pace, one mile in length each. Roughly 8:30 pace. Warm up 10 minutes. Cool down 10 minutes. Easy pace for warm-up and cool down. Rest for one minute in between each repeat.  Second: 1K repeats. 6 of them. Slightly faster than threshold pace. Call it 8:15. Because Jill is a beginner we have a choice to make here. We could have her run at her interval pace, but we can probably get the same adaptation sticking around her threshold pace. So we aim for work that is a little more intense, but in a 1K repeat format.  As time goes on we keep one of the threshold runs, perhaps increasing the total distance ran at threshold pace. Then we take the workout that was 1K repeats and may slowly increase the pace to be closer to interval pace as her fitness improves. Realistically it doesn't matter a lot! We have to monitor Jill's progress and see how she is feeling as she does this work. We also advise Jill to do one longer run of 40-50 minutes every week. Whatever mileage is left over after quality work and a longer effort is run spread out however Jill likes in easy runs.  Finally, the week before she runs her fitness test we have her half all of the mileage, but keep the same intensity of everything she is doing. No hard efforts for 2 days before the test to get optimum recover from any hard efforts. If Jill stuck with the program she is almost assured a new personal record in her fitness test. If Jill completes this program successfully she could take a few weeks and do easy running and then tackle a more structured, advanced program with more quality work.   # Training Intensity Table From ""Which comes first: Cardio or Weights? (Hutchinson)"" Zone | Aerobic | Threshold | Anaerobic :--|:--|:--|:-- Training Time | 70% | 20% | 10% Heart Rate | Below 80% of max | 80-90% of max | Above 90% of max Talk Test | Complete sentences | A few words at a time | Single Words Workouts | 20-60 minutes steady | Surges of 3-10 minutes | Short bursts of 0.5-3 minutes # I didn't talk about nutrition and diet Don't be afraid of carbs. You can also eat a high fat diet. Whatever sort of diet you choose, be very consistent. The goal is to ensure we have enough glycogen in our livers and in our muscles to perform optimally. This requires carbohydrates. It is highly dependent on the length of the endurance effort. Below an hour, just eat normally, and maybe have an extra bit of carbs. There are also studies that show you can eat a low carb, high fat diet for about 5-6 days and see no negative effect on your performance. However, before 5-6 days your body is getting used to a high-fat diet, and your performance will suffer.  Basically, there is a lot we don't know about the specific reasons. But, what we do know is that you should eat consistently and don't change things up much before a time trial or race. Carb loading has been studied intensely according to Dr. Noakes. So if you eat Paleo / high fat, just stick to that for at least 5 days before any endurance performance. And if you eat normal levels of carbs, just don't mess with it, in fact, you might even consider loading the carbs up a bit to top off any glycogen stores. Do I really need to tell you the rest? Eat your vegetables, lots of them. Make sure you have plenty of micro-nutrients in your diet.  # The mental game I would be remiss if I did not talk about the mental aspects of running. Running can be a very mental game. You should try to run (or even ride your bike) over as much of any course you plan to run as possible. Mental toughness takes you a long way during racing efforts. The best runners are the ones that have all the right physical traits and the mental toughness to endure suffering and are motivated to do so. # Conclusion You are still reading? We have covered the basics of how to run faster. I left out so much of the science, and I simplified a lot, so don't skewer me for this. You will still have to do your own research on training plans, but now you have enough knowledge that you should be able to build a good training plan. There are good training plan calculators out there. The key thing is to run an all out 1mi or 5K effort and ensure that your training program has you running at threshold and potentially interval pace when you are sharpening. Eat clean. Be consistent. Good luck! If you want to run faster than you have to run faster, and more often.   # EDIT: What threshold and interval workouts look like I wanted to give a quick overview of some typical threshold and interval workouts since I said they were pretty important and I answered a few questions in thread. Threshold work is also often called tempo work. You will see this as 1-2 mile repeats (or 3 miles at a slightly less intense pace). Elites will even run more miles at threshold, training for marathons (6-10 is not unheard of). Running calculators using a recent race will give you a good pace to work from here. You usually want 2-4 miles of threshold work in a threshold workout. You can do it in one or two mile repeats when you are starting out. Always warm up and cool down.  Intervals are often done at much shorter distances and you can mix and match. You want to aim for about 4-5K of distance at interval pace. So you might see, 400x12, 800x6, 1000x5, 1200x6, or (1200, 800, 1200, 800, 1200), etc. You tend to run a little faster on shorter intervals (helps improve running form to go faster) and a little slower in the longer 1K-ish, but its still all ""close"" to interval pace. After each repeat you take a rest. The longest you want to work at interval pace is about 5 minutes. According to Daniels, you can take a pretty long rest when your interval is 5 minutes in length. For shorter intervals aim for 90-120 seconds. There is a bit of a method to figuring out your ideal rest, but basically, you want to be able to finish the last rep at the same pace as the first without dying. If you can't, decrease the pace next time, but keep your rest interval the same.   # EDIT 2: Can you improve your VO2 Max?  YES! You can. /u/bananafreesince93 correctly points out that VO2 max can be increased, through training, anywhere from 10%-30%. Interval training will target your VO2 max improvement the best. I didn't mean to be too glib saying it was ""set in stone"", but of all the things you can influence through training VO2 max is one of the hardest and its quite possible to be a low responder to VO2 max training (10% doesn't move the needle very far). Lactate threshold is more sensitive to training than VO2 max, and that is what I wanted to focus on. :)  # Key Books Lore of Running (4E), Noakes Daniels' Running Formula (3E), Daniels The Science of Running: How to find your limit and train to maximize your performance, Steve Magness # Resources [Daniels' Formula Spreadsheet] (http://www.electricblues.com/archive/DanielsTables3-00-00.xls) -- This thing is sort of a monster, but if you plug in a recent race time and or time trial along with your age and weight it will give you a /lot/ of detailed information. It is quite handy. A good bit of it won't make a lot of sense without the Daniels' Formula books, but it will still be useful to see training paces, etc. Daniels' was one of the first to popularize the approach of providing a race time and then using tables to figure out training paces. Almost any training schedule type app you see will be giving you training paces very similar to what comes out of this spreadsheet. ",Im going to read this... so you better be right...,488

I change it up every time, but the important things to always grab are a lean protein (I always use chicken breast), good veggies that have a lot of fiber(Frozen, fresh, canned, whatever you feel like man.), and either brown rice or quinoa.     &nbsp;  3lbs chicken breast=2.99/lb=$8.97   One big yellow onion=$1.31   Raw nonorganic Broccoli=3.28lbs= $3.24   (yeah nonorganic... I'm cheap)   Orange peppers=4/$5= $5   One box of brown rice=1.29   Add it all up...**19.81**   7 big meals for just under 20 bucks ...not terrible when you consider it's **2.83** a pop. If you aren't in the mood for a ton of veggies you can easily omit the peppers and onions and magically you are at **1.92** per meal!   Even better! Cheaper gainz! Huzzah!     &nbsp;  Step two: Go home.    Step three: Pre-heat the oven to 350.   Step four: Start chopping. Seriously. Chop like your life depended on it. I chopped up the broccoli, the peppers, the onions, and then the chicken. Weigh your ingredients now before you cook them, it's easier and later you can just divide your totals by the amount of containers you will equally fill and you have an easy way to get your macros. Much easier than weighing each container as you scoop stuff into it. Who cares if your containers vary slightly in size? It'll average out over the next few days.  &nbsp; The rest of these steps can be done simultaneously or in whatever order you feel like. Just prioritize starting the chicken and the rice before the veggies and it should all finish about the same time.     &nbsp; Step five: Get out a baking dish, something that can fit all that chopped up chicken that you're about to cook. Line it with foil, and fill it with your chicken. Season that shit up and mix it around. I used garlic powder, salt, pepper, and some generic poultry seasoning. Use whatever you want. When your oven is done preheating, throw your chicken in the oven. Let it cook about 30 minutes. Check it every 5-10 after that, cutting into it and making sure there are no pink parts left.   Step six: Follow the directions on the boxed brown rice. It's easy.   Step seven: Grab a large pan with a lid THAT FITS(trust me, it's pretty important) and throw all your broccoli in there with 2-3 cups of water. Put it on the stove and crank it up to high. When it starts boiling turn down the heat and put the lid on it. Cook/steam the broccoli to desired texture.   Step eight: Fry up your chopped onions and peppers in medium sized pan on medium-high heat.(I didn't use any oil but you can) You can throw in garlic powder or extra seasonings if you like. I did. It's done when the onions look glassy and the peppers are soft.     &nbsp; Step nine: Woohoo! You made it! The fun part! Now that everything is cooked to perfection you can put everything into your containers. I had seven on hand so this will be seven meals for me. I like to start with the rice and layer the chicken broccoli/veggies on top. I do this so I have to eat all the veggies before getting to the ""good stuff.""    Step ten: I drizzled hot sauce and soy sauce on top of each.   Step eleven: Pack it up, put it away, wash your dishes, and go calculate your macros. Easy peasey. You are done. Congrats.

36kgy3,"Edit: This may have sounded like shit when I wrote it, but I wasn't sleeping.  I'm still not, it's 4:18am At age 25 I decided to start  working out again.  I hadn't done much lifting since college, so not much of a break at all. I did starting strength, edition II, and I followed it exactly...except for one part.  **I didn't sleep enough.** I was always tired.  I was always hungry.  I was always sore.  And I never really made the kind of gains everyone else posts about. I gained visual muscle, but I stayed at about 20% body fat.  MY PRs were nothing to write home about.  I just looked like a bigger version of my old self.  I didn't have a body transformation. I struggled for my squat.  Squat is my favorite exercise  I deep squatted 3x/week just to try and get strong.  After an entire year of missing less than 1 workout per month, I finally hit my new PR - 225 squat at full depth.  Secretly my goal had been to squat much more by this point.  In HS I was squatting 345, albeit with crappy form.    This was the moment that I had to be honest with myself - staying up until 2 or 3am every morning was limiting me.  I wasn't even drinking, I was just using the internet. There is no way around this.  There is no clever life hack.  There is no ""1 awesome secret"" that doctors hate. You need to sleep.  I don't particularly enjoy it.  I feel like I'm missing out on life if I go to sleep.  But there's no way around it. YOU WILL NOT ADVANCE PROPERLY IF YOU DO NOT SLEEP. My nutrition was good, without many cheat days. My workouts were intense, 3x/week every single week, no missed workouts, no missed sets, grinding through it.  On top of the SS workouts, on my off days, I was doing yoga, martial arts, rowing, and hiking. But the resulting strength just wasn't there.  It was sleep. It took me a year to get to the numbers that should have been achievable in 3 months.   Go to sleep.  It helps.  I wish it weren't true, but this is what I learned.

37iau1,"Two years ago, photo on the left, I was my heaviest. 162 lbs. I began running and and a little lifting. I lost 12 lbs in 5 months. Since that time I remained a steady 148lbs while increasing strength and working towards general badassery.  I ran stronglifts 5x5 for a year and moved to a Westside style template. I've competed in a power lifting comp. I can bench 135, squat 235, and dead lift 225. I'm strong. I've learned to love my body and be confident.  I began my cut at the end of March. Roughly 8 wks in and I'm down 7 lbs from when I started. Currently at 1600 cals with  P 35%/ F 35%/ C 30% break down. I follow IIFYM with mostly whole foods, and also cupcakes. Today I'm 143lbs, and in the best shape of my life. http://imgur.com/TLjppPP Edit: Ok, going to try and handle all the questions- I'm 5'4"". I hit my heaviest right before getting pregnant, and worked out a bit after giving birth.  My ""aha moment"" was that photo on the left, taken near my daughters 2nd birthday.  Though it took several months for me to take action. I was 30 then, I am 32 now. The first 12 lbs lost was not in the smartest way, 1200 calories with no regard for macros. I also trained for a 5 and 10k at this time. During maintenance/growth I ranged from 1900 to 2100 calories.  Protein usually around 130g, fat usually around 70g, and the carbs move around the most. I'm losing fat right now on the 1600, P 35%/ F 35%/ C 30% break down.  I do cardio twice a week, 15 minutes hiit  on the spin bike, and 20 minute intervals on the step mill the other day. I lift 4 days a week. Have lost 7 lbs this way in 8 weeks. Strength on cut: My max efforts just aren't there, but I'm trying to make up for it in my work sets. My bench work sets have gone up, while I am unable to hit my max.  Squat is remaining the same.  Deadlift has been shaky as I've been dealing with a few injuries recently and I'm not in a hurry to max out. I loved 5x5.  It's really so easy to follow.  You modify for girls just as Mehdi says (going up less weight for upper lifts each session).  Get that form down!  Start with the bar, go up in small increments. Advice for training fiance: the same as you.  Encourage her that lifting heavy will not make her big.  It's all based on genetics as well as body fat. Belly- belly skin: How bellies go back after kids is all based on genetics. I have a couple faint stretch marks, and if I suck in really tight, you can see loose skin just around the belly button.  I really got off easy.  Sometimes the only solution is surgery :( Thank you all for your kind comments, and for the amusing ones.",Mombod is way better than dadbod,804
37ylk5,"To start, a motivational quote: >Errybody wanna be a bodybuilder, but nobody wanna lift this heavy-ass weight. R. Coleman. Anyway, there seems to be a bit of a conflict between conventional training wisdom for beginners (3 day a week full body linear progression! SS/SL/Greyskull only!) and what beginners actually wanna do (in the gym every day, biceps and triceps, woo!). What I'm going to write here is an attempt to reconcile these two ideas and produce a sane way for a beginner to train more frequently and give the attention to the glamour muscles that they want, while also progressing in a correct, appropriate manner. To do this, I'm going to borrow wisdom from a few different programs and ideas. My goal is to provide an accessible program for beginners with enough volume to stimulate growth in the bro muscles, while also giving enough intensity in the main movements to elicit strength adaptations.  **First, some nomenclature:** 3x10 - in this case, it reads *three sets of ten repetitions* 2x5, 1x5+  - this reads as, *two sets of 5, one set of at least 5, but as many as possible* (more to come on this later)  SS - this reads as *superset* (two exercises performed back to back with no rest in between. **SUPASET**) BB - *barbell* DB - *dumbbell* **WOAH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ACCESSORY WORK AND MAIN LIFTS?** The main lifts are just the first exercises of the day, and these are always going to be done heavier than the other lifts of that day. The lifts that follow are accessory lifts, designed to build muscle, balance out weakpoints and improve your strength in the main lifts. **BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT STRENGTH, I JUST WANNA BE JACKED AND TAN** Who doesn't wanna be jacked and tan, I mean honestly? But strength progression is important, especially as a novice, for making you more muscular. Generally speaking, the more you can lift, the bigger you'll be. Progressing your main lifts will also have carryover effects to your other lifts as well: if you can bench press 300lbs, you can sure as hell bet that you're not gonna be incline dumbbell pressing 20lbs. And who do you really think is gonna be bigger: the version of you who can bench 200lbs, or the version of you who can bench 300lbs? **WHAT IS LINEAR PROGRESSION?** Put simply, linear progression means that if you were to graph your weights, the line that you would end up drawing would be straight. [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/yX67l03.png). This means that you need to add weight workout to workout, every workout. You can make progress very quickly this way *if you're a beginner* because your body doesn't need much stimulus to adapt. As you get more advanced, you need more stimulus and more time to adapt. [See this handy graph from Starting Strength to get a better understanding of what I mean.](http://startingstrength.com/articles/figure1te.jpg) **WHAT IS PPL?** PPL is just the initialiasm of *push, pull, legs* or *pull, push, legs* (it really doesn't matter which). This will (typically) have you doing 3 workouts, 2 times per week.  * **Push** - this can just be thought of as moving things *away* from your body (think of a bench press) * **Pull** - this can be thought of as moving things *towards* your body (think of a row) * **Legs** - I'm not going to bother with an explanation here **WHY DO I NEED TO PROGRESS LIKE THIS?** [Because of progressive overload](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload). Without this, you won't make any adaptations (strength gains or size gains). You will always start the day with a heavy barbell exercise, and this is what you need to progress linearly (if you remember from above, this means add weight every session). Then afterwards you will follow up with higher repetition exercises, that are more 'bodybuilding' based.  **WHAT IS THE PROGRAM?** It's 6 days a week. You can run it one of two ways: **PPLRPPL** or **PPLPPLR** (where R denotes a rest day) depending on your schedule and preferences: it really makes no difference. Personally, I would run the program in the Pull, Push, Legs order. **YOU SAY TO ADD WEIGHT LINEARLY, BUT HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO YOU ADD PER SESSION?** * 2.5kg/5lbs for upper body lifts (bench press, row, overhead press) * 2.5kg/5lbs for squats * 5kg/10lbs for deadlifts Now, without further ado... **PULL** Deadlifts 1x5+/Barbell rows 4x5, 1x5+ (alternate, so if you did deadlifts on Monday, you would do rows on Thursday, and so on) 3x8-12 Pulldowns OR Pullups OR chinups 3x8-12 seated cable rows OR chest supported rows 5x15-20 face pulls 4x8-12 hammer curls 4x8-12 dumbbell curls **PUSH**  4x5, 1x5+ bench press/4x5, 1x5+ overhead press (alternate in the same fashion as the rows and deadlifts) 3x8-12 overhead press/3x8-12 bench press (do the opposite movement: if you bench pressed first, overhead press here) 3x8-12 incline dumbbell press 3x8-12 triceps pushdowns SS 3x15-20 lateral raises 3x8-12 overhead triceps extensions SS 3x15-20 lateral raises **LEGS** 2x5, 1x5+ squat 3x8-12 Romanian Deadlift 3x8-12 leg press 3x8-12 leg curls 5x8-12 calf raises   **FINER DETAILS: AMRAP SETS AND PROGRESSION OF ACCESSORIES** So, the first movements are done for sets of 5, and the final set is what's known as an *AMRAP* set (As Many Reps As Possible). This doesn't mean that you can just YOLO it and push until you can't push anymore. By As Many Reps As Possible, it really means *As many reps as possible while still maintaining good form*. You don't really want to be grinding too many reps, since you want to keep rep quality high. If you want a good reason to keep rep quality high, [watch this recent video from Omar Isuf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLSpdzT6sGw). The point of the AMRAP set is that it really gives you a chance to test your limits, and if you're feeling good on a specific day, you can get in a couple of extra reps. But the real moneymaker from this comes in when you deload. **Progression of accessories** should be done as so: when you can hit 3 sets of 12 with good form, add weight. As long as you're in the 8-12 range for your sets then you're good. If not, lower the weight. **HOW DO I KNOW WHAT WEIGHTS TO START WITH?** I don't like the Stronglifts 5x5 idea of starting with the empty bar, because I think the empty bar is useless for training purposes if you're capable of lifting a lot more. The mechanics of a lift (especially the squat for me) change a lot with weight.  I would recommend starting with the bar, and gradually adding weight for sets of 5 until the bar slows down. Then back off 2.5kg/5lbs, and this is your starting point. So if you worked up to a 60kg bench press before the bar slowed down at all, start at 57.5kg.   **WARMUPS** (idea courtesy of /u/Gawd1) I'm a big believer in just practising the movement as a warmup. So you can use bench press to warm up for bench press. Or squats to warm up for squats. You get the idea. The goal of a warmup is to get blood into the muscles and joints that are going to be used, and also to start drilling the motor patterns into your body for form purposes. As an example, if you're going to be benching 200lbs as your top set for that day, your warmups could look something like this: Empty bar x 10 95lbs x10 135lbs x5 185lbs x3 200lbs 4x5, 1x5+ Warming up is a very individual thing, however, so do whatever you want to get yourself prepared for the lifts. If you like foam rolling, great. If you like some dynamic stretches and things like clapping pushups, great. Do whatever you want to do. The only recommendation is that I would avoid static stretches before lifting.  **REST** Rest as long as is needed between sets. For a general guideline, I would recommend: * 3-5 minutes between your first exercise of the day * 1-3 minutes between all your other exercises Don't worry too much about rest times, and worry more about just getting all your sets and reps in. **FAILURE** Failure is part of life, and since lifting weights is a lot like life, failure is also part of lifting weights. At some point, you're going to fail. Failure can occur really for two reasons * not enough sleep, food or recovery: if you spent all night partying and chasing pussy with your wing man, Jim Beam, you're probably not gonna perform well in the gym. In this case, don't count it as a true failure and just try again next time when you're fresh * strength failure. This is when you've reached the limit of your progression. If you fail a session 3 times in a row (for example, if you fail to hit 3x5 on squats at 100kg 3 times in a row), you need to lower the weight. This leads us to... **DELOADING** Deloading is exactly what it sounds like -- taking weight off the bar. Take 10% off your working weights (so a 100kg squat would go back down to 90kg), and work back up. This should give you a good chance to push things on the AMRAP final sets. If you got 2x5 and 1x6 at 90kg the first time round, you can bet your ass that you'll get more than 6 on your last set the second time round. And by the time you work your way back up, if you can hit 97.5kg for 2x5, 1x8, 100kg for 3x5 will be trivial.  **MY GYM OR GARAGE DOESN'T HAVE XYZ, WHAT CAN I DO INSTEAD?** (this section as recommended by /u/LaRivalita) So basically everything here is interchangeable, except the main lifts: the squat, bench press, deadlift, overhead press, bent over row. If you can do those in your gym (not in a smith machine) then you can make this program work. Treat it more as template than gospel. Some ideas for substitutions are the following (and if anyone has other suggestions, I'm happy to add them to the list!): * **Pull substitutions** * Seated cable rows can be replaced with dumbbell rows or t-bar rows * Face pulls can be replaced with rear delt flyes AND band pull aparts (not one or the other) * hammer curls and dumbbell curls can really be replaced by any curl variation: it's a curl, shit ain't that serious! * **Push substitutions** * incline dumbbell press can be replaced with landmine press * triceps pushdowns and overhead extensions can be replaced with any general triceps exercise: skullcrushers, lying triceps extensions, dumbbell triceps extensions, whatever you want to do * **Legs substitutions** * Leg press can be substituted with front squats  * leg curls can be substituted with glute ham raises * calf raises can be substituted by nothing because who gives a flying fuck about calves anyway? (not srs, any kind of calf raise will be fine here) **HOW TO MODIFY THIS TO FIT YOUR GOALS** (this section as recommended by /u/theedoor) **If you want to lift heavy weights** There are a few things I would recommend here.  /u/theedoor's advice of: ""for example, if you want to be focused a bit more on strength, replace 3x8-12 RDLs with 3x5 RDLs. Add weighted dips, and weighted chins-ups/pull-ups in the 3x5 range (with bodyweight back off sets)."" is brilliant. If you want to lift heavy weights, then you need to lift heavy weights. I know this sounds stupid, but it makes sense. The more time you spend in the lower rep ranges, the better you're going to be in those rep ranges, so if you want to lift heavy weights then feel free to alter the compound movement accessories (so your presses, your pulldowns or rows, your romanian deadlifts or your leg presses) to be in the lower rep ranges. 3x4-6 is perfect for things like this. In my view, the isolation accessory movements should be kept in higher rep ranges, because joint wear and tear can creep in here, and getting a pump is fucking awesome. Specificity is also pretty key if you want to lift heavy weights. If you want to be a good bench presser, then maybe incline dumbbell press isn't going to be *as specific* as doing a close grip bench press instead is. If you want to substitute some of the (again, compound) accessory movements for ones that more closely resemble the main lifts, then be my guest.  **If you want to increase endurance** Keep the first exercise the same, up the rep range on everything else. 15-20 reps is a great range for increasing endurance. **If you just want to be jacked and tan** Keep things the way they are. There's enough volume and a decent enough mix of volume and strength to get you big as long as you're eating enough. If you feel a specific bodypart is lacking, throw in a couple of extra sets for it, ideally isolation (so think along the lines of pec deck or biceps curls, not bench press or rows), so that you're not adding too much systemic stress, which could affect recovery times. **WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT, FORM OR WEIGHT?** (idea courtesy of /u/Nobody773) Both. Nobody got big benching 1 plate regardless of how good their form is. You should push the weights up and continue progressing as long as your form is *acceptable.* Demanding that your form is 100% perfect all the time as a beginner is just not possible, so as long as your form is acceptable and not injurious, then continue adding weight. As an unknown lifter once said: the best way to improve your form at 225lbs is to make 225lbs part of your warmup. I can guarantee that when you're squatting 315lbs for reps that your form at 225lbs is picture perfect. **THIS IS COMPLICATED, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON! HOW DO I KEEP TRACK OF THIS?** It's something I hadn't thought of, since I have a borderline-autistic savant memory for things I do in the gym, but [here is spreadsheet created by /u/Mobius000](https://drive.google.com/previewtemplate?id=1MbOWpTBcNNQuqHd8q9jUUR2V-ZERWNDKYPd5kzVjCJQ&mode=public) which will make tracking this a walk in the park.  **CAN I DO THIS PROGRAM WHILE CUTTING?** Sure! You can do anything while cutting, so try it out. I suspect that recovery may become an issue due to the volume, so if you are struggling to recover and feeling like shit, drop some of the volume: 3x8-12 becomes 2x8-12, for example. Taper the volume off as little as possible, and keep the volume for the main lifts as high as you can for as long as you can. **CAN I DO AB WORK ON THIS PROGRAM?** Yes. I would recommend doing ab work on your deadlift days and your squat days if you want to do ab work. Nothing major, just do a few sets of (weighted) planks or a few sets of ab wheel and some hanging leg raises. **NEXT STEPS** A few people have requested this, so I thought I would write out what I think logical next steps from here are. This is a **beginner** routine, for beginners. Intermediate and advanced lifters can't make linear progress like this anymore, and require some more advanced training in order to progress.   Questions courtesy of /u/FattestRabbit: >**What are some signs that you may want to graduate from this program?** Put simply, when you're no longer a beginner. A beginner lifter is defined as someone who can make progress workout to workout: if you deadlift 100kg for 5 reps, then the next time you deadlift you'll be able to deadlift 105kg for 5 reps. Once this *linear* progression stalls out, and you take longer to recover between workouts because the weights are heavier (and therefore the systemic stress is higher), you become an intermediate lifter. An intermediate lifter is someone who needs ~weekly progression in order to maintain progress (programs like the Texas Method for example). >**Can you adapt this program for 'intermediate' lifters? How far can this program take you if you upped the weights and moved more sets to 3x5-8 (instead of 3x8-12)?** Yes, you can adapt this program for more intermediate lifters, but I wouldn't like to try and formalise something like that. The more advanced you get as a lifter, the more you should be realising what things are beneficial for you, and figuring out what works for you, because everyone is a bit different. In the beginner stages, this stuff really isn't too important because almost any beginner will make progress doing almost anything. I would recommend looking at progression schemes that are in things like the **Texas Method**, **Madcows 5x5** and **5/3/1** for your main lifts and then just sticking with fairly similar accessory work: more volume almost always equates to better gains, provided you can recover from it. Moving more sets to 3x5-8 wouldn't necessarily have a huge impact on your abilities to lift big weights in the main lifts, and heavier sets (in my experience) tend to impose more wear and tear on the joints. If you're an intermediate lifter then go for it, try it out, it may work for you. Intermediate lifting should be all about trying things for yourself and getting to know yourself better as a lifter. >**What are some next logical programs to try after this one?** Texas Method, Madcows 5x5, 5/3/1, PHAT, PHUL, /u/gzcl's Jacked and Tan - any program designed towards intermediates that are in line with your goals. Pick something you think you'll have fun with: unless this shit is your job or you really want to compete seriously then just have fun in the gym and don't do something too retarded, and you'll probably stick to it better than something you hate, and go to the gym with more drive and intensity. I'm a big believer that consistent effort is probably the most important thing you can make sure of. [PowerliftingToWin](http://www.powerliftingtowin.com/) is a great resource for training information and programming information, so I would recommend reading a bunch there. **CAN I DO THIS ROUTINE ONLY ONCE PER WEEK?** You *could.* And that's all I'm gonna say. I wouldn't recommend it, because that'd put frequency of all the lifts at only once per week. If you can only run it once per week then I would recommend something like Greyskull LP, Stronglifts 5x5 or Starting Strength instead for increased frequency.",This is amazing will you be my boyfriend?,190
38dyy5,"I wanted to post a 12 month progress, but had my gall bladder removed in April, so I was kind of set back a month.  So here is my very short and quick 13 month progress. [Pics](http://imgur.com/a/fQ2Al) 33 Male.  6'0"".  280 lbs ->  168 lbs At my highest point, I was 280 lbs.  I lost a few pounds just by not eating as much junk, but not really tracking anything.  Then in April of last year I got more serious with dieting and working out.   Diet was pretty much a straight IIFYM diet.  Tracked with MyFitnessPal.  Started at about 1,000 calroie deficit initially, then decreased the deficit to about 500-750 towards the end.  Watched calories and I tried to get protein to about 160-180 grams, then after that, didn't worry too much about Carbs and Fats.   Workout was pretty much all weight lifting with no cardio outside of regular daily type stuff (playing with kids, occasional bike ride or walk with dog, house/yard work, weekly softball game).  I started out with a PHUL routine, but ended up switching to a [P/P/L routine](http://imgur.com/a/rRCnz).  Would go about 3-5 days a week, depending on schedule.  Married with 2 kids, so couldn't always just set specific days and times for the gym.  It was just go when I could kind of thing.  I never once tried for max lifts.  Would just add/reduce weight depending on how my last workout was.  Actually had several times of negative progress, most likely because of being on a pretty decent deficit.  Now that I'm down, and will be going into a maintenance, and eventually a bulk, I will be doing more with actually tracking the progress of my lifts.   Do have a fair amount of loose skin in my chest, stomach and legs.  The legs are actually the worst area.  Have a lot of loose skin hanging around my thighs/butt area.  You can see some in the chest, I don’t like it, but it’s not as bad as it could have been.  My stomach you can’t see the worst of it as my shorts hide it pretty well.  But it’s definitely there, especially on the lower abs.    That ab shot in the bathroom is in part due to some ‘generous’ lighting.   EDIT:   Too hard to go through and reply to every comment, so thank you so much for the compliments and encouragement!  I was honestly still very self-conscious about my body and this has made me feel really good!  **EDIT 2:**  Some replies to some questions I've gotten asked several times: -The app for the workout routine is JeFit (should be getting some royalties or something for the amount of times I've recommended them now.) -The Skin:  For right now, I'm not really doing anything about the loose skin.  It's still too early.  I will have to give my skin some time to see how much it might rebound naturally.  In the mean time, I'm going to work on adding some lean muscle to fill in the space.  I don't know if it's bad enough to justify the cost of surgery down the road.  It wouldn't be covered by my insurance, and I don't have that kind of cash lying around.   -My routine.  Yeah, it's a lot of volume.  And I don't do a set progression or anything.  Basically, I have a range of target reps, usually 5-7 for ""Big"" excercises, and then 8-12 for accessory types.  I will basically go to failure, or just short of failure, on every set of every exercise.  If it's too easy, I go up in weight.  If I don't make my target range, I go back down.   Sometimes it ends up looking like a reverse pyramid type of program.  I received a lot of other questions.  I could post a follow-up thread in a week or so with more answers to people with questions if anyone would be interested in that.  Also maybe post a few more pics.  Espeically of the loose skin since a lot of people want to know about that. Reply or message me if that would actually interest anyone. I didn't think that people would be so interested or even impressed with this.  But I definitely would love to help anyone possible.  So bring it on.  ","I love the simplicity of it all.  1000 Calorie deficit, meet adequate protein, and the rest is fair game.  Workout 3-5 days a week, but flexible.  It just goes to show that you don't need crazy supplements, or only eating carbs at certain points in the day, or trying to load massive amounts of protein after a workout, or doing keto or some crazy fad diet.  You just stuck to the most important, proven elements (calorie deficit, moderate protein, consistency, progressive overload) and got fantastic results!  Good for you!",1028
38mndj,I thought I would share due to the recent question of “What is the reason you work out?” I saw a lot of posts about physical attraction but little to none about mental satisfaction. I am depressed all the time and rarely happy but working out seems to be the only thing that makes me happy anymore and the only thing that actually brings me joy and at some points makes me feel like it is the only reason I want to live. My dream to better my life started here and this subreddit might be the only thing keeping it going. I was just curious if anyone else felt the same way I did? Edit: it's amazing to see all the responses on here. I figured I was not in the same boat but it definitely helps to get it off my chest and hear it from others. I hope we all have crazy gains in the future along with happiness.  Edit 2: I don't know how to comment on my own post so I'm going to just keep doing edits but just wanted to say I appreciate all the love around here. Fitness truly does bring people together. I hope you guys all continue to workout and improve yourselves I know I will.  Edit 3: At the gym right now doing squats in honor of all you beautiful people.  Edit 4: I thought I would do one final edit to go ahead and say I know how difficult it can be to workout alone and sometimes you need an extra push. To thank you for all the wonderful responses I want to at least offer to workout with you guys! I live in Orange County in Southern California if anyone ever wants to work out feel free to pm me. It's the least I can do and offer. Thank you again for all the support. ,Same bro. Love of my life died almost 4 years ago. Spent a year absolutely shattered. Decided to actually do something to stop being so depressed. 2 years ago I joined the gym.  I wouldn't say it makes me happy. But it makes me forget. It makes me feel normal. ,1094
392bpc,"This accident just happened 2 days ago and I've yet to see him in person since he lives out of state, but when I talked to him today on the phone, one of the first things he mentioned was how bummed he was that his progress was gonna slow down.  He has an unbelievably positive attitude and tasked me with finding ways he can keep going in the gym.  I know it will be awhile before he's back in the gym and he will probably be fitted with prosthetics at some point, but for now I'm just looking for articles or videos or simple workout ideas to give him something to look forward to; Something I can show him when I see him later this week that will keep his spirits up after the morphine stops coming.  If it helps, his left hand is completely gone and his right has 2 fingers remaining, although I'm not sure which ones they are. Thanks in advance for any and all help! EDIT: I can't thank everyone enough for the positive thoughts/messages, the helpful videos, advice on lifts and options, and of course the masturbation jokes.  I want to especially thank /u/cameronwevolver and the people behind him at Wevolver who are dedicating one of their 3D printers for a new hand for my brother.  I plan on making a follow-up post once he's back in the gym and without a doubt hitting it harder than ever. I plan on showing him this whole thread when I see him tomorrow and I'm so grateful that he will have so much positive affirmation to take root in if he's ever feeling down.  Here's him with his 3 month old daughter: http://imgur.com/PC9psO7 , who I'm sure will be grateful to you guys as well, once she's old enough to have that emotion.","Number one: your brother needs to get a lawyer.  I don't care if he has worked for this company for his entire (adult) life and he feels he owes them something.  They can't reattach his hands. I have worked for a major oil company (although in the office and not in the field).  Just the chance that I *might* go to the field was enough for the company to register me in mandatory training in explosives awareness and radiation awareness (two things commonly found on oil rigs).  This tells me that they are *petrified* of a systemic management failure that would allow someone to get seriously injured.  This attitude is so pervasive in the industry (at least at the office level) that nobody uses the word ""accident.""  An injury is the result of a ""safety incident,"" which should be preventable (hence not an ""accident"").   What I'm saying is that either your brother has been injured due to: - negligent management practices, which should get him well looked after and also trigger a proper training program to prevent lots of other unfortunate employees from losing their hands (or worse) - a negligent supervisor, who needs to get fired before he makes **someone else** lose their hands - his own negligence, which is still tragic.  But hopefully he can receive insurance payments to help. If your brother isn't looking for a lawyer for *his own* good, he should be doing it to look out for the other guy - his colleagues who work at the same place.   He needs to see someone now.  There are steps he needs to take soon that will strengthen his case.  I'm not a lawyer, but I have a friend who is.  His wife was hit from behind in a car collision.  Her husband (the lawyer) made her keep a ""pain journal.""  This was documentation they could later use to show that she *was* hurt, and how badly, over time.  This is just an example.  I don't know what the right steps are for someone who has lost their hands, but it illustrates that proper guidance can be helpful. I earned a good living from the oil industry, so it pains me to hear that your brother has been permanently injured from work in this sector.",4337

Every sane person knows that hating people doesn't help them, encouragement and education does.  As a former fat person myself I suppose I have a different perspective to some other 'fit' people but let's all remember to help people improve (if that's what they are trying to do) and not ridicule them.   And if you are a fat person reading this post who is wondering what the other people in the gym are thinking about you, it is not all this bollocks being posted on this site.

3apxg1,"Some of you might remember a couple of weeks back when I offered to build /u/DrSpaceMann a [HACKberry](https://www.wevolver.com/hiroshi.yamaura/exiii-hackberry) for his brother in /r/fitness [""Older brother just lost his hands in an oil rig accident...""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/392bpc/older_brother_just_lost_his_hands_in_an_oil_rig/) Well, I'm actually doing it. And here is how it's going so far... Since posting the reply, I’ve been receiving emails from all over the world with people asking for help building the HACKberry for their own friends and family. Realising I'm one guy with limited resources who can't possibly build a HACKberry for everyone, I've been in touch with [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) (home to several of the world’s top supercomputers and the world’s largest 3D printer) to see if they can print HACKberry’s for as many of the amputees who have contacted me as possible, including [Rosa Moreno](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/11/lost-hands-making-flatscreens-no-help) who lost both her arms in a manufacturing accident and was only awarded a $14,400 settlement and can't afford the prosthesis she needs to get back to work. It was an awesome Redditor named Michael who emailed me to put me in touch with Rosa. Also, just to give you a bit more background, Oak Ridge 3D printed a [Shelby Cobra](http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/videos/a25659/watch-the-government-3d-print-a-shelby-cobra-replica/) for the Detroit Auto Show in 2014, so the HACKberry should be a piece of cake.  After a brief email exchange, my contact at the lab (who is a great guy and also a Redditor) has requested a Skype call with me tomorrow to discuss the project further.  Oak Ridge has also recently launched a summer internship program, so the plan is to task a team of interns with performing structural tests on 3D printed HACKberry components in various exotic materials as a part of their education. This way we'll be able to check the performance of everything from aluminum to carbon fiber. The plan is then to provide /u/DrSpaceMann's brother with a prosthesis built from the material that proves to be the most effective. I have also been contacted by a wonderful hand surgeon from Melbourne, Australia who is acting as a medical consultant for the project. Make wrote a little [article](http://makezine.com/2015/06/16/open-source-prosthetic-hands-focus-function-personality/) which was cool too. I will post again tomorrow to let everyone know how the meeting with Oak Ridge goes.","This makes me very happy. What a time we live in, where you can have a terrible, life-altering injury and also such viable options that make it not so life-altering. So glad that the circumstances were there for you to help this man and others. Is there a timeline for the brother's HACKberry? Also, that fucking cobra is printed? Holy shit, what year is it?",466
3awmhc,"Before/After: http://imgur.com/IWObRej http://imgur.com/wFjR607  Background information I played sports my entire life up until high school ended. I went off to college, drank a bit and dropped out after one semester. I found myself sitting at home every day, addicted to World of Warcraft. I religiously played (For the Horde!) every day. And by every day, I mean I started playing when I first woke up and didn’t stop until I felt like going to bed. I craved competition and since I wasn’t getting it from sports anymore, I turned to WoW (PvP and progressive raiding). I continued this lifestyle until I got up to 200 lbs. (I’m 5’7 btw and couldn’t get over 160 in high school). It was hard to look at myself in the mirror anymore so I decided to join a gym.   I went around and did all the machines and left. I had no idea what I was doing but I kept doing it. I was unhappy with the results so I started researching and reading about fitness. I found it to be fascinating. I was learning so much about training but neglected the diet side (bad idea). I was getting stronger but wasn’t getting the body I wanted. I kept trying to meal prep and kept failing miserably. I still can’t hardly eat chicken and rice because I was trying to revolve my life around it back then. I would never stick to it. Eventually I discovered IIFYM and it completely changed everything. Using MyFitnessPal made it a breeze and I started seeing results. I loved learning about it so I ended up going back to school and getting my degree in Exercise Science. I kept studying and kept lifting. I never followed any specific routines such as 5x5. I would watch a video on YouTube and try their workouts.  I’m currently doing a BB/Powerlifting split I just put together: Monday – Heavy Push Tuesday – Light Pull Wednesday – Heavy Legs Thursday – Light Push Friday – Heavy Pull Saturday – Light Legs Sunday – Optional Arms **Light means bodybuilding rep schemes, not necessarily light weight. I’ve always done a ton of volume so it’s never bothered me.  My friend recently did a powerlifting meet and asked if I would do the next one with her so that’s why I started doing this. Does anyone have any advice on powerlifting, I’m definitely new to it. Any advice on a routine would be appreciated.   I’ve waited so long to post my transformation because I’m always blown away by everyone else’s that I see so I always talk myself out of it. My goal is to help inspire people, even if it’s just one guy or gal. I’m trying to start a brand that will eventually start making fitness t shirts and apparel. I already have some designs that I think people would like. I’ll keep anyone posted that is interested! Thanks for viewing!  ***************************************************************************************** WOW! (lol...) I didn't think this post would get big at all. I love all of my fellow gaming nerds. I'm inspired to hear so many of you on your fitness journey or ready to start. I'd like to see all of you continue to progress. You can follow me on Instagram (@otsathletics) and I'll follow you back. Nothing but fantastic support from everyone. Fitness is about lifting people up, not tearing them down. ***************************************************************************************** Second WOW! I had no idea so many people could relate to my journey. I've never felt this much positivity in my life. I feel like I had 1000 people hug me at once!

I'll post my story when I finish up this cut along with a new ""after"" pic in about a month or two (the current after pic was from last summer, I've added some size since then).

3b51gz,"I went to go see my doctor recently and she told me this.  (She is specifically a Sports Medicine M.D., by the way.)  She said the leg extension machine puts so much unnatural torque on the knee joint, it has a high probability of leading to long-term knee problems.  She said pretty much every other standard leg exercise is fine.  If I want to work quads, I should work them with squats or leg press. Then the next, separate sports doctor I saw (specifically a rehab specialist) said the same thing to me without me asking or prompting.  Not just for my knee injury, but in general you shouldn't use that machine. I'd never heard that before, except from these two professionals.

3bjf0l,"**EDIT: I AM FEMALE (sorry, forgot to put that in there)** Hey reddit! About a year ago, I made a post of me deadlifting 315lbs @121lb bodyweight. I made the post because I was proud I finally hit 3 plates, only to have you inform me that I could set the Junior American record with the USPA! I competed later that summer and ended up setting the American record in the 123.5lb class for 18-19yr olds in all 3 lifts and total.  After that I thought I was done with powerlifting, I took the following Fall semester off of lifting and restarted in the winter. My school started up a Powerlifting club that Spring and that peaked my interest again. I lifted with the club and at the school meet I pulled 170kg/375lbs. I looked into the USAPL this time since that's a tested, drug free federation (I am a drug-free lifter), and found that I could hold the American Open deadlift record (currently 165kg/363.75lbs) and also the World Junior IPF deadlift record (currently unattained, but requires at least 170kg to have record). In order to set these records I need to perform the lift at National and IPF(international) level meets.  I competed at a local meet on Saturday in order to qualify me for Raw Nationals, which will than qualify me for the Arnold Sport (international IPF meet). I weighed in at 56.2kg/123.5 lbs. My final deadlift attempt was 375 lbs and it came up smoother than ever!   **[DEADLIFT VIDEO, 375lbs at 123.5lbs bodyweight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-qYXoSNcH4&t=0m6s)**  I never would have thought of competing if it weren't for Reddit, and now I am on my way to setting a world record!!

3bncdw,"Here is the before and after pic. http://imgur.com/WtN6gFv I had always exercised and lifted weights regularly since starting college in 2009. In late November of 2012, I injured myself and had to use crutches for about a month. I wasn't able to jog for 6 months and I began letting myself go when it came to proper dieting. I would eat fast food and drink beer regularly which ultimately led to me getting to my heaviest weight of about 210 lbs. Around mid-December of 2014 I decided it was time to take control and finally begin losing all of my excess fat. I started at around 203 lbs with 33% bodyfat. Since I had lifted weights for years, I had a decent amount of muscle and strength so I tried to be very careful to not lose any of it. I lifted weights about 5 times a week, sometimes 6. I also incorporated cardio and HIIT once or twice a week. What really helped me lose fat was portion control; I began eating only until I was satisfied, which was very difficult. My goal is to reach 10% bodyfat and then begin bulking back to about 180 lbs, but lean of course.  During my 50+ lbs of cutting, I've been able to maintain close to 100% of my strength as well as running a 6 minute mile. I always heavily preferred weightlifting over running/cardio, but I knew that doing both together would be really effective in terms of fat loss. At first, I would add HIIT with the stationary bike, which I did for about a month. Then I did suicides after my workout twice a week, plus a 3 mile run once a week for about 2 months total. Eventually, I got rid of the suicides and 3 mile run and began trying to run a mile on the treadmill as fast as possible, which I would do after weightlifting. I started off around 8+ minutes and was able to run a 6 minute mile after about 2 months. During this 6th and most recent month, I have begun trying to run a mile as fast as I can first thing in the morning. I think changing my routine was an important factor in my fat loss, and I recommend it to anyone out there. This journey has really changed my outlook on fitness and health and because of that I am pursuing my personal trainer certification. Engineering is my primary profession but motivating and helping others achieve their fitness goals has become a new passion for me. Several of my friends and family have been inspired by my results and have sought out my advice, and I hope this post inspires even more people. I have a fitness blog that I frequently update with workouts, meals, and nutrition advice so that people who are busy can find ways to incorporate fitness and proper dieting into their life. If anyone is interested in viewing it, please message me. I would also love to answer any questions regarding my transformation and regarding fitness, nutrition, and weightlifting in general.

Edit: For people asking about my ab exercises, here are some of the exercises I would do before I began cutting, I would try to add resistance to all of them by holding a weight slightly behind my head: http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/cross-body-crunch http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/decline-crunch http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/decline-reverse-crunch http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/elbow-to-knee http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/air-bike http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/exercise-ball-pull-in http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/dumbbell-side-bend","To everyone who is attacking my diet and the fact that I chose not to include sugars in my macros: I didn't come up with the diet plan first, and then follow it. I ate the meals, and THEN recorded the nutritional facts so that I can share it with others. I never had a target calorie goal, or target macro goal. The only reason I didn't include sugars when documenting my meals is because I don't think they are as important as complex carbs. I've done my share of research on nutrition, so I have a good idea of how much to eat of what foods. It was only after making the list above that I learned how many grams of fat, carbs, and protein I was actually consuming. Regardless, I prefer to be pragmatic when it comes to fitness, instead of classifying **this** as broscience or **that** as an absolute fact",1647
3btyzo,"My wife and I decided around the beginning of the year to convert our garage into a [home gym](http://imgur.com/a/lrFPS). At first we were only going to make one side of the garage a gym but later decided to do the whole garage so we could have all of the equipment that we wanted. &nbsp; We got sick of the Gold's Gym near our house. Having to wait for equipment is annoying and having to take time out of our day to drive there was inconvenient. We had done P90x and Insanity in our home so we had a few pieces of equipment from that but mainly bought everything this year. I found a couple things on craigslist/KSL but the majority of things I bought new. I wanted my gym to look good and be nice and I didn't want to compromise my ultimate vision very much.  &nbsp; The process started out with switching a single bulb fixture to two 4 bulb fluorescent lights. During the project I learned a little about electrical, sheetrock, taping, painting, and epoxying. It took about 4 months to finish prepping the garage for the equipment. Once I placed my order it came in about 6 weeks. &nbsp; Equipment: &nbsp; - BFS Full Cage with Landmine attachment, Dip attachment, and Swivel Pullup Grips. - BFS Leg Press/Hack Squat Machine - BFS Leg Extension/Leg Curl Machine - BFS Lat Pulldown/Row Machine - BFS Seated Calf Machine - BFS D1 Flat to Incline Bench - 2 Dumbbell Racks - 5-115 Pound Dumbbell Set - Cap ob-86b Barbell - 15 lb Curl Bar - 5' 30 lb Barbell - 635 lbs of Olympic weights - Body Solid GDCC200 Functional Trainer - Rogue Dip Belt - Valeo Weight Belt - 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, & 20 lb Cap Workout bars",What was the total cost of all the equipment? Was looking into doing something like that myself. Very nice job and I like the way those colors turned out!,467

3chqy8,"http://imgur.com/a/1ELjR So about 2 and half to 3 years ago I weighed about 366lbs. It sucked. I had been fat my entire life and always wanted to change it. I wanted to change because for one its unhealthy to be that size. I had zero confidence. I wanted to be in the military and one day be a police officer or firefighter/paramedic but I wasn't going to get there being fat. There are plenty of reasons I can rattle off for my obesity but it all comes down to laziness and ignorance to nutrition. So 2.5 years ago my uncle got me into lifting (forcefully lol). We'd lift almost everyday after I got up around 3pm (I worked 3rd shift). We'd lift for a few hours and before I knew it I had to get ready for work soon. So I had only a small window of time to eat and chill out versus waking up and eating/chilling all day then going to work. A month went by and I finally weighed myself. I lost 6 pounds and figured to myself that I might as well keep this up... and that's what happened. I found out about calorie counting which made my progress even better and taught me how to eat (I honestly had zero clue about the whole energy in vs energy out stuff). Then I found reddit and r/fitness and took in lots of info from here and just applied all the basics from the FAQ + other things, 2.5 years go by and boom! I'm fit enough to go to recruit training so I do, and I accomplish a huge goal!  Thats all I can think to write right now so feel free to ask questions! edit: I'm 5'11 btw, forgot to put it in the title.","Outstanding job, boot.",2379

3cpbrm,"Last night, needing my fix after not being able to get enough food in me I decided I should have a protein shake before bed.  So I get my trusty custom blend protein powder out. This is a 5lb container mixed of about 5 different half bags from various manufactures that I combined when I was moving to save space. Flavors range from vanilla and chocolate whey iso to cookies and cream casein. Low and behold I have no milk. This mix with water is not something I want to try again so hmm... what can I mix it with. No yogurt, no juice, no ice cream GOT IT! cottage cheese is all I have. Why not, what could go wrong? So I mix about 2/3 scoop into the cottage cheese and it turns into a grey dough ball lump with white chunks in it. The taste is off the charts foul. I am chewing this mix like last weeks congealed oatmeal with the benefit of the moist cottage cheese curds that almost pop in my mouth, when I decide it needs a little texture to help. I mix in a small handful of granola. This does not make it any better. Now its a grey goo with crunchy bits and the curds still explode as I bite into them. All I could think about is bugs and critters getting chewed up for the sake of gainz.  1/10 will drink with water next time.  TLDR: amalgamate of random flavor and types of protein, cottage cheese and granola. Its like old oatmeal with bugs.   Edit: mandatory holy fuck this blew up while at work. RIP inbox. Btw, some of you are seriously wrong in the head for what you have done.",On a number of occasions I've forgotten my blender bottle but still have the protein dispenser. So I will fill mouth with water then scoop protein in mouth and gargle for a mouth shake several times. Not tasty. ,1782
3dzcab,"Hello, I was obese for most of my life and morbidly obese for most of my adulthood.  My highest recorded weight was 325 lbs. and this morning I weighed in at 155 lbs. My low was 150 lbs.  I have been in the ""Normal"" weight range on the BMI scale for over a year at this point, fluctuating between 155-160 lbs. My weight has remained stable in this range. &nbsp; Some before shots: http://imgur.com/a/I6Np4 Before/After side-by-side: http://imgur.com/UJRNqAm &nbsp; It took me about a year to a year and a half to lose the weight. I did not keep any logs or precise dates, for which I must apologize.  &nbsp; I lost the weight without adding any additional exercise. In fact, I suffered from a deep depression shortly after those 'Before' fishing pics and barely left the house except to walk to my daughter's bus stop. (Which I had been doing for 2 years already while I was obese) I was so down and out that I would sit on the sidewalk like a lump waiting for my daughter's bus, until one day a man offered me food because he thought I was homeless. That left a deep impression. (Thank you anonymous stranger guy for caring about your fellow human being)  I lost this weight by completely overhauling my eating habits.  When I first made the decision to go for it, I began by strictly limiting my calories.   Typical day at the beginning of my weight loss was:  **Breakfast**: 3 cups of coffee with 1/2 & 1/2 and Sucralose for breakfast. **Lunch**: 2 Pieces of Whole Grain Toast with Margarine & No Sugar Added Jelly for lunch, or a serving of Old Fashioned Oats with Margarine, Sucralose, and Cinnamon. **Dinner**: 3/4 of a plate Steam Bag Veggies/Brown Rice/Potatoes, 1/4 plate meat. (I also switched to smaller 8"" plates) Some nights Pasta with Marinara. **Dessert**: No Sugar Added Canned Fruit.  &nbsp; After I lost a significant amount of weight, I added Oatmeal or Whole Grain Toast w/ Margarine & Jelly to my coffee & cream for Breakfast.  Yes, this sounds drastic, and it was, but I knew that I was able to draw hundreds of calories per day from my highly excessive fat stores. Also, I was getting around 300-400 calories from the coffees with 1/2 & 1/2 in the morning.  I was taking Vitamin D3, B12, Calcium to prevent deficiencies and Grapeseed Extract to help prevent my massive fat stores from aromatizing too much of my Testosterone into Estrogen and hampering my progress.   At the beginning I was very strict with myself. Once I saw the progress, I would allow myself to have sandwiches and other higher calorie items for Breakfast or Lunch. Though, I still relied heavily on butter toast with jelly and oatmeal.  Also, throughout this time I would go out to eat at a restaurant once on the weekend with my family. When I did so, I would try to order healthy items instead of ordering meat heavy or deep fried dishes like I had before. I have no real way to account for the calories of these meals, I didn't really consider them a 'cheat meal' I was just going out with my family to enjoy their company and have a meal.  &nbsp; Once I fell below 250 lbs., the number I'd not been able to break for many years, I began to allow myself a wider variety of foods, but I still kept all of the major changes that I made in how I ate.  Oh, and I almost forgot to add, I cut my alcohol consumption completely for the first part of my weight loss, and only allowed myself to drink occasionally after that.  &nbsp; Once I got to 150 lbs. I was shocked at how little muscle I had. That is when I decided to add exercise. I started with lifting a milk jug of water (~8 lbs.) every day. When I noticed how good I felt, I made it the first thing I did every morning. When the milk jug felt like nothing, I went out and bought a 20 lb. weight. That 20 lb. weight is better than any coffee I've ever had. I go from drowsy to wide awake with that thing. I still do 20 reps on each arm every morning with it.  I then added push ups, something I had never been able to do properly in my entire life. At first I could not do a proper push up at all. I felt like a weakling. I progressed to doing 2 sets of 15 push ups every day.  &nbsp; When I was a teenager I dislocated my shoulder and it required surgery with metal pins and over a month of recovery plus rehabilitation. My doctor said that I could no longer play football, that I could not do pull ups and many other things. He said that I have a 95% chance of dislocating it if I fell on it again. I wanted to destroy this barrier so badly. I started doing Ring Rows and Dumbbell Rows.  Just a few weeks back I did my first ever standing chin up. It felt AMAZING! I quickly progressed and I now do a mix of pull ups and chin ups every night before bed. The most I have done at this point is 10 in one session. I let myself down slowly to a hang, but I do sadly feel a weakness and discomfort in my damaged shoulder, so I probably have a way to go before I am busting out dead hang pull ups or chin ups.  &nbsp; A normal day now looks something like this for me: **Breakfast:** 2-3 cups of coffee w/ 1/2 & 1/2, 2 servings of Old Fashioned Oats with 2 TBSP of Vital Wheat Gluten, Vanilla Almond Milk, & Sucralose. **Lunch:** Salted Pita Chips Made with Canola Spray, a Bowl of Cottage Cheese & Sour Cream for dipping. **Snack:** 1-2 Cheese Quesadillas **Dinner:** Pasta w/ Sauce or Giant Baked Potato with Cheese, Green Onions, & Sour Cream or Grilled Fish w/ Loads of Veggies or a homemade Hamburger or something similar  **Dessert:** Heaping plate of Watermelon or smaller portions of other fruits (I still love the no Sugar Added Canned Fruit  I also add servings of Eggs, Cottage Cheese, or an extra quesadilla or something depending on how my weight and exercise performance is doing.  &nbsp; I now exercise every day. I have found that one of my biggest downfalls was a drowsy feeling that I often used to get. If I feel that coming on, I go do some quick exercise to alleviate that and I feel alert & positive after doing so.  I have written a blog that goes into more details about some of the changes I made, but I don't know if that is allowed here, so I did not add a link to it. Oh, and a few months ago I also got rid of my chair and I now have a DIY standing desk. This was a big help for keeping me feeling alert throughout the day.  &nbsp; If you are in a place in your life somewhat similar to where I was in mine in the before pictures, I just want you to know that you can do it. It is all up to you, but you most certainly can do it. Don't let anyone talk you out of it or make you feel bad about it because the other side of this journey feels SO MUCH BETTER than the beginning of it.  Thank you for reading my story! &nbsp; edit: Holy Paragraphs, Batman! What have I done? It's all jumbled together. I tried adding some double spaces, but I can't seem to make them stick.  &nbsp; *Ahh... Much better. I just had to bust out my non-breaking space fu.* Edit 7/21: Wow!! Thank you so much for all of your support and for sharing your progress and struggles! It really means a lot to me. Looks like I have a lot of reading to do this evening! :0)  &nbsp; **Edit:** Someone asked me about protein shakes, and I forgot to mention them in my post. After I lost some of the initial weight, I used Vanilla Protein Shakes w/ Almond Milk & Added Fiber as a meal substitute for breakfast or lunch. I usually used Soy Protein, but I sometimes used Whey.  What I found was that after my first phase of heavy calorie restriction, I would sometimes find myself not wanting to eat solid food for breakfast or lunch. So I would have a 16 oz. Protein Shake. These cold shakes with fiber did an excellent job of filling me up & soothing my hunger pangs.",Props to you and the fish. You both dropped a ton of weight.,368

3fanqm,"Little bit of context: at the beginning of the year, I thought I was around 26% bodyfat and would only need to go on a 3 month cut. I was sorely mistaken. As it turned out, I was more like 35% bodyfat and would end up having to cut for eight months. My weight before the cut was 227 lbs and right now I'm weighing around 161 lbs (I'm 5'10"" btw) Here are the pics: http://imgur.com/a/2fPbe My biggest takeaway is to never try dirty bulking. At the end of the day, you do pack on a fair bit of muscle, but you WILL have to cut for very extended periods of time. I would honestly suggest that lean bulking and gaining 1-2lbs a month tops would be the best strategy and to also not start bulking until you're at least under 15% bodyfat. As for muscle loss, I probably did lose a bit of muscle. My arms went from 16 inches to just below 14.5 and I lost a lot of the fullness I had before (although it's probably more to do with muscle glycogen and water). I'm a lot happier now and will probably reverse diet for five weeks before transitioning into a lean bulk. **Workout** Just a basic PPL split six days a week.  This would consist of the big four lifts (squat, deadlifts, bench and OHP) as well as isolation work for shoulders, arms and traps.  The main point of working out was to retain muscle and strength throughout the cut.  My strength actually increased during the initial months of the cut but has recently started to drop off due to the length of my caloric deficit.  Right now, I'd say my strength is slightly higher than it was pre-cut.  I'd also incorporate about 30 mins of ab work a week. **Diet** My diet consisted of mainly clean foods (chicken breast/tenders, greek yogurt, protein shakes/bars, oats, brown rice, steak and broccoli).  At first, my deficit was around 750 a day but I tapered this to around 500 a day six months into my cut to spare muscle. I am currently eating 1600 calories a day. **Stats** M, 161lbs, 5'10"", 19 years old.",Well worth the 8 month cut. Now you can recede back in to your natural habitat and start cutting lumber again.,2362
3fglgl,"So I've been a lurker on Reddit for a while now, and this is a Subreddit that I love to frequent, especially when I come across Transformation threads. For a while now I've been considering doing the same, but I had been terrified of doing so. As most are when they used to be incredibly overweight, I'm self-conscious when it comes to my body image. I used to be an overweight slob, which was brought on by binge eating because of my depression during my teen years, and which I still deal with today. Back then, I would eat to the point until I felt my heart begin to tighten in my chest, and while it was terrifying, there was a part of me that wished to go.  Album: http://imgur.com/gallery/Jkvbn (sorry, I'm new to Reddit!)   I started to turn things around when my grandmother passed away. I cut out all the sweets, sodas, and juices. My body went through a massive withdrawal phase, but I bit down and marched through it. I didn't have money for a gym at the time, but there was a nearby track that I could reach nearby. It was there where I started to walk and barely jog for a few seconds. Eventually, those few seconds before a minute and then a few minutes. That jog became a gradual run. That run became the 6-10 miles I would run every day. I started to add some body weight exercises to my runs too, but mostly I prided myself in my endurance and was content to keep it that way. At that point, I weighed at my lightest of 135 lbs.  Unfortunately, despite being able to see my abs finally, I had to deal with quite a bit of loose skin around my waist. It was a constant reminder of how I had messed up. That I had gone too far. There was a part of me that wanted to give up. I started to ramp up my exercises, but to no avail. I couldn't rebound from it.               Around this time my father became ill with cancer, and between school helping to take care of him, I started to taper off from working out as often. Then he passed on July 31st of 2013. Unsure of what to do, I found peace in lifting. My older brother introduced me to power lifting, and finding some Youtubers online definitely helped guide me along. However, it was slow going for someone that barely had any strength; going from a mindset of run, run, run to lifting primarily. I loved it though. During this time I found better work and started to save, having started to research what I could do with my extra skin. Traveling for some consultations took time, but it was worth it in the end when I found a surgeon that not only cared but had a great portfolio. I was terrified of the surgery, as it was my first ever, but I went in figuring that anything was better than what I had. Coming out of it, I was in no pain at all. Lifting had helped to tighten my  abdominals, so I didn't need to have them reset (which is where the majority of the pain comes from). I now have a 360 degree scar around my waist, and it took me roughly 2 and a half weeks to walk around normally, instead of the hunch back I had to be. The surgery took place in late February of this year, and I can share more pictures of this if you guys want. Anyway, now here I am at 160, in the middle of a cut. While I still deal with depression, I'm much happier, and slowly trying to get used to the idea of intimacy (I have a lot of stretch marks, so I'm crazy self-conscious about it). As for why I decided to post this all, it's because I know that there may be others out there like me. I want them to know that it's not impossible to turn things around. That it's not too late to have a better, healthy life. If there's at least one person out there that turns it around because of this, then I am happy. EDIT: to add a TL;DR -- I was fat, battled depression, but hustled through it. Now I'm not so fat! EDIT #2: Thank you for all the love guys! Trying to get to you all and answer any questions!

Thank you for all the PMs though! I'm trying to hit those up too. As a BONUS, I added two new pictures to the album that I took tonight showing my legs/backside, so I figured it would be helpful for those who likewise have had loose skin in those areas, and they could see that it CAN be tightened up.",Damn man you have all of my respect.

3fp96f,"TLDR: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aisKTlsni80) Hey Everyone,  [2014 ""Most Helpful User""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2req7z/winners_of_the_rfitness_best_of_2014_awards/) here. My apologies for not being around too often lately. I've been busy work'n 'n stuff.  This weekend I reached a goal I had set out (secretly to myself of course cause those goals are best goals). This goal was to get my bench press and deadlift combined weight to be 1,000 pounds or more.  In other words, **to make the 1,000 lb. club in two lifts.** And I did just that. Here's a few things I learned along the way which you may find helpful.  First, get quadriceps tendonitis. That way you cannot squat so it makes choosing what exercises to do so much easier! Psyche. Don't do that. I am however in that boat... so yeah :\ USS Nosquats **General Tips** 1. Make sure you're getting as much sleep as you possibly can. Seriously. Make an effort to sleep more. Simply training harder in the gym isn't going to yield results like just resting more does.  2. Gaining weight helps... **A LOT!** (But not required) So yeah, if you want to get big and strong you've got to remember to do what makes that first part possible, which is eat. Set a bodyweight you want to bulk up to. Be it 10, 15, or 20 or more pounds above where you are now. And once you get there just stay there for a bit. This is the biggest error I see when guys and gals ""bulk."" They get to their goal bulk weight and instantly start cutting. Don't do this! Get big and stay there a bit. Milk those gains for as long as you can. I suggest three months because in that span you could start and finish a pretty good training cycle that incorporates different training phases; hypertrophy and strength, for example.  If this was attempted during a cut it would be *significantly* more difficult. Once that training cycle is complete *then you have my permission to cut.*   3. Use a program or at the very least a set of training principals that are easy to implement that help assure you make progress. [This is the gist of what I follow.](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html) **Specific Tips** **Bench Press** Lots of volume! From what I've experienced training myself and others is that things like bench and overhead press require a bit more volume than what you would expect- or what common ""off-the-shelf"" programs have written. So if you're doing something like Starting Strength perhaps try to add three sets or so of bench at the end of your work out, maybe around 65% of the weight you used earlier that workout.  Don't be afraid of using a variety of presses either! Close grip, incline, wide grip- you name it. Hell dips would be a great addition. Give it a shot. If it feels difficult, and isn't hurting you, chances are you can progressively load it or use it to help accumulate training volume.  Practice with heavier weights more frequently as you get closer to your ""Test Day."" This will help you get used to handling those ""scary"" weights more confidently. That confidence will go a long way- believe me. But know this is a double edge sword... too much handling of those heavy-ass-weights can really run you down and sideline your progress quick.  Just be honest with yourself when it comes to your abilities to recover from this sort of thing. Otherwise you're shooting yourself in the foot.  One thing that *really* helped me with this on the bench is using a [Sling Shot.](http://www.howmuchyabench.net/) Seems gimmicky at first I 100% agree but [it has really helped my bench progress this last year.](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/how-sling-shot-saved-my-bench-press.html) If you've got one but don't know how to use it [I wrote up some stuff on ways that you can incorporate it into your training too!](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/saving-your-bench-with-sling-shot.html) This isn't required though. Just something I really enjoy using personally.  *Get your arms BIGGER!* Seriously. Bigger arms = a bigger bench. I'm talking about both your biceps and triceps. (Triceps for obvious reasons.) ""Now WTF does biceps have to do with benching, Cody?!"" Great question Trevor, sit down. By making your biceps bigger you're going to make the elbow joint more stable. Additionally, a bigger biceps is likely a stronger one and a stronger biceps can *help control* the flexion (bendy) of the elbow.  This was my biggest problem for the longest time. The heavier weights would just **drop** on to me, practically speaking. So once I figured that piece out I set to get bigger and stronger arms. Now, I can control the descent of the bar pretty well. Especially with weights that would nearly kill me previous.  *The control of the bar on the way down is imperative.* If it does not land in the right spot on your chest it is going to be that much more difficult to complete the lift. An inefficient ""landing zone"" means that by the time you get it 1/2 way up you're already out of gas. And then, since you think that's your ""weak point"" you start training that 1/2 way point...  And then you make no progress at all because you incorrectly diagnosed the cause of the problem. *Control on the descent is key.* The bar should always touch in the same spot. If it doesn't, fix yourself.  Ok, enough about the bench. We can talk about that more in depth in the comments.  **Deadlift** Ok, about the deadlift. First, I'm a firm believer in not Deadlift-Shaming people. Not everyone pulls the same way. We were all born differently. So just find how you can pull best that doesn't hurt you and you can recover from most easily. Sumo, conventional, rounded upper back, whatever.  A while ago I wrote [this article](http://www.schwarzenegger.com/fitness/post/six-years-to-six-hundred-pounds) on /u/GovSchwarzenegger 's website and the people here and in /r/weightroom really seemed to like it.  Article **TL;DR**: Interviews strong deadlifters. They give tips. I give tips too.  For a strong deadlift you'll first have to actually deadlift. Sure, you can probably get away with just a bunch of accessory movements but it's really going to help to *actually practice the lift you want to be good at!*  Next, you're going to want to have a very strong back. My go-to is pull ups. Why? Cause they're easy to recover from. They're fun. And they train your lats like a mofuggah and those things are kind of a big deal. If you can't do pull ups now check out the Armstrong Pull up program, or, you can read these other thingys I wrote over at /r/weightroom:  [Why you should be doing more pull ups](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/17sbvl/why_you_should_be_doing_more_pull_ups/) [Why you should be doing more pull ups 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/2ar2iy/why_you_should_be_doing_more_pull_ups_2/) Again, I followed my own method when it comes to programming but the gist of it was something like this: Spend a few weeks working from a deficit of 1-3 inches. Practice some heavy pulls from that deficit. Easiest way to do this is to just stand on one plate or two while the bar rests on the floor. This makes it much more difficult breaking the bar off the floor and it also does a wonderful job of strengthening your back.  Then I would do some more volume work from the floor. Just standard deadlifts here for reps. For me the weight on these was usually about 405 - 495 pounds. Five or less reps at a time here and around 5 or so sets. The fewer the reps per set you want to do the more weight you should be handling. Easy as that.  Then, since I couldn't squat (cause knee owie) I didn't do Front Squats. Which is my go-to deadlift and squat accessory.  What I did instead was just crush the living hell out of my back with a variety of rowing and pulling movements. Pull ups, rows, lat pull downs, you name it. These were all done in that 8 or more reps per set range of weight. Nothing too damn heavy here- you just got done pulling a ton of weight! Also, since I couldn't squat I would just crush my hamstrings too.  *Oh the looks I got going back and forth from lat pull down to hamstring curl machine...* Train with and without a belt too. Nothing makes your abs stronger than working some moderately heavy deadlifts without a belt. This helps you focus on proper bracing and breath control. Here's two excellent videos on that:  [Chris Duffin is a gangster.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcY3YSW9vX4) [Chad Wesley Smith is literally a mastodon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G_ot0-98NU) If you cannot brace and position yourself correctly before the start of the pull then it's going to be so much harder to get it off the ground. Remember the landing zone for bench? Yeah, this is like launching off an aircraft carrier. Position yourself properly and jettison that bar into orbit because you're about to rip that bar off the ground.  **Summary** Bulked up. Followed some very basic training principals. And BAMCIS! there's a PR.  Seriously though, this is a wall of text so I'm ending it here. I know I barely scratched the surface on a lot of this so please dig through those links I dropped. Visit /r/weightroom it's a great resource in itself. And of course if you got a question drop that shit below and I'll do my very best to answer it! ... or any other number of very qualified individuals who find their way here will.

3gendo,"First off, pics: Here's me at 18 and about 105lbs. I was weak and extremely depressed. Even for 5'4 I was way underweight: http://imgur.com/a/uDB85  Here's an updated pics about 2 years later: Front http://i.imgur.com/KWleW17.jpg  Side http://i.imgur.com/DvaEOzB.jpg  Back (shitty quality. back pics are hard to do apparently) http://i.imgur.com/CqvqnJ8h.jpg  Fitness experience: I played pee wee soccer when I was 9, but I was mostly in it for the capri sun and orange slices.   I've been on hormone replacement therapy for just about 2 years, and lifting seriously for 1.5 (the other six months consisted of me doing a ton of cardio and machines and expecting muscles to magically appear under my pillow). I weigh 142lbs  Starting out was pretty rough for me. For any extremely small or generally unfit person the weight floor is pretty intimidating. I had a fairly unexperienced friend teach me a little about dumbbells and form. I had just graduated from the soft and vaguely moist cradle of machines to the wide world of freeweights.  Though I had a few moves and a semi-decent routine in my pocket, I still knew almost nothing about diet. Being an obsessive neurotic I chose a 6 day split. The intense training and my tiny, 1500 calorie diet meant that the only progress I made was from the testosterone naturally carving out my body.  Diet: Eventually I figured out what a proper diet meant and I started making decent gains. The feeling of going from not being able to lift a 45 pound plate onto the leg press to benching my bodyweight is indescribable. Even with my knowhow my anxiety would often get the better of me, and my weight fluctuated from 136-125 frequently. That might not seem like a lot, but on such a small frame 10 pounds makes a big difference.  My lowest weight was in march at 123 after I got top surgery. I started a 3200 calorie/day bulk  supplemented with creatine. I gained about 20 pounds in 3 or 4 months.   Unfortunately I started (and am continuing to have) problems with severe untreatable acid reflux (kill me) so I fear that my progress may plateau again.  Lifts: Bench: 2*165 Deadlift: 1*275 Squat: 1*225 (though after having knee problems I've replaced normal back squat with front squats supplemented by the leg press for that round ass) EDIT: I was temporarily removed by the mods, but I'm back baby.  EDIT 2: I mistyped my deadlift. It's 275, not 175. I'm weak, but not that weak  EDIT 3: The thread is locked up for the night. Thanks to all of you for the support, and to the mods for keeping out the trash. I'll be away for several days, but PM me if you have any big important things to say and I will get back to you when I return","you look good before and after, but you do look more comfortable in the after pic. congrats on being able to find confidence in weight training, it's an awesome stress reliever. what's your tattoo of??",1799

These things are adjustable, so you can just put them 1cm above your chest which barely affects your ROM, and it feels much safer. Actually since I arch my back when I bench press my nipples end up being above them so my ROM isn't affected at all, and in case of failure i can just relax my back and the bar will just rest on them. It's very simple and it works well so I don't get why this isn't implemented everywhere?",If you aren't risking death it is not a real lift.   *gun shots,4154

3muq18,"""Squeeze your buttcheeks"" is the best form cue ever, for everything. It's something that many beginners don't do, especially if you sit a lot or work at a desk. Human asses are so big and shapely because they're one of the strongest muscles in our bodies and we are supposed to use them for almost everything. However, for many of us (me included), our modern societies have created a situation where our booties don't get regular use because we sit down all day -- in couches, in chairs, in cars, in subways -- to the point that when we *do* participate in an activity where a caveman would use their butt, we don't, because we're not used to it, and because it's no longer comparatively stronger than the surrounding muscles. If you don't use your butt to help you move around throughout the day, you're using your body wrong. Here are some helpful tips: * Overhead press: Squeeze your buttcheeks. You can't stabilize your core at higher weights without it. * Bench press: Squeeze your buttcheeks and you'll be able to put up a little more weight. * Deadlift: Squeeze your buttcheeks AS HARD AS YOU CAN. * Squat: You better believe you gotta squeeze them buttcheeks. *<-- See edit* *Edit: While this is true, you don't necessarily want to be thinking about squeezing your glutes the whole time. Just be sure to use your glutes/hips to drive yourself up, keep your core tight, and be sure to not use your lower back instead of your glutes. Look at [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3muq18/squeeze_your_buttcheeks/cvijqa8) for better info. Okay, back to the buttcheeks.* * Plank: Squeeze your buttcheeks. * When standing: Squeeze your buttcheeks, a little bit. This uses your butt instead of your lower back to stabilize you. If your lower back gets sore from standing a lot, this will help. If you have anterior pelvic tilt, this will also help correct it. **tl;dr:** Squeeze your buttcheeks.",[Like this?](http://i.imgur.com/4X8HjTp.gif)  edit: mild nsfw?? You be the judge,1346

So, this video is a culmination of all the things I find scrumptious, but organized into a logical sequence.  * The logical sequence meaning... we warm up with gentle prone or kneeling poses (childs pose, wrist mobility, cat cow, sphinx pose, wake up the core with bird dog etc). Then we move onto standing poses (lunges, sun salutations) where we can intensify things. Eventually we transition slowly back to the mat, doing a bit more deep release with seated/kneeling poses (quad/hipflexor and hamstring stretches) to supine bridges and twists until finally we rest. * If you want the full list of poses and what they do, read [this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3nldsg/after_months_of_editing_i_am_happy_to_share_with/cvq7e8g)",Nice video!

So I've ridden for 45 minutes twice  a day for four days so far.  Doesn't seem like enough to allow me to run 2.5 miles without difficulty but I guess it adds up.

I know i only ran 2.5 miles but i could have easily done three miles. I got off the treadmill because the gym was closing and i still had to shower.  Update:  Dem typos!!  Went back to the gym this Sunday and jogged 3.11 miles.  Woo Hoo!!!  Also, I did not itch at any time during this jog.  Amazing!  Amiracle!!  I think it's because I took a 45 minute fitness class before I hit the treadmill.  My capillaries were already warmed up and so could not torture me 10 minutes into my jog.  It took me 20 years to figure out how to get rid of that itch!!!  ","This just proves that the easiest way to get more fit is simply getting more active. Even if you don't make out time to exercise, if you would just find ways to stay off your backside most of the day, you'd just get naturally fitter. That's one of my favorite ways to think about fitness. For me it's a lifestyle thing. The more active I get the fitter I get. Even small levels of activity add up to a great level of fitness over time.Thanks for sharing this.",946
3ouq1l,"Hi all, I'm training for my first bikini competition. I wanted to show my [back progress thusfar](http://i.imgur.com/3EwkeBz.jpg?1) because I am proud of the work I've put in. First picture was taken June 12 at about 155 lbs, the second picture was taken October 11 at 130 lbs. Thoughts on my progress? Anyone here competed in a show with tips for motivation/any advice as I am now about 4 weeks out? **EDITED with more info on my routine and diet, per sub rules, as well as requests** I will say, my back has responded the best out of all the areas of my body. I've been doing a focused back day, once a week, with the following exercises as a typical routine: * Lat pull down (as wide as I can possibly go) * Superset of seated cable row and lower back extension * Single arm bent over dummbbell rows * Facepulls * Single arm cable pull downs * Bent over barbell row The above has been my main routine, but I sub in some exercises occassionally, including  * Deadlifts * Wide double arm cable pull down * Renegade rows Everyday, I also do a lot that helps the core in general (core meaning stomach/abs, lower back, core area) such as plank variations, mountain climbers, etc.  A little about my diet: 5-6 meals a day of 4-5 oz lean protein (white fish or chicken), and 1cup green veggies with each meal. Carbs usually hit about 80-100g/day, and they vary between oats, sweet potatoes, brown rice and rice cakes. Additionally, keeping my fat between 20-30g/day, sometimes less. (God bless buff bake peanut butter protein!!) I think it's important to say though, that my diet is strict, and I haven't varied AT ALL from it, and I am also doing a large amount of high intensity cardio, both of which play a role in my muscle exposure. Additional pictures: * [Front progress](http://i.imgur.com/bRf4grC.jpg) * [One pose](http://i.imgur.com/CT8aOVX.jpg) * [One more pose, for fun](http://i.imgur.com/sp8eV5V.jpg)","I compete in mens physique. So im aware of the grind and grit leading up to competition. With regards to bikini competition... remember its mostly about posing and looking good as an ""overall"" package. Individual assessment of body parts is irrelevant because they look at the whole package so to speak. actual bodybuilding is where they judge a lot more. But you can have a so-so ""physique"" in bikini, but destroy the posing and do really well. Confidence is also a huge, huge factor to doing well in bikini. Dont look at the ground, look directly at the judges, SMILE the whole time. ACT like you WANT to be there, like you have already won. Above all else on show day, dont worry about much. The work is done, you have trained for it, you are as ready as you are going to be. So just go and have fun. I see too many people get all serious and nervous and end up looking weird on stage.  Good luck, its a rush being up there under the lights in front of everyone. OWN, IT. BTW, 4 weeks is an eternity at the end of prep. Stay on course, you will get even leaner in that time. Practice your posing daily so it looks natural. edit: PS, also... you have some great definition in your back. You actually look more like a physique model than bikini, just from your picture alone anyway. ",731

About 600 calories with minimal carbs 2.5 hours before a workout and about 1000 calories after.  With no calories outside that window. During the lowest calorie portion of my fast my daily meals were generally. 2:00pm: Eat a chicken breast /w hotsauce and some asparagus. 4:30pm: Do strength training focusing 2 muscle groups as described in the main post. 6pm: Eat a chipotle burrito bowl with no cheese or sour cream, extra beans and meat. Take a fishoil and multivitamin.  Eventually I added a protein shake to this once I'd hit my weight goal. As for the workout.  My buddy and I would generally workout 5 days a week and pick a set of two muscles that we hadn't worked on in the last two days.  Chest/Bis/Tris/Shoulders/Upper Back/Lower back or an entire day for legs. On a non-leg day we do 3 different exercises for both muscles in sets 12,10,8,6,12 increasing weight for each successive set until the final set which is lower than the first.  The goal in choosing the amount of weight to just be able to complete the chosen amount in the set. As of 8 months ago I started running 4 miles while in a fasted state every morning.

3qft9h,"[According to this article in Wired](http://www.wired.com/2015/10/who-does-bacon-cause-cancer-sort-of-but-not-really/), processed and cooked meat does increase risk of colon cancer, but far less than smoking cigarettes increases risk of lung cancer. > The scientific evidence linking both processed meat and tobacco to certain types of cancer is strong. In that sense, both are carcinogens. But smoking increases your relative risk of lung cancer by 2,500 percent; eating two slices of bacon a day increases your relative risk for colorectal cancer by 18 percent. Given the frequency of colorectal cancer, that means your risk of getting colorectal cancer over your life goes from about 5 percent to 6 percent and, well, YBMMV. (Your bacon mileage may vary.) “If this is the level of risk you’re running your life on, then you don’t really have much to worry about,” says Alfred Neugut, an oncologist and cancer epidemiologist at Columbia. The same tiny risk profile appears to be present for other red meats. Anyway, the article is worth a read. And if you are a smoker, quitting is still the #1 thing you can do for your health. EDIT: [Smoking also is correlated with colorectal cancers](http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/23/1888.full) and you can [lower your risk for colon cancer by exercising, losing weight, drinking less alcohol, eating more fiber in the form of whole grains and vegetables](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/features/six-ways-to-lower-your-risk-for-colon-cancer), and getting regular screening after the age of 50.

3ql4ww,"http://imgur.com/a/kskHx I've posted in here before about my transformation but really wanted to detail everything and what I have learned. Apologize for the text wall.  First two photos in the link I was 17 at 300 pounds/5 foot 10 Next two was today at 24 years old and 185 pounds/6 foot At first I ran my ass off and didn't eat anything. Extremely dumb but I knew nothing about fitness or nutrition. I was just trying to get in better shape for baseball. I went from 300 to 235 pretty quickly. I don't recommend that method at all. Highly stupid.  I fucked around with weights for a while not really following any plan. I still ran a lot. Usually two miles a day. All I had for resistance work was a total gym. I got down to 185 and couldn't bench one plate because I had no muscle from running.  Around 22 years old I started to get serious finally. My plan was essentially a bro split. Arms, chest, legs, shoulders, back, repeat. Stopped doing cardio completely.  All rep ranges were 8 to 12. I got my bench up to 205, squat to 245, and deadlift to 315. Not the best but I was content.  January of this year I started a pretty big bulk. I was usually eating around 2000 cals a day and I jumped it up to around 3500. My diet consisted of too much protein (I ate 225g at 185lbs) and probably close to 10 servings of potatoes a day. I also followed intermittent fasting which is crazy to do bulking but I have a stupid big stomach apparently.  I quickly shot up from 185 to 207 by March. My maxes went to 260 bench, 300 squat, and 400 deadlift.  I always saw that people would cut and not lose strength and I didn't know how. Every time I would cut I would go from 3000 to 1700 calories and expect good results. I would essentially crash and then cheat and binge. It was a never ending circle.  I finally decided to get some discipline in March and tracked everything I ate with my fitness pal. Every week I would get on the scale and monitor my weight. Subtracting calories from 3000 little by little.  In the gym I would do legs, shoulders, back and biceps, chest, repeat. I keep my rest times long and focus on compounds for the first part of the workout. Usually 8 sets of 2 or 5 sets of 5. Then I would move on to a 6 to 8 rep range for 5 sets. Then I would finish with a 10 to 12 rep range for 5 sets. Example leg day - 8 sets of 2 deadlift. 5 sets of 5 squat. 4 sets of 10 lunges. 5 sets of 12 leg curl. Done.   This worked incredibly well and while taking away calories I have kept my strength in all exercises or went up in strength.  My diet right now (close to the end of my cut) consists of 1900 calories. 150 to 160 protein. Rest is filled how you like. Leg day is more carbs. Shoulder day is less carbs, etc. 5 grams of creatine a day. A shitload of water as well.  Usually I eat two servings of cream of wheat before my workout in the am. A potato with no fat cheese after working out. Then dinner is a huge bowl of zucchini, cauliflower, spinach, avocado and chicken. Never get tired of it and so good.  I look forward to finally putting on some much needed mass and will do it exactly how I did my cut. Slow and controlled.  I will be happy to answer any and all questions that anyone has!  Edit : THANKS to everyone that has replied on here. Fucking amazing. I'm trying to answer everyone's questions. As one comment said, I am not special. I am normal. You can do it. Anyone can do it.

After reading a bit about him, I bought his book dedicated to heavy lifting for amateur women. It detailed everything about weight-lifting/weight loss from the beginning, and I was so thrilled I decided to follow the program to the T!  **The exact program I followed during the 3 months**  | Day  | Excersizes     |:-----------|------------:| |     **Monday** -  Chest and Abs |          Bench Press (3 sets, 4-6 reps)  |Incline Bench press (3 sets, 4-6 reps)  |Dumbell Incline Bench Press (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Dips (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Cable Crunch (3 sets, 15-20 reps)  |Leg Raises (3 sets to failure)  |Air Bikes (3 sets to failure)  |------------------------------------------------------|       |     **Tuseday**  - Back  |          Barbell Deadlifts (3 sets, 4-6 reps)  |Barbell Bent over Row (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Dumbell one arm row (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Close grup Front lateral pulldown (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |------------------------------------------------------|  |     **Wednesday**  - Shoulders  |          Military Press (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Barbell up right Row (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Lateral Raise (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Dumbell Bent Over Delt Raise (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |------------------------------------------------------| |     **Thursday**  - Arms  |          Dumbbell alternative Bicep curl (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Tricep pushdown (V-Bar) (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Barbell Curl (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Dumbell seated Tricep Press (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |------------------------------------------------------|   |     **Friday**  - Legs  |          Barbell Squat (3 sets, 4-6 reps)  |Leg Press Machine (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |Romanian Deadlift (3 sets, 8-10 reps)  |------------------------------------------------------|  These workouts take around 45/60 minutes each (so not so much!).  **HIIT-training**: In addition to these gym session I did High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) in the form of running 3 times a week, each session being 20 minute.  (HIIT-jogging: You jog for a minute, sprint for 30-60 seconds, jog another minute, jog for 30-60 seconds again etc. until you reach around 20 minutes. There are great free apps for this type of workout, for example ""HIIT interval training timer"") ------------------------  **Calorie Counting** As I wanted to get leaner I cut during these 3 months (I was at a calorie deficiency). To calculate what my daily macors (fats/proteins/carbohydrates) and calories should be for good weight-loss, I used the following formula for my starting weight (also taken from the book). 1. Eat 1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight each day 2. Eat 1 gram of carbs per body weight each day 3. Eat 0.2 grams of fats per body weight each day For me that became 163 grams of protein per day (1,2 grams *136 lbs), 136 grams of carbohydrates per day (1 gram *136 lbs) and 27 grams of fat per day (0,2 grams *136 lbs). You then use these values to count your daily calorie intake. 1 carb is 4 calories, 1 protein is 4 calories and one fat is 9 calories.  I calculated about 1300 calories per day, which I followed exactly during those months. -------------------------------------- And that's all I did! Simply put my body feels great now and just filled with power. When I run I feel springy on my feet, when I play with my friends and family I use my body with joy because it feels so strong. And that is something I want to convey. Not only is heavy lifting a great way to get lean/look good if that is your main concern, but the changes to the *feeling* of your body is amazing. One of the best decisions I have made in my life :) The 3 months was an intense workout-effort, but once you get there maintaining what you achieved takes very little effort! (I go to the gym 1-2 a week and that's it, I look more or less the same as when I just finished the intense training period now one year later. When I maintain I go once a week with the following excersizes (also taken from the author): Squats *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*, Deadlift *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*, Bench Press *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*, Barbell Row *(3 sets, 8-10 reps)*, Military Press *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*  My purpose with posting is to perhaps help some other girls/guys out there like /u/sknick_ / helped me, and show them the amazing progress that is possible with weight-lifting!   Thanks for looking guys! If you have any questions hit me :) --------------------------- **EDIT:** Thank you all for your wonderful words, and I'm thrilled to have inspired so many! :) I hope you all take amazing progress-shots, and share them!!!

3uo738,"Hi! Now to preface this whole ordeal I'd like to point out that by no means am I any competitive powerlifter, but the point of this is less my numbers on the bar and more about the way resistance training have helped me with my illness(es). Ill be pointing to this when friends over at /r/thritis and /r/rheumatism want more info on what I've done.   **Pictures first so you don't have to scroll:** [Before \(oh my, embarrasing\)](http://imgur.com/a/lHXNr) [Now](http://imgur.com/a/rXDZY) [Now - undies with pathetic attempts at flexing \(NSFW\)](http://imgur.com/a/ePN9J)  **Backstory:**  Im going to make this as short as possible and if you have more questions about my medical history feel free to ask, Im pretty open about it. Im 29 years old and I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis when I was 16, and ended up in a wheelchair with raging inflammations.  I've since then added to the autoimmune lottery winnings with Ankylosing Spondylitis (aka Bechterews) and Uveitis as well. I suffered rheumatoid cachexia and Ive naturally been struggling with fatigue, pain and depression as symtoms.  Long story short I have been treated like a china doll all through my late teens and adult life due to this, which I've hated. Every movement felt painful. Muscle waste had lead me to being ridiculously weak, not being able to lift a milk packet over my head or get up from sitting position without help or pain. I couldn't walk for more than a few hundred meters at the time, and those were in pain. I was as sedetary as could be, with the exeption of a ""soft approach"" type of physical therapy they tried on me which seemed to just exhaust me further (lots of cardio and swimming).  During all these years I struggled with weight. Partially due to the cachexia, the sedetary lifestyle, and depression - but man my diet was awful. I tried fixing this a few times by dieting, and successfully lost weight a few times, but man it piled on quickly again when I stopped going under 1200 kcal. I ballooned up to 85kg/187lbs-ish at my heaviest with a BMI of 33.  **The turn around:** Summer 2 years ago I had an epiphany of sorts, or you could say I hit rock bottom. I realized I was in pain and miserable all the time anyway so why not be in pain with a purpose?  I started dieting, again. But this time instead of just cutting down on calories I made sure (after reading up on Cacexia on my own) to get enough protein in. I started walking, adding a little more distance every day (""to those trees next time""), and gradually worked myself up. I added resistance training when I read up on Ankylosing Spondylitis and saw all the research on the benefits of. I started off with 2lbs dumbbells at home around 2 years ago. Yes, I know everyone laughs at these things but these were heavy to me at the time. During that year (2013-2014) I lost the brunt of my excess weight, and went down from ~85 kgs/187lbs (probably higher, I didnt step on the scale until a few weeks in) to 70kgs/155lbs. I consider this time my ""rehab-year"" as the strength I accumulated here was basically just getting somewhat back to a normal sedetary human bean level.  **Starting building some strength:**  I'd always been interested in the barbell and was looking forward to starting with it as I was rehabbing. The gym I had closest to me had no barbells. So I bought my own, and set up shop in my guesthouse. I think I got to around a 155 lbs squat and 180lbs deadlift from May to November 2014.  I really didn't bench any. Slow progress, Im aware, but I was still losing weight and battling everything else. November 2014 I made a decision to join a powerlifting gym. This might have been one of the best decisions Ive ever made. The atmosphere and familiarity was a huge boost, and I've since compteted a couple of times in smaller local meets just for fun.   **Lifts progression:** I'd like to cut these up in three instances:  1. At start of rehab (mid 2013) 2. When joining PL Club (late 2014) 3. Now Squat:  1. Couldn't get down and up from a chair without help. 2. 155lbs/ 70 kg with bad pancakeform 3.

Bodyweight: 1. ca. 187 lbs/85 kg (obese) 2. ca 155 lbs/70 kg (overweight) 3. 134 lbs /61 kg (healthy BMI) And just for good measure...: Hiking (non stop):  1. Maybe 100 painful meters. Used a wheelchair and crutches for when I had to move further. Or just didn't go.. 2. 5-7 km. 3. 25 km.  **Diet:** I went down under 1200 kcal for a few months, then upped that to 1400 kcal when I started hiking daily.  The last year I've lost weight without counting calories, but Im very active instead, and so Ive lost weight gradually. Having sometimes counted in between just to check, I seem to have a BMR of around 1900-ish now.  I don't track any other macros than a rough protein estimate, trying to hit over 80gr a day minimum.  I don't eat pork because that seem to trigger my inflammations more. I eat a lot of veggies because they're yummy. As a typical islander I eat a shitton of fish. I will eventually try to get stricter with my diet to lose a little more fluff for vanity and the sports sake (going down a weight class). Im not experiencing any excess skin. Some stretchmarks, but other than that Im good. **How have this all affected me outside of fitness?** * I dont use painkillers on the daily anymore. I used to not be able to go through the day without them, even though I've always hated how they make me feel. This is one of the greatest benefits of all. * I feel confident. I even feel pretty occasionally! And damn, feeling strong is amazing. Especially when you know what its like having felt so very weak. * I'm able to work at a higher % than I used to be. * I'm limber.  * I sleep better. * Im all around happier. I feel like I can handle things better. The only things that have given me a bit of a tumble have been life events that would give anyone a bit of a tumble. Im functioning quite well and Im actually looking forward to the future. **And what now? Im gonna keep lifting. Im gonna keep a high protein diet. I wanna get good enough to compete at least on a national level (in Norway) even if I might not reach the top 3.** And Im gonna keep preaching the combo of protein and lifting to other people in my position. I dont expect this to work for everyone, nor am I so arrogant as to think Im not lucky for this having worked for me.  But if you were like me, and in pain and miserable without any hope for the future, try! My rheumathologist even told me to ""keep up whatever it is you are doing""! So yes, yes I will.

3yn9sr,"I lost 40 pounds in 67 days.   Before and after: http://imgur.com/16BnlKA  For backstory, I went through ugly stuff two months ago and was low as hell.  I decided to lose weight.   I counted calories (myfitnesspal app).  I ate 1600-1700 a day, lots of peanut butter, eggs, chicken, hamburger, almonds, and low-fat dairy, along with fruits and vegetables.  I quit drinking, cut out breads/grains, and didn't eat many processed foods.   I was in terrible shape when I started.  I hiked for exercise the first month.  It avoided stressing my joints.  I got a pedometer and did ~10 miles a day.  The second month I kept hiking but dialed it down and started lifting.  I do a 4-day cycle including deadlift (regular and romanian), front and back squat, bench, rows, and military press, among other stuff.  I also hit abs everytime I lift, about four or five days a week. I lost a lot of weight quick but didn't starve myself.  I ate a solid diet and ran caloric deficits through exercise.    To anyone with weight to lose, my advice is to start counting calories and then avoid the scale.  I didn't weigh myself for the first 40 days.  I didn't care.  I knew I was running a caloric deficit and losing weight.  Obsessing over day-to-day weight loss would have been stupid. Hit me up if you want to know anything.",Watch for gallstones.

I will be competing at the Arnold Sports Festival in Ohio this March to try and attain that goal.  It has been my goal that before 2015 ends, I will pull 4 plates. This pull was pretty ugly, the bar got caught on my pants and ripped the seams up pretty bad, but with some baby powder I am sure it would have gone up smoothly.

3yxetl,"######First, photos and stats: * Height: 5'11"" * Age: 30 * Before &After Photos * Starting weight: 240 lbs. (109 kg) * Current weight: 200 lbs. (91 kg) ######TL;DR Decided to get healthy, and in shape before I turned 30 years old, and did something about it. Lifted weights, counted my calories, and worked hard. No special diet program, just simple stuff that almost anyone can do. ##Summary A little over 9 months ago I looked at myself in the mirror (literally, and figuratively), and I didn't like what I saw. I was a 29 year old, very overweight, lacking motivation, and confidence. My energy levels were low, and I knew it was effecting my family (wife and kids). I was tired of it, and wanted to finally do something about it. ________ ###Phase 1: Lose Fat ASAP ######March 2015 – June 2015 (3 months) * **Eat Healthier, smaller portions** – I knew I was super over weight, so I needed to lose fat. I used [LoseIt App](https://www.loseit.com/), and counted everything that went into my mouth. I calculated my TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) using online calculators, and adjusted my calories about every 2 weeks. * **Lift Weights** – I started lifting weights with a friend of mine who had already been lifting for a few years. He taught me the ropes, and helped introduce me to some starter routines. During Phase 1, I did a basic Push, Pull, Legs (PPL) routine. I split this between 4 days per week (M, T, R, F). * **Light Cardio** – I did about 15 minutes of cardio 2-3 times per week after lifting weights, just for some cardiovascular health, and to help with the weight loss. * **Macronutrients** – I aimed for about 200g Protein daily, and then didn't really count my carbs or fat. * **Calories** – I ate anywhere between 1800-2000 calories a day. * **Example Daily Meals**  * Meal #1, 4 egg whites, 2 eggs, cereal * Meal #2, 6oz. Chicken, sweet potato, veggies * Meal #3, Preworkout: Protein Bar * Meal #4, 8oz Protein, carbs, and veggies * **Cheat Meal** – Every 7-10 days, I'd have a cheat meal. Note: NOT A CHEAT DAY. Just a meal. This meal I would eat whatever I wanted, as much as I wanted. Usually it'd be a couple greasy burgers, chinese, or a pizza. These meals gave me a little something to look forward too, and also helped push off my weekly cravings. * **Favorite Meal**: [Qdoba](https://www.qdoba.com/). You can get a LOT of protein packed into very little calories, if you order right. I love Qdoba. * **Ending Weight**: 198 lbs.  ###Phase 2: Gain Muscle ######June 2015 – October 2015 (3 months) * **Eat a lot** – I like to eat, so this phase was much easier for me. I actually probably gained too much weight, too quickly, and I will be changing that in my future ""bulk"" phases. * **Calories** – I aimed for about 3300-3500 calories per day. * **Example Daily Meals**  * Meal #1, Lots of eggs (8-10), protein shake, and cereal * Meal #2, 8oz. Chicken, sweet potato, veggies * Meal #3, 8oz. Beef w/ noodles * Meal #4, Protein bar, PB&J Sandwich * Meal #5, 8oz Protein, carbs, and veggies * Meal #6, Before bed: Yogurt, or cottage cheese * **Macronutrients** – My goal was about 220g-250g Protein per day, and filled the rest of my calories with carbs and fats. * **Weight Training** – Because I had so much more energy, I added in another day in the gym. So I began going 5 days per week. I gained a lot of strength during this phase too, which I attributed to the amount of calories I was consuming, and better form/technique that I had been developing with the help of my friend. * **Challenges** – People talk about dirty bulks vs. clean bulks. Dirty bulking is obviously easier, and much more enjoyable. You basically eat everything you see, without regard for anything. I probably fell somewhere in between dirty and clean. I think it's good to find a balance, because if you do it too dirty you'll end up gaining quite a bit of fat. Like I did. * **Cardio** – None. * **Favorite Meal**: Donuts for breakfast, and Burgers for lunch. Ya, not healthy at all, I didn't eat this every day.  * **Ending weight**: 232 lbs  ###Phase 3: Cut the weight, reveal gains ######October 2015 – December 2015 (3 months) * **Calories** – Basically went back to what I was eating in Phase 1. 1800-2000 calories per day. With a cheat meal every 7-10 days. * **Trying to keep strength** – I really feel I have my routine, and form dialed in right now with my weight training. Currently I'm doing a split that is kind of a mixture of a PPL, and ""Bro-split"". I really like it, and I feel exhausted after every workout, which is good. * **Cardio** – I try to do cardio once per week, but honestly I often skip it. I'm really trying to get more consistent, because I know that it's good for my cardiovascular health. But it just hasn't been top priority for me. * **Current Weight**: 200 lbs. * **Weight left to lose**: ~15 lbs. ________ ##What Motivated me? Honestly my biggest motivation came from wanting to prove myself wrong. All my life, I've just accepted that I was overweight, and that it was pointless to try and do anything about it. I ate food for comfort, and when I was stressed. Every time I went to buy clothes, I dreaded it, because I knew nothing would fit ""just right"". I hated looking at myself in pictures, and always secretly felt embarrassed. I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it, and that **it doesn't have to be complicated**. ##So what's next? 1. Enjoy life more with my family, friends. Get out and do things that I could/wouldn't do previously. I just want to be the best I can for them. 2. Take my shirt off this summer, and feel confident! 3. Keep losing weight! I'm wanting to diet down to about 10% bodyfat, and then start another bulk phase. This time, doing it more clean! 4. After this time I've spent working on my diet and training, I've really gotten into bodybuilding, and I considering trying to compete in the future. I know I'm still a long ways away, and I'm pretty old to begin competing, but I don't care. I just want to give myself a new challenge. ##Biggest thing I learned? 1. **Failing is ok** – I had many days where I felt I had ""failed"". But I had to keep reminding myself why I was doing what I was doing. So the next day, I would just start over, with a clean plate, and get back on track. I had to remember that it was a ""marathon"", not a ""sprint"". Failing is ok, just get back up the next day, and move forward. 2. **It doesn't have to be complicated or expensive** – Honestly the biggest thing I learned is that getting in shape isn't rocket science. No matter what anyone tells you. All these instagram fitness coaches, supplement businesses, and ""weight-loss magic"" sellers, are just trying to make money. Some of their products might assist, but none of them are a replacement for hardwork in the gym, determination/commitment, and a balanced diet. I didn't follow any ""special program"". I just stopped stuffing my face with food all the time, and starting going to the gym a few times per week. ##Final thought. Was it difficult? Yes, many days were struggles to go back to the ""old me"". Would I go back to how I was before? No way in hell. ________ For those interested, here is a simple breakdown of my current weight lifting program. I do this 6 days/week, Monday-Saturday. * Day 1: Chest, Quads * Day 2: Back, Hams, Glutes * Day 3: Shoulders, Arms #####Edit 1: Adding More Training Details ######Basic Workout Breakdown: This is a basic example of what my average workout looks like. Some days I'll sub in different exercises, but this will give you a good starting point. Workout A | Workout B | Workout C | ---|---|----| Flat Bench 4x10 | Deadlift 4x10 | BB Military Press 4x10 | Incline Bench 4x10 | Wide-grip Pulldown 4x10 | Narrow-grip Bench 4x10 | Cable Chest Fly 5x12 | Seated Row 4x10 | DB Shoulder Press 4x10 |  DB Chest Fly 5x12 | BB Row 4x10 | Tricep Cable Ext. 5x12 | BB Squat 4x10 | Facepulls 5x12 | Overhead Tricep EZ Bar 5x12 | Leg Extension 5x12 | Leg Curls 5x12 | Preacher Curl 5x12 |  Calf Raises 5x12 | BB Hip Thrusts 5x12 | DB Curl 5x12 |  Abs | – | Abs | ######Weekly Split: I basically rotate my workouts like this on a weekly basis. (Note: when I'm in a cutting phase, I might take an additional rest day on Wednesday too.) Mon | Tue | Wed | Thr | Fri | Sat | Sun ---|---|----|---|---|----|----| A | B | C | A | B | C | Rest #####Edit 2: A couple more tips 1. **Weigh yourself everyday!** A lot of people say not to do this, but I'm a firm believer in doing it. I believe it helps you get more familiar with your body, and how it works. You see, and understand the fluctuations in your weight throughout the week. If you only weigh yourself once a week, you could be weighing yourself when you're retaining a lot of water, or not retaining. And you could get discouraged if you are up a pound or 2 after a week of eating well. If you weigh yourself DAILY, then you see these fluctuations constantly. (e.g. of how my weight would fluctuate. I weighed almost every day for the last 9 months.) 2. **Take at least 2 photos a week**, to track your progress. I can't emphasize this enough! The scale isn't always the best way to track your progress, as you can see from my progress pics. I weighed almost the same in my before, and after phase 2 pics, but my body composition was much different. If I had only relied on a scale, I could have been discouraged by this. But I had plenty of pics to look back and see. ","I'm just as impressed with that format of the post. Sexy and easily readable.

3z8bkm,"Hi r/fitness! This is just my personal success story. Many times along the way, I came into this sub (along with r/loseit and r/progresspics) for inspiration and motivation and I believe it helped me get through some of the harder days when I just wanted to give up. I still remember the day, I was watching my son in swimming lessons, looking at the gym in the same building and wondering if I could do it. I have been overweight most of my life and never thought I could really lose the weight.  It was April 2013 and I made a goal for myself the next day.  I was going to be 165lbs by the time I started Nursing School in September.  I downloaded MyFitnessPal and started counting calories. I worked 10 hours a day in a highly physical job but made myself go to the gym every night after work for at least an hour. I had one training session where they taught me to do a half hour of weights and a half hour of cardio. I stuck to this routine religiously and the weight just fell off. It was the middle of August 2013 when I got on the scale and it read 164lbs. I cried so hard that day. I had hit the goal I set for myself and was more confident than ever. I will never forget that day! Fitness has turned into a passion for me now. Its part of my life. It got me through nursing school and many hard times in my life.  Many days after a long day at the hospital, I come to the gym to unwind and rejuvenate. The gym is my escape. I head to the gym when I am happy, sad or just bored. I cant picture my life without it now. I have gained great friends, immense knowledge and an appreciation for this body I live in that I never had before.   I have never stopped setting goals. When I hit one PR, I start working on the next. I believe that is the key to my success - constant goal setting and a thorough determination to be better than I was the day before.  Now the good part - Pictures!! Before: http://imgur.com/a/qNLSG After (Today): http://imgur.com/a/jTFnU Thanks for reading! :)  Edit: Diet is the most important key to my success, I believe. When I started I kept my calories around 1500/day. I exercised using weight machines and mostly elliptical, for an hour a day, at least 6 days a week. As the weight started coming off, I continued to count calories but changed my routine to a more endurance based program, with lower weights and higher reps. I then went to a 5x5 strength gaining program and started incorporating squats, deadlifts, etc. Thats where I really found my love. I have a true love for heavy lifting!! I basically have done a combination of all of those things for the last couple years. I change it up every couple of months to keep things interesting and make further progress. Now, I am counting macros. It is the best thing I have done, by far. It started as a challenge with a girlfriend to eat 100g carbs/60g fats/150g protein each day for 30 days. I also added a lot of cardio with weights type exercises and HIIT training to my regime. It worked wonders. I continued past the 30 days and lost a total of 8lbs in 45 days. It toned me up fantastically as well. The first 20 days of eating by those macros just about killed me but I am  so happy I did it and I continue to eat close to those macros today. I want to maintain the body I have now and maybe tone up a bit more.  Edit#2: Thank you all for the lovely, kind words! I am absolutely overwhelmed by the response! Thank you all so much! I hope I can inspire even just one person to believe in themselves and do what has always seemed to just be a dream.  I wanted to answer some questions this morning, but I came online to find the post locked and I am unable to comment directly to people :(. So I'll answer a bit here.  Yes I squat 225! I max out for squats at 235, bench at 140 and I can pull a 250 deadlift. :) I am super proud of those numbers! I absolutely have issues with excess skin and stretch marks. It is getting better everyday, and I credit the weightlifting for that. I did lose the weight suddenly at first, but the gradual toning up (thanks to weight lifting) over the last few years has helped to make the skin a little less saggy. I still have quite a bit of extra skin in the thigh area. Maybe one day it will look better than today, but I have gotten used to it. ",Holy swole mother of F A C E G A I N S ,1354
3znn0e,"I figured since we're starting off a new year, I'd go ahead and share what kind of progress can be made in time frames that someone starting up a resolution can realistically expect.   **Maybe slightly NSFW for underwear picture** [August 2014-Jan 2016 progress pic album](http://imgur.com/a/MRA8s) As a little background, I was in the military from 2007-2011, and this gave me a very basic starting point. I could have made a lot of progress and been pretty strong during this time, but the lack of education around nutrition and exercise really did not allow me to excel. The entire time I was in, I floated around 200 pounds until it came time to cut weight for PT tests, which I only ever passed by the skin of my teeth. As I was getting out, I started gaining quite a bit of weight just because I was no longer being required to exercise for a few hours a day.  By 2014 I was not much better off than when I had joined the military. I was up to 230 pounds in July, and started a new job which allowed me to walk around a lot more than I had been, and in the downtime I was able to browse this subreddit(which I think is truly the number one reason why I was able to stick with this). I wanted to lose a little bit of weight but really had no intention of becoming very involved in the way of fitness. In August, a coworker of mine had mentioned that they were going to Planet Fitness and the price sounded really appealing, so I signed up for a year contract.  As anyone who has browsed this subreddit for a day knows, a 5x5 program is pretty much the standard for beginners looking to get stronger. I REALLY wanted to do one of those, but Planet Fitness completely lacks the necessary equipment to do one properly. So I found a dumbbell program that I thought would cover everything I'd need. It was basically a M-Upper W-Lower F-Upper split for about 7 months, and doing some runs before and after my lifting. At this point I was really focused on losing weight, and dropped from 230 to 190 pounds between August and early January by meticulously logging my calories in MyFitnessPal. I was consuming 1600 a day without many missteps. I was consistently losing 1-3 pounds a week and was overjoyed by the progress I was seeing. The best part about the dieting was how little effort I really had to put in to make it work. I was eating fast food, mostly Taco Bell, at least 3-5 times per week, but since the calories for those places are so readily available I had 0 issues keeping myself in line.  By January I was becoming I started becoming interested in running some 5k races, and started training a little more for those, with less focus on the lifting. I still went to the gym, but at this point I'd reached the max weight on the dumbbells for my DB bench press(75 lb per). From January to March/April I'd been able to get my 5k time from about 40 minutes to 26, and dropped from 190 to 168 at my lowest weight. I was attempting to do a 5k race at least once every week or two, but once May hit, availability started to taper off near me. Probably something to do with temperatures in Texas? This is the point where I feel like shit started to pick up quick.  I bought a house in March, and my workout buddy and I decided to split the cost of a cage and 300 lb barbell set. We started SL5x5 in May(with the bar) and at the same time I decided to eat more so I could get the most out of my noob gains. At this time I'd never even touched a barbell except to attempt a bench press a long time ago. I'd never done a single squat, deadlift, ohp, or row in my life.  I consistently was able to keep putting weight on the bar from May-August, where I kind of stalled a bit with the following lift numbers -  Squat - 250lb 5x5 Bench - 205lb 5x5 Deadlift - 315lb 1x5 OHP - 115lb 5x5 Row - 170lb 5x5  I went from 168-190 by the middle of August, and my progress had stalled,so I got a little bored. Decided to move on to PHUL to mix it up a bit. I Had a lot of fun with this routine, and noticed some size gains(especially legs), but really didn't make a lot of progress numbers wise on any lifts. I just kind of felt tired all the time with the increased volume. We ran this program from August until late November, when we decided to start doing the Texas Method, which I'm currently on.  The time spent doing PHUL leg volume did wonders for my squat and deadlift once I actually started on a more clear cut linear progression again. My numbers went to Squat - 250lb 5x5-> 295lb 5x5 Bench - 205lb 5x5->220lb 5x5 Deadlift - 315lb 1x5->365lb 1x5 OHP - 115lb 5x5->125lb 5x5  With my numbers improving as they did, I decided to test out my 1RM to see if I could manage to get a 1000 lb total on New Years Eve.  I managed to get a 350lb squat, 265 BP, and kind of took it easy on deadlift and did 385 to make it exact. I'm pretty confident I can do around 410 as a max deadlift, but probably not within the same hour as a max squat. I was so excited about being able to do that. I was pumped, and sore as hell for the next few days.  What surprised me the most about all of this is how simple the whole process was. Lose weight: count calories. Lose weight while lifting: count calories, count protein. Gain strength: eat more, count protein. All of this information being in the wiki and seeing it consistently work, and how well it works really kept me motivated the whole time. Having workout buddies that were consistent in working out with me was also pretty critical to my success. Watching other people progress with you while doing the exact same stuff is pretty amazing.   **TL;DR** Count calories, lift weights, read the wiki, find people to be active with, and have fun! **Possible Bulge Warning** [Progress pics](http://imgur.com/a/MRA8s)   .

407ty5,"After 3+ years of trying, i finally was able to do my first pullup!  I have a mild disability called Erb’s Palsy which has given me a 3” difference in arm length.  Being able to finally do this was super important to me.  I've tried to do one about once a week but it's always felt like I was literally tearing my shoulder to pieces. The biggest help, I think, was learning how to actually activate my lats in the deadlift.  Once I figured out how to do that for stability, I was able to get them more active in the bench, and in variations of rows (lat pull down, seated row, t bar, etc).  I believe that I have always been able to activate the left lat properly but not the right one, which really shows in my physique (and stability on both sides of my body).  Lately I’ve been treating the LPD as a shorter movement and trying to very specifically pull with even force on both sides.   Generating evenly distributed force is something that’s always been an issue for all of my lifts.  Learning a better activation will hopefully get my bench out of the gutter as well.  I’m heavily incorporating incline bench, slingshot bench and dumbbell bench in my current training cycle to give myself some additional practice while building my lagging stabilizer muscles. Current program: GZCL Jacked & Tan. Previously: Sheiko, Texas Method, Beyond 531, some BulgMet style randomness. I’m not sure I’ll try these again for a while, they didn’t feel that great and I don’t think they fit into my current programming but it was fun to do once.  If anyone has any questions about training, programming or living feel free to fire away.

40niwq,"Hi Reddit, Thought I would like to share my experiences and knowledge of my progression so far, as well as the improvement of my own home gym.  I apologize in advance that this is a pretty long post but I'm hoping someone can learn from my many trials and errors. Here is a progression of my front: [Front](http://i.imgur.com/WoUQnIA.jpg) Here is my progression of my back: [Back](http://i.imgur.com/qNTqEcV.jpg)  **Beginning Learning Phase** As you can see, in January 2012, I was a very skinny guy.  Weighting at 135, I was that guy who would complain that my high metabolism was the reason why I could not gain any weight.  I used to think I was eating a lot, and I certainly did indulge in mainly potato chips, sodas, and fast food.  Looking back, I probably only ate two meals a day so I probably ate less then 2000 calories daily. Tired of being scrawny, this led me to working out in the gym, hoping I can start growing some muscles (even my own family made fun of how scrawny I was).  So like the typical gym newbie, I mainly concentrated on bench press with horrible technique, abs, abs, abs, abs, and probably some abs. With no results showing, I started looking elsewhere.  P90X?  That sounds awesome.  And all of my friends were suggesting that I'm a hard gainer and I should be eating at a huge bulk.  So I discovered myfitnesspal, decided that I know better and that I should bulk at 3000 calories, and stuck with it. With all of the craziness that comes with P90X, I was forced into doing things like pull ups, plyometrics jump training, yoga, wall squats.  Hated it all but soon, the numbers started going up.  I can do more then 1 pull up, I can do more then 3 push ups.  And even though I worked a desk job, spent 5 hours playing World of Warcraft every night, and assumed I had no flexibility because I was a guy, yoga really started improving me a lot. All this, and I was still consuming 3000 calories daily.  Gotta bulk right?  So as you see in September 2012, I ballooned up to 150 lbs.  I looked in the mirror and compared it to all of the P90X before and after pictures, and thought What the hell...  why don't I have ripped abs after all this? Miserable, exhausted, but not beaten, I opened up the nutrition book on P90X and realized I should try their weight loss nutrition.  I lowered my calories to 1800 calories as recommended and whatever macros they recommended.  I started eating peanut butter, chicken breasts, rice, protein shakes, and made sure I only ate 1800 calories or less. Interestingly enough, this is where I learned about **iifym**.  At the time, my girlfriend always wanted to go out and eat, so I started searching myfitnesspal to see what I can squeeze into my 1800 calories of macros.  Even used to squeeze in Korean BBQ in there from time to time. Anyways, behold my P90X result in the end of December.  I was ripped, leaned, and look at those shiny abs poking through.  Then that moment hit when looking at the mirror and I thought...  I want bigger muscles.  I look lean but I just look like a skinny guy with abs and I don't like this.  I weighted 127 lbs at the end of this.  **Weight lifting and injuries** Being a big P90X fan, I decided to check out Body Beast.  It taught how to do more weight lifting at home, and honestly, it wasn't that bad of a program to teach someone new.  God I hated leg days...   so a few months of doing this program, and eating around 3000 calories again, I did start gaining weight pretty fast.  But I thought, gotta bulk to grow! Sometime around 2013, I wound up injuring my left wrist from being an idiot on a punching bag.  This put me on a cast and I wasn't allowed to lift weights for a solid 4 months.  During this time, I did some running here and there to try to keep some of my weight off.  **Barbell Lifting** Once I was given the okay to lift weights again, this is when I decided to take a step back, and actually research.  Why did I gain weight so quick?  How come people bench press or deadlift?  With all of this knowledge in mind, I started to learn each of the main moves.  About 2 months into it, I then discovered 5x5 Stronglifts.  I cannot praise this enough...  if you are new and want to learn how to barbell lift, please please please look into this.  With this training going, my bulk method was to eat around 2200 calories until I don't gain weight for a week solid.  If I don't gain weight, go up 50 calories and continue. By the end of my barbell lifting bulk, I was 145 lbs.  My squat was at 5x5 of 200 lbs, bench press at 5x5 of 170 lbs, and deadlift of 5x5 at 200 lbs.  I praised on lifting the main moves, and counting macros to everyone.  I told people that it doesn't have to be organic foods, or that a soda's sugar won't kill you if you start counting the carbs and calories from it.  Yet, everyone laughed and told me I was being stupid and I don't look lean so what do I know?  I should be eating organic ""healthy"" foods only and do a lot of cardio.  **Cut Phase with no cardio and Chipotle** So I made a bet with someone.  I was going to start my cut in November 2014 so that I can look ripped for February 2015.  I will eat Chipotle and it's sodium filled deliciousness EVERYDAY, a lot of red wine on the weekends, along with doing only 5x5 stronglifts. I researched on how to cut properly.  Try your best to lose weight slowly, do not rush down to a ridiculous amount of calories.  Once the weight stops going down, then cut a few more calories and stick with that as long as you can.  While cutting, try your best to retain as much of your strength as possible.  With this knowledge in mind, I dropped from 145 lbs to 131.6 lbs. Mind you, I lifted 3 times a week, doing strictly 5x5 Stronglifts and I liked to do yoga once a week.  No cardio at all.  And I literally ate at Chipotle everyday...  sometimes even twice a day.  And the red wine?  I probably two bottles worth each weekend (alcohol is the 4th macro btw).  **Maintenance** From February 2015 to July 2015, I decided change my workouts to a push pull legs program, and  understand my maintenance calories (Maintenance calories are when you do not gain or lose weight at your current lifestyle).  My lift numbers went up a little, with my squat at 5x5 of 210, bench at 5x5 of 175, and deadlift at 5x5 at 245. I started watching youtube videos and following people on Instagram.  Looking at Timbahwolf Kane eating shin ramen so often made me started eating it daily.  Watching Layne Norton talk about how metabolism works, and how to incorporate macros made me realize how I can fine tune how to gain or lose weight.  **Bulk** Since September 2015, I decided to go on a bulk.  I want to get stronger and bigger.  The more muscle you have, the more you need to eat to fuel that body.  To me, that sounds like a win win situation.  When bulking, you will grow muscle but will gain some fat along the progress.  So you could go yolo and eat like a maniac but you'll have a lot of fat to lose when it's time to cut.  Or you can bulk at a steady pace and try to gain as least fat as possible. Since July 2015 to January 2016, I have been slowly bulking from 138 lbs and currently sitting at 145 lbs.  I no longer do a 5x5 structure but have stuck with my push pull legs program.  My current one max reps are squat at 280 lb, bench at 210 lb., and deadlift at 340 lb.  I am looking to bulk for a few more months before I cut again.  **Summary and what I've learned** If you are skinny and have trouble gaining, go learn how to barbell lift, learn how to count macros, and bulk slowly.  Anyone skinny who wants to look ""toned"", you're going to look pathetic when you lose your body fat because you have no muscles poking out to show off.  Go bulk. If you're looking to lose some weight?  Learn to count macros, lower calories slowly, and don't be afraid to lift weight.  Growing muscle takes forever compared to losing fat, and you will not become massive overnight. I cannot praise barbell training enough.  Learn how to properly squat, learn how to properly bench, and learn how to properly deadlift (I still spam Layne Norton's tutorial videos during my warm up just so I don't forget anything).  Start with a 5x5 program, and throw away your ego.   Honestly, if I can go back in time, I wish I could have just started off with barbell training and counting macros correctly.  **Home Gym** [Home Gym Progress](http://imgur.com/a/LR3Kv) I started off with some Bowflex weights (don't buy them), a pull up bar, a yoga mat, and some basic weights.  Once I started squats, I picked up a set of Valor BD-9 stands.  Don't waste your time with them unless need their mobility.  They are a pain in the butt to keep setting up every time. Once I committed and bought a squat rack, this changed my world.  Worth every penny.  No longer do I have to go to a gym and fight others for the rack cage.  And no longer will I feel guilty of doing bicep curls in the rack cage.  ",You became the real Super Saiyan bro. Congrats! EDIT: Typo.,454

During 3 controlled intervention days HIGH's water intake was restricted to 1 L/day whereas LOW's was increased to 2.5 L water/day. Several mood scales (Bond & Lader Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Profile of Mood States, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, Thirst & Emotional VAS) were administered at different time points during the study. ANOVA including intervention, time point and intervention by time point as fixed effects on mean values (i.e.; baseline data vs. mean of 3 intervention days) for each mood scale was performed. >RESULTS: >At baseline HIGH and LOW were comparable in mood state, except for thirst scores (estimate = 17.16, p<0.001) and POMS depression-dejection scores (estimate = 0.55, p<0.05) which were both higher in the HIGH vs. LOW. In HIGH the restricted water intake resulted in a significant increase in thirst (p<0.001) and a decrease in contentedness (p<0.05), calmness (p<0.01), positive emotions (p<0.05) and vigor/activity (p<0.001). In LOW, increased water consumption resulted in a significant decrease in fatigue/inertia (p<0.001), confusion/bewilderment (p = 0.05) and thirst (p<0.001) and a trend to lower sleepiness (p = 0.07) compared to baseline. >CONCLUSION: >Increasing water intake has beneficial effects in LOW, especially sleep/wake feelings, whereas decreasing water intake has detrimental effects on HIGH's mood. These deleterious effects in HIGH were observed in some sleep/wake moods as well as calmness, satisfaction and positive emotions.  Of course, there's the problem of lack of comparison against placebo treatment, but that could be hard to test given that water is already the most inert substance that we can drink.  Said that, I still think this study is very relevant, since both groups felt coherent changes. More importantly, when people drank 2.5 L of water they felt better, and that's what we all want, isn't it?",Drinking more water makes me more awake because I am constantly in the bathroom...CONSTANTLY!,773
4136rd,"Before & After: http://imgur.com/Ffs8inq A little backstory. It all started a few years ago when I went to the bowling alley with a group of friends and I was unable to curl the 8lb ball. Pretty big eye opener that made me want to hit the gym. I thought at first it would be nearly impossible, but my buddies gave me a hand and were my gym partners from that day on. My goal weight is 155 pounds and hopefully someday I'll reach that goal. Regardless I am pretty content with this transformation. **Edit 1**: I see that I must provide more information to how I achieved this transformation. I will provide one soon.  **Edit 2**: Sorry work got a little busy, anyways.  First and foremost I ordered this [weight gainer](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/whey.html) to help me gain some mass. To my embarrassment, yes the picture on the left was weighing at approximately 100 lbs. That was during the time I just ate once or twice a day. I changed that eating lifestyle to eating at least 4 time a day with two protein shakes, one in the morning and one before bed. I also took some preworkout (Jack3d, C4) to give me that boost of energy necessary to rep some weights. As far as for workouts and reps, my buddies were my trainers. So I will try my best as to what exactly they made me do each day.

41dtz7,"I lost over 200 pounds in about 2 years. People all say that’s insanely fast, but they don’t realize that it was 4 years more of mentally even grasping what needed to be done to achieve this goal. In my early 20’s I realized that I had a problem and spent four years experimenting with programs, fasting, working out, losing 100 and gaining 75 back.  In April of 2014 I started seeing an eating disorder councilor and that was a world of a difference. She completely changed how I viewed food and my own worth. That was the catalyst to my weight loss and new lease on life.  I started over all at 400+ pounds. I had chest pains, I couldn’t/wouldn’t move and food was a coping mechanism to get through each day. I went a year on fasting at 1000 calories and working out  90 minutes each day. I got to 275 and gave up when I realized it was too hard. I gained back up to 372 and the pains set back in. I was scared and realized my mentality was what was holding me back. I was only 24 years old, I still had a chance to really do what I needed to succeed in this journey.  Since this post will already be so long let me bullet point it How I started: First counting calories and seeing where I could make small adjustments in the food I was eating Lost 20-50 pounds and had new energy/confidence. I started very light cardio 3 times a week Improved foods, cut carbs only because of the calories and not as filling as protein. Went Keto… never go full keto. I was tired a lot, dropped a ton of weight but didn’t have the energy needed for the workouts I wanted to start doing. Hit mid-lower 200’s and really started incorporating weights Under 200 and the gym is life. I go 5-6 days a week now and have a trainer. I switch my program up every 8 weeks and go from heavy lifting, to HITT, circuits, heavy cardio ect.   Here is my current program:   I eat around 1600-1900 calories a day and meal prep weekly. I use MFP and plan out my meals 1-2 days in advance. That predicted deficit gets me excited and keeps me motivated to stay on my meal plan.

I have been lifting since college, 35 years. and running with a few triathlons thrown in there over the years. I have been lucky with injuries no real ""damage"" but do have aches and pains. As you get older you have to remember you aren't 20 and do what you used to do. As a life long work out guy, you look at others your age or even younger and your hard work pays off.

42xyvo,"Hey everyone, I just started counting calories and I noticed it's hard as hell to get enough protein. I'm 185 lbs roughly, and every time I eat a meal it'll be like say 600 calories but only 30 grams of protein. My protein shake is just 26 grams of protein at 150 calories, I feel like if I actually eat enough protein, it'll go well over my TDEE - 500 calories. So I just wanted to know what some of you guys eat in order to actually get enough protein. EDIT : I'm seeing so many replies, thank you for all the tips and suggestions and meals that you guys are giving.

43llv4,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/how-to-lose-weight-and-gain-muscle-fast-new-mcmaster-study-1.3423359 Two groups were compared: The high protein group (2.4 g/kg) gained 2 lb of muscle and lost 10 lb of body fat. The low protein group (1.2 g/kg) lost negligible muscle and lost ~7.7 lb of body fat.  Thoughts? Will these findings influence your next cut? or your diet? It has certainly made me less concerned about losing muscle mass during a cut. ,ITT: People who think broscience > actual science.,859
44nna6,"http://imgur.com/a/gsBnx EDIT: I AM IN HIGHSCHOOL ALREADY Soooooo, here we are. I'm a 14 year old from Texas. Obese since the sixth grade, prediabetic since 7th. I honestly don't know how it got as bad as it did. I mean, we were poor and sometimes we had to just get by on a box of cereal for the day so maybe that was it.  Either way, on June 13th, 2015, I posted on /r/diabetes asking if it was a reversible disease. I got referred to /r/keto. This is where I started. I started eating only 20g of carbs a day, strictly. I never counted calories and I basically didn't pay attention to anything other than that. I also drank only water. I kept this up for a while. It was really easy because during the summer I would just stay up all night playing world of Warcraft, and have bottles of water everywhere and instead of snacking I would just drink water if I got hungry. This is how I lived for a while.  Then school started. I kept up my carb counting for the majority of the first semester. In December I started getting out of that and just ate less and only drank diet sodas and water. This is basically where I am now. I haven't gained any weight back.  So that was the nutrition, now let's get to the lifts(u mirin bro?). No, seriously, I did start lifting. I joined my schools track and field team in January and joined powerlifting. I'm set to be in football next year. Before this I would go to the gym a minimum of once a week but usually three times a week. I never did any routines because I didn't know how to do most free weight exercises correctly.   Since then I've been training a lot. Usually during the day we do speed weights which is however many Reps you can do in 45 seconds of whatever station you're at. Usually it goes -  Chainsaws@75lb Military press@45 Dips Lat pull downs@135 Bench@135 Squat@225 Power cleans@115 Leg press@200 After school is basically the same, except we don't do speed weights we just go everything 3x15.  My half mile is 3:50 now. Powerlifting:  With powerlifting, at first I was scared, until I realized it's only three lifts and the worst that happens is you scratch the weight for that try. So as of right now, here's my stuffs:  Squat: 295 Bench:175 Deadlift:315   So yeah, that's my stuff. I did this whole transformation in six months. That picture is from July 4th. To yesterday. If I forget anything let me know and I'll be glad to throw in a quick edit. ","Even your present facial expression and body language exude health and confidence. You look awesome; congrats!

45i2ew,"http://imgur.com/gallery/qqLWu I'm posting this again bc I believe my last post was removed from me not sharing enough detail on how we lost the weight.  I lost my weight over the course of about a year and a half to two years. My weight peaked at 325lbs and the doctor told me that I could effectively take 20 years off of my life expectancy if I didn't make dramatic life changes. I lost 130lbs by doing 5 workouts per week as follows: * Monday: Cardio  * Tuesday: Upper body strength * Wednesday: Cardio * Thursday: Lower body strength * Friday: Cardio For my cardio I always did alternating intervals of high and low resistance, switching every 4 minutes for an average of 45 to 60 minutes per session. I'd also be sure to change up the mean of cardio about every two weeks. So for example, I'd do the elliptical for 2 weeks and then switch to stairmaster for 2 weeks, etc. For my weight loss diet I always stuck to lean meats, mostly chicken, and fresh fruits and veggies. I didn't scrutinize my calorie count but I eyeballed it to where I'd get around 2,000 per day.  Once I reached a weight of around 195lbs using this routine I switched to a strength training regimen that has gotten me to my current weight of 225lbs (I am 6'4"" btw, that's why the number is a bit higher than my weight actually looks). Here is my routine: * Monday: Chest, Tris, Shoulders * Tuesday: Back, Bis * Wednesday: Abs, Legs * Thursday: Heavy lifts, 20 min elliptical and HIIT sprints on treadmill * I also try to walk at night and on the weekends. I maintain at around 3,000 calories on lifting days eating (40p/40c/20f) and around 2,500 calories on off days eating (40p/20c/40/f) My wife lost her weight more recently than I did. She had gotten up to 165+ pounds and decided to change her lifestyle in an to get healthy and feel better about how she thought she looked. She is now around 120lbs @ 5'5"" and sticks to mostly a vegan diet. She fell in love with running and typically runs the equivalent of a 5k race (3.1 miles) around 4-5 days a week and does body weight exercises in between. She ate 1,200 calories per day while she was losing her weight and now eats around 1,500 calories per day to maintain. It's been a lot of work but our lives have dramatically improved and we feel so much better! Let us know if you have any questions!

My wife and I have worked so hard to get to where we are, and I promise all of you who are in the midst weight loss or about to get started that every single drop of sweat, scoop of protein powder and tears spilt are validated in the end. Getting healthy will be the best decision you'll ever make in your life, I promise you! Thanks again, y'all :)","Do you do your hair before you take gym pics? Also, that is not the same woman.

45x5ek,"I've always read we should all be eating a lot of fiber, and an analysis by ""Myfitness Pal"" also found that a high increase in fiber also led to the best weight loss results.  I eat pretty healthy, a good serving of veggies with lunch and dinner, fruit pretty much daily.  But I know I am not even in the same ballpark as the daily 38 grams of fiber that is recommended for men. Do you guys take supplements to get to the fiber intake you need?  Or does it just take a lot of vegetable intake and some wheat bread?   Also for those taking fiber, has it made a big impact on your appetite?  I'm interested in fiber because as a graduate student with 2-3 exams a week, I have less time than I usedto have to exercise.  Decreasing my intake seems to be my best bet for dropping the 10 or 15 pounds of fat that I replaced my muscle weight with over the past year.","calories in vs calories out. Foods high in fibre tend to keep you full for longer (veggies, brown rice etc). Result= easier to stay in a deficit and thus more consistent weight loss. It will not magically increase your weight loss but appetite will be noticeably less assuming you get the fibre from food and don't supplement it. ",2132
463qt8,I've been working out for quite a while but decided to get a Personal Trainer for a few weeks to check it out. They are making me do sit ups but I always thought it was a waste of time...Thoughts? edit1: Thank you everyone for the answers and feedback! edit2: So the majority of people are saying that yes it is a waste of time as there are better workouts such as dead lifts/squats/other exercises that work out the abs/core and that sit-ups are bad for the spine. edit3: Wow this post really blew up! Sorry I have been pretty busy so I haven't been able to read everyone's comments. edit4: Some people say its good if you like doing it and that it will protect you from other exercises by making your abs strong by doing sit-ups first. ,"Yes, sit-ups are pretty much a waste of time. The core activation in sit-ups is minimal compared to other exercises, and they place undue stress on the spine. Research by Dr. Stuart McGill is pretty much the gold standard on this area if you want to learn more.  In addition to the stress on the spine, the primary function of the abdominals isn't concentric – it's isometric. That is, your abs can contract and move your torso, but most of what they do is provide stability and protect your spine.  For that reason, a lot of trainers split their core work into four categories: anti-extension (front abs, the six pack), anti-flexion (your back), anti-lateral, and anti-rotation. Basically your abs are resisting a particular action, fighting to keep your spine in neutral. Examples in each category (in order): plank, deadlift, one-arm farmer's walk, woodchopper (oblique twist).  Hope that helps!",2602
46fxfr,"At the end of last year, I read a book titled Living with a Seal, where the author had a Navy Seal move him with him and his family for 31 days. His reason for doing this:  > I felt like I was drifting on autopilot in my life. Wake up, go to work, go to the gym — repeat. I wanted to shake things up. I wanted to get better. That really resonated with me. I’m sure a ton of other people in here feel the same exact way. We get stuck in the same routines in life, and in the gym. So I knew that I wanted to find a fitness challenge this year. At the same time, I remember reading about The Rock’s workout and nutrition program in Muscle & Fitness last spring. I was fascinated that he was able to do that. We all sort of write it off like “oh, but he has trainers and a private chef or takes illegal substances” but at the end of the day, that’s a ton of commitment and dedication. And he has done is while his career absolutely exploded over the last few years. I decided to see if I could do the same thing, see how I measure up. This isn’t about following a fitness and eating plan that’s optimized for me. It seemed like too much food for a guy my size. It’s also not about using this plan for specific results. I have no desire to look like The Rock. It was just about “can I do this really hard thing this successful guy does while living a normal life?”  **The Eating** Meal 1 – 10 oz cod, 2 whole eggs, 2 cups oatmeal	 Meal 2 – 8 oz cod, 12 oz sweet potato, 1 cup veggies	 Meal 3 – 8 oz chicken, 2 cups white rice, 1 cup veggies	 Meal 4 – 8 oz cod, 2 cups rice, 1 cup veggies, 1 tbsp fish oil	 Meal 5 – 8 oz steak, 12 oz baked potato, spinach salad	 Meal 6 – 10 oz cod, 2 cups rice, salad	 Meal 7 – 30 grams casein protein, 10 egg-white omelet, 1 cup veggies (onions, peppers, mushrooms), 1 tbsp fish oil	 *Calories: 5390, Carbs: 533g, Fat: 97g, Protein: 430g* **The Training** Monday – 50 minutes elliptical, Chest Workout		 Tuesday – 50 minutes elliptical, Legs Workout		 Wednesday – 50 minutes elliptical, Arms Workout		 Thursday – 50 minutes elliptical, Back Workout	 Friday – 50 minutes elliptical, Shoulders Workout			 Saturday – 50 minutes elliptical, Legs Workout (repeat)		 Sunday – Rest **Chest** Incline Barbell Bench Press 4x12/10/8/6		 Flat Bench Dumbbell Press 4x12			 Incline Hammer Strength Press 4x12 (Alt arms, start extended)		 Flat Bench DB Fly 3x12			 Cable Crossover Superset w/ Dips 3x15/Failure			 **Legs** Leg Extension	4x25		 Leg Press Superset w/Weighted Walking Lunges 4x50/40	 Hack Squat Machine	4x20	 Romanian Deadlift 4x12	 Lying Leg Curls 4x12	 Standing Calf Raise 5x75	 Seated Calf Raise 5x50 **Arms** *Biceps – Perform all 3 as a Tri Set, Rest One*	 Preacher Curl w/ EZ Bar 4x12	 Standing BB Curl w/ EZ Bar 4x12		 Dumbbell Curl	4x12	 *Triceps – Perform all 3 as a Tri Set, Rest One Minute Between*	 Rope Pushdown 4x12	 Rope Overhead Tricep Extensions 4x12	 Triceps Dips to Failure 4x12		 **Back** Pullups (Wide Grip) 4xFailure	 One Arm DB Row 4x12/10/8/8	 Hammer Strength Two Arm Row 4x10	 Close Grip Pulldown 3x12		 Cable Row (Double Drop Set) 3x12	 Rope Pullover Super Set w/ Rope High Row	3x15/15		 DB Shrugs 4x12 (15 sec hold end of each set)	 **Shoulders** Hammer Strength Shoulder Press 4x12/10/10/8		 Seated DB Shoulder Press 3x10	 Standing Side Lateral Raises	4x12	 One Arm Cable Side Lateral Raise 3x20	 Reverse Fly Machine	4x12	 Bent Over Lateral Raise 4x10 I’ve made it more than half-way through already, and am currently on Day 17. It isn’t easy, all about just keeping the discipline and grinding through it. **Things I’ve Learned** The hardest part actually is the food prep: having to make 7 meals a day, every day, for month is hard to do with a full-time job and a family to take care of. if anyone is interested, I can share more details about this. Though I’m 6’3”/207lbs and The Rock is 6’5”/260lbs, I haven’t gained any weight eating 5,000 calories a day. I would have thought at this surplus it would have led to putting on some weight. But I’m noticeably building muscle while getting leaner. Podcasts and Audiobooks! This is how I spend 2+ hours in the gym 6 days a week. Music just doesn’t hold my focus for that amount of time. I also feel like I’m getting smarter and bettering myself in the process. I feel great. I’m 37, around the time when mysterious aches and pains pop up. Eating like this is preventing any muscle soreness or DOMS. And I’m lifting heavier than I had in awhile. Makes me realize I definitely haven’t been eating enough, and that sometimes your body needs high glycemic carbs (something I’ve avoided for years). Eating like The Rock isn’t cheap. It’s costing me about $42/day, putting this whole experiment at a monthly budget of almost $1300. It’s mostly the cod that gets you, that alone is $18/day. This experience has been eye-opening for me, especially how the nutrition is affecting my workout. Kind of blew apart some cutting/bulking views I had. Thought /Fitness would benefit from what I'm learning. Questions or comments? Fire away.	 (edited for formatting)",Will you be posting before/after pics? It would be interesting to see how 5000 calories a day and NOT gain any weight would look. keep it up man!,1722

48dnk1,"Hey everyone, I thought I would share my experience with an 8-week cut I just put myself through. The very high level overview of this cut is as follows: 1600 calories/day, bro-split with added cardio, minimal loss of strength, now aesthetically content. Pictures speak a thousand words and are always what I look for in these threads, so here are the before/middle/after pictures: [Resting](http://i.imgur.com/VuP6gJM.png) [Ab Flexed](http://i.imgur.com/p8pJWTu.jpg)  [Arm Flexed](http://i.imgur.com/fT7mVQQ.png) [Pump]( http://i.imgur.com/JlXFjqX.png) ###Progress and Numbers I started this cut on January 4th for two reasons: (1) I had never cut before and wanted to see how I could push myself; and (2) I am a senior in college and for spring break we are heading to Punta Cana, and therefore I was all about the aesthetic look. Spring break was 9 weeks away so I did my research, and jumped right into a cutting regimen. My starting weight on January 4th was 199 pounds – stepping on the scale the first day was pretty shocking, I hadn’t weighed myself in a very long time and was shocked to see how high I had gotten. All that did was motivate me more to cut. 8 weeks later, my ending weight was 178 pounds. This was a loss of 21 pounds in 8 weeks, which comes out to roughly 2.6 pounds/week. While this probably resulted in a loss of muscle mass, I am content with the progress I made and retained a lot of my strength. Here are my lift numbers at the start and end: *Bench* * Start: 5x5 @225lbs * End 4x5 @225lbs *Squat* * Start: 5x5 @225lbs * End: 5x5 @225lbs *Deadlift* * Start: 5x5 @ 315lbs * End: 5x5 @315lbs *OHP* * 5x5 @135lbs * 5x5 @125lbs Here is a graph of my weight progress throughout the cut. [Weight Loss](http://i.imgur.com/mfxiRYs.png) ###Routine For the majority of these 8 weeks I followed a 4-day bro-split. This consisted of (1) Triceps and Chest, (2) Biceps and grip/forearm work, (3) Deadlifts and back, and (4) Squats and other leg stuff. After I did the four days, I would start back up at day 1 regardless of if there was a rest day in between. For the major lifts such as bench, squats, deadlift, ohp, etc. I followed a 5x5 set outline keeping the weight heavy and consistent, and attempted to keep the weight heavy for all other lifts to preserve my strength.  Starting in late January, I started adding structured cardio to my routine. I have always been active and have maintained a decent level of endurance from playing soccer, so I took to running as my source for cardio. I went with the C25k (Couch to 5k) Program and started a couple weeks in. This consisted of running 3x a week. Soon after being able to run a 5k, I moved on to a higher frequency of running and also distance ran. I am currently training for a 10k in 3 weeks. Here was a typical week late into the cut: *Monday* * Morning: Treadmill run for 45min, Core exercises for 30 min * Afternoon: 1 - Triceps and Chest  *Tuesday* * Morning: Cross training cardio for 45min, Core exercises for 30 min * Afternoon: 2 - Biceps and grip/forearm work *Wednesday* * Morning: Treadmill run for 45 min, Core exercises for 30 min * Afternoon: 3 - Deadlifts and back *Thursday* * Morning: Rest * Afternoon: 4 -Squats and other leg stuff *Friday* * Morning: Treadmill run for 45min, Core exercises for 30 min * Afternoon: Start back with 1 – Triceps and Chest *Saturday* * Morning: Treadmill run for 30 min, cross train 30 min, core exercises for 30 min * Afternoon: Rest *Sunday* * Morning: Rest * Afternoon: 2 – Biceps and grip/forearm work Here’s a graph of my total distance traveled per day throughout the cut, as well as a graph of my minimum and maximum heart rate throughout the cut. One thing I’d like to highlight is my average resting HR went from about 55 BPM to 45BPM, with a couple outlier days thrown in between. [Distance Traveled](http://i.imgur.com/GZ7xi4S.png) [Heart Rate](http://i.imgur.com/OqIdsId.png) ###Diet Once I set my caloric goal intake, I ate that much every day for the next 8 weeks. People have recommended tapering down your calories from what you’ve been eating down to your goal, but I found it was easiest to just go cold turkey and jump right into it. Based off of my TDEE and my time frame for weight loss, I set around a 1000 calorie deficit and set my daily intake at 1600 calories. This deficit would mean I lose around 2lbs per week, perhaps a little more once I started doing cardio. I set my macros at a 50/30/20 ratio for Protein/Carbs/Fat and actually stuck to this pretty strictly. It put me at around 200g of protein per day which is about 1.1g/lb. The only change I would make to this diet in hindsight is adding more fat, because I for sure did not get the recommended 0.4g/lb. This caused minimal temperament changes (I did get agitated easier while cutting) however it did decrease libido.  While I initially did not increase my consumption on days when I did cardio workouts in addition to lifting, once I was hitting 300+ kcal workouts I would normally add 200-300 calorie to my day to ensure I wasn’t losing too much weight too fast, and therefore losing muscle mass. Essentially took the equation that (GoalCalories = FoodIntake – Exercise) and made sure I was right at 1600 every day. However, since all calorie counting is an estimate, I normally would undershoot how much I expended. A typical meal plan would look like this: *Breakfast (450 Cals)* * Jimmy Dean Delight BFast Sandwich – 250  * Pure Protein Bar – 200  *Lunch (420 Cals)* * Premier Protein Shake – 160 * 2x Chicken Patty or Chicken Sausage – 260 *Dinner (730 Cals)* * 8 oz. Chicken Breast – 240 * 1.5 Cup Frozen Broccoli – 50 * Premier Protein Shake – 160 * Pure Protein Bar – 200 * Danon Light and Fit Greek Yogurt - 80 *Snacks on Cardio Days* * Bell Pepper – 50 * Canned Alaskan Salmon – 180 Here’s a graph of my active calories, resting calories, and total calories burned according to my Apple watch. This is not a reliable measurement however it does show some general trends throughout the cut.  [Calories Per Day](http://i.imgur.com/QiFCvbS.png) ###Supplements Aside from protein, amino acids, and preworkout, I had a daily regimen of vitamin supplements to ensure I was hitting all my micronutrient goals as well as just attempting to maintain a healthy body while eating at such a deficit. I can’t guarantee the efficacy of any of them, but if you have any questions about them feel free to ask. The supplements were: *Morning* * 1x Vitamin D3 5000IU * 1x Vitamin K 2700mcg * 1x Milk Thistle 250mg * 2x Burdock Root 430mg * 1x Airborne Chewable * 1x Fish Oil 1000mg *Evening* * 2x Orange Triad Multivitamin * 1x Fish Oil 1000mg * 1x Milk Thistle 250mg * 1x HMB 1000mg If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! ","You put in the time, effort, and discipline and got great results. Awesome progress man!",459
494tk1,"**Introduction** As I am typing this up, I have a feeling you are all in for a very long thread. So let me get that out of the way first. I will try to provide a structured and hopefully easy to read, wright up for the last 6 months of my life. With that out of the way lets get to the backstory.  **Backstory** I do not feel bad if you decide to skip this section. It's not really relevant in how the transformation happened but it is important for me and why it did.  Over 9 months ago I was started losing the battle to severe depression. It got to the point where I was unintentionally starving myself and every day just hoping something terrible would happen to me. Passive suicidal thoughts where rampant and motivation to even get out of bed was an incredibly hard mountain to climb. While I rather not go into the reason why I ended up here, I will say that it was by far the hardest time in my life. As time went on the negativity crept into not only myself and my self image, but everything I said or did. It tended to breed itself into a viscous monster that ate and bad things continued to happen. Or at least that is how it seemed. Anything good that was there I instantly snuffed out and choose to look at the ""reality"" of the situation. Then that is when I realized I hit rock bottom. I decided there was two options for me. Stay in this depressive self loathing state and wait for my ""bad luck"" to kill me, or stand up and fight it. So here is where it all started. I just hit my golden birthday in august and I choose to fight. I signed up for the gym that day and got myself a personal trainer later that week. That choice to have someone help me wasn't easy but I knew that without motivation and someone keeping me honest I would fail and be right back to where I was three months prior. He not only helped me with my physical training but also helped me mentally stabilize and see the good that was all around me. So out of everything, this thread is a dedication to the man that unknowing saved my life. (*addressed to my personal trainer*) If by some weird chance you happen to read this, thank you, thank you so much.  **WORKOUT CARDS** Every 3-4 weeks I would perform a new set of workouts. Rotating workouts has been instrumental to me having the success I have been seeing. By having the workouts and lifts mixed up every so often the muscles continued to see growth and progress. This is an example of my current workout card and lifting weights. I have had so many workout cards for me that to list them all would take me days. Most of the workout cards are similarly based. Also this is custom tailored to me and my personal goals. I would strongly advise if you are going to base a workout on something similar to this, know your own body and do your research. The last day for this week will have the previous weight i accomplished with a + signifying that if possible I will attempt to lift more next week.  **Lower body- Once a week** Rest | Exercise 4 sets | Date 1 | Date 2 | Date 3 ---|---|----|----|---- 2-3 min | Barbell Squat | 245 x6 | 245 x8 | 245+ x10 2-3 min | Leg Press  | 360 x 8 | 450 x 8 | 450+ x10 90 sec | weighted step ups | 30 x10 | 45 x12 | 45+ x15 60 sec | stability ball ham. curls | x10 | x12 | x15 45 sec | V-squat calf raises | 135 x10 | 135 x12 | 135+ x15 45 sec | Standing Calf Raises | 235 x 20 | 235 x25 | 235+ x30 **Chest - Twice a week**  Rest | Exercise 4 sets | Date 1 | Date 2 | Date3 ---|---|----|----|---- 90s | Incline Bench | 155 x6 | 155 x8 | 155+ x10 90s | Dips (chest focused) | x8 | x10 | x12+ 90s | Chest Fly w/ Hold | 70 x8 | 80 x10 | 80+ x12 60s | Bosu Ball push up | **T**ill **F**ail | TF | TF **Upper Body- Once a week** Rest | Exercise 4 sets| Date 1 | Date 2 | Date3 ---|---|----|----|---- 90s | Barbell deadlift | 225 x6 | 225 x8 | 225+ x10 90s | Pull up variations | TF | TF | TF 60s | Overhand row | 80 x8 | 100 x10 | 100+ x12 60s | DB single arm row | 55 x8 | 55 x10 | 55+ x12 45s | EZ bar curl | 75 x8 | 75 x10 | 75 x12 45s | TRX bicept curl | TF | TF | TF **Shoulders- Once a week** Rest | Exercise 4 sets| Date 1 | Date 2 | Date3 ---|---|----|----|---- 60s | Single Arm shoulder press | 60 x8e | 60 x10e | 60+ x12e 60s | Barbell Upright Row | 100 x8 | 100 x10 | 100+ x12 60s | Plate Front Raise w/ hold | 45 x8 | 45 x10 | 45+ x12+ 60s | Lateral Raises | 17.5 x20 | 17.5 x25 | 17.5+ x30 60s | Seated Bent over Lat Raises | 17.5 x20 | 17.5 x25 | 17.5+ x30 **CORE EVERYDAY-ALLDAY** This is just a circuit of several different types of planks, holds, and weighted crunches. Nothing particularly special about it. just fight through the pain.  **Cardio** Once a week I will do some intense cardio. Honestly back in high school I was a skinny cross country runner. So obviously my preference is running. But I HATE running on a treadmill. So I tend to make sure I mix up my cardio with either biking or running. At least 30 mins of activities on these days, but usually I will push myself to go for an hour or so. Distance and speed does not matter just so long as its an active nonstop pace.  **Nutrition** So as if the workouts where not intense enough the nutrition is actually the hardest part. (at least for me) Every day I have pushed, or have tried to push, myself to eat 3500 calories. To help keep me honest and make sure that my diet is on point I log everything through MyFitnessPal. The balance between Carbs, fats, and protein is divided 40%,30,30 respectively.  My diet usually consists of whole grain pasta dishes and lots of different types of meats. This has been the hardest part for me being a broke/ poor college student. Learning to budget and cook proper meals has been an insane challenge.  Supplements: Protein powder, Multi-vitamins, Fish oils and creatine. **RESULTS** Height: 5'10"". Now we get to my favorite part. Numerical results. Pictures can be deceiving and not only that, they don't tell the full story. But pure hard data in my opinion, is not only encouraging, but needed for proper growth. Measurements are in inches and in pounds. Measurements are taken about every two weeks or so while weight is recorded each week. Honestly I am surprised that the weight improvement is as consistent as it is.

It represents everything I believe in. C for Courtesy, I for Integrity, P for perseverance, SC for ~~Starcraft~~ Self Control, and IS for indomitable Spirit. Loosely based off of the Halo legendary icon with the iron skull (""death carries a heavy price""). It represents everyday is a new day to rebuild yourself into the man I want to be. This transformation has given me the confidence to do things I have never done in my life. It is contagious too, I have noticed that my friends around me even have started to go to the gym. I just recently have gotten a promotion at my job. So my luck wasn't bad, it just was a self fulfilling prophesy that I unknowing controlled.

49e66z,"In the study, two groups of experienced lifters did the same workout three times a week for eight weeks. It was a typical bodybuilding regimen: back squats, leg presses, leg extensions, bench presses, shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, and cable rows. Each workout, they did three sets of eight to twelve reps of each exercise, lifting to failure. The only difference between the two groups: One rested for one minute between sets, and the other rested for three minutes. After eight weeks, the researchers used ultrasound imaging to measure the lifters’ muscle growth. The men who had rested longer had more growth in all the muscles tested: the biceps, triceps, and quads. We’re not talking about monster gains: The longer-resting group grew an extra 1.2 to 3.5 millimeters in each muscle. But those millimeters come from such an easy tweak that few guys who are trying to bulk would turn them down. The researchers also tested the subjects’ strength gains by determining their one-rep max in the bench press and back squat. The longer resters won this contest, too. They increased their one-rep max for the squat by 15.2 percent and for the bench by 12.7 percent. That’s compared to the one-minute rest group, which increased its maxes by 7.6 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively. That’s big: If you can bench 180 pounds, a lifting regimen with longer rests could help you increase that to 203 pounds in eight weeks. Resting for only 1 minute between sets, on the other hand, could hold you back to only 187 pounds. Why the difference? The researchers think that a longer rest period allows you to recover more fully between sets, which may enable you to lift heavier weights in your next set, says lead study author Brad Schoenfeld, Ph.D. Those heavier weights put more tension on your muscles, which may lead to bigger gains in both strength and size. Consider working longer rests into your routine if you want to build strength and size, says Schoenfeld. This study only compared one-minute and three-minute rests, but other research suggests that two minutes may be enough to fully recover between sets, he says. Take those two-minute rests after your major compound exercises like squats, presses, and rows, which are more physically taxing and take longer to recover from. But you can stick to shorter, 60-second rests for single-joint movements like biceps curls, which you’ll bounce back from more quickly.

A typical day would look like this  Meal 1 - Home made protein bar Meal 2 - Tuna Protein Roll  Meal 3 - Fruit/salad smoothie with a scoop of protein  Meal 4 - Cous cous with tuna  Meal 5 - Beef curry with stir fried veg  http://i.imgur.com/4cdDieA.jpg  On other days when I haven't done 1000 calories worth of exercise like I had that day it would be more like  http://i.imgur.com/DklLbxs.jpg  Meal 1 - Home made protein bar  Meal 2 - Tuna protein roll  Meal 3 - Chilli con carne, stir fried veg and 6 eggs  I make a few meals up in advance, all can be done in a slow cooker, all super simple. Chilli, bolognese type sauce, curry, savoury mince etc. I then portion them up and freeze. That way when I come home after a hard day all i have to do is basically put my own version of a microwave meal in the microwave and prepare my fresh veggies to go with. On days when I can afford the extra calories I will sling a load of eggs in as well.  Its nothing out of the norm, just good, minimally processed whole foods to make everything and then conveniently portioned up.  ---- Exercise - Varied over the 18 months, started out with 5x5 and a bunch of walking now I destroy myself on the stairmill and lift upper lower split. ---- Specifics around routine.  First 6 months was the traditional 5x5 model  StrongLifts 5x5  Week 1  Monday - Squat 5x5, Bench 5x5, Barbell row 5x5 Wednesday - Squat 5x5, OHP 5x5, Deadlift 1x5  Friday - Squat 5x5, Bench 5x5, Barbell row 5x5  Week 2  Monday - Squat 5x5, OHP 5x5, Deadlift 1x5 Wednesday - Squat 5x5, Bench 5x5, Barbell row 5x5  Friday - Squat 5x5, OHP 5x5, Deadlift 1x5  I would also do 15 minutes of HIIT cardio after every lifting session and more often than not I would swim on the off days Tuesday and Thursday. However it was very gentle swimming more for stretching and recovery than additional cardio as such.   After the first 6 months I ran the same above but I adapted it a little and added in some accessories, curls and ab work mostly as they were the parts that seemed to be lacking.   Now I run something of my own design that I've slowly developed and tweaked over the last 4 months or so. Its a heavy workload but I've found it works for me so far, strength and mass is up and bodyfat has remained around the same. I've called it Strypertrophy LUCLU because its both strength and hypertrophy based on following the upper/lower protocol different days. I use my Wednesday for stretching and intense cardio. You'll notice the lack of deadlifts, I do do them on my second lower day fairly often, however I squat more so...  http://i.imgur.com/7qbQXti.jpg ---- As for me and my story the video is obviously above but further to that....  Crikey, where to start. In July 2014 I landed up in hospital with severe abdominal pains after vomiting some blood. My body, ravaged from alcoholism and drug addiction that got progressively worse over a 15 year period decided to push back. When I got into hospital my resting hr was rarely below 100, I weighed 120kg + and my cholesterol was measured at 21, yes 21, it should be less than 5. I would get out of breath just walking across the room. Hell I basically didn't leave my bed there in those last few weeks to do anything but visit the toilet and that was literally a huge challenge everyday. I was drinking upwards of 6000 calories a day and as many as 60-80 units and the weight and misery kept piling on.  I was broken, physically, mentally and spiritually broken. Lying in that hospital that night I realised that I didn't want to die, that no matter how bad a person I thought I was or how bad a person I thought I had been, nobody deserved to die on their knees. It was 2 days later after a rough couple of days detox before I could even face food but when I did I entered it into a popular fitness app for the first time. I had made the decision whilst lying there in fear of death for some time that I had to change and the best way I know to change is to get up and do something about it there and then, not next month, not next week, right now.   I left hospital a few days later practically detoxed from alcohol, I was still suffering some sweats and shakes occasionally but for all intents and purposes just being mindful over my food choices in those early days, in a hospital setting, had me feeling better.  It was strange really, I had come to a place in my life many times where I resolved to quit, I made grand promises and I really believed them. One more try though was always rapidly followed by one more failure. This time though something just felt different and I think it was because I really believed myself when I told myself I wanted to change. You see I would lie to myself all the time and everyone else for that matter. I was dishonest, cowardly, manipulative, malicious and vile on a daily basis and it was all for the stupidest of reasons, because I thought that was who I was supposed to be.  It’s been more than just the weight loss for me as you can probably tell. I have fundamentally changed as a person, I’ve found help from a local addiction service, a fellowship community and my self awareness has been dialled in. I try to treat everybody the best I can, not judge, be honest and remember where I came from everyday now and life is infinitely easier. Anxiety is down, self confidence is up.  So I was out of hospital, all set with my goal in mind of getting to 15% bodyfat and itching to go running or any number of things. However I had strict instructions from the doctors when leaving the hospital to take it slowly, I was told no more than 1 mile a day walking for at least a month to start with such was the physical trauma I’d put my body through it would have been ill advised to run before I could walk so to speak. So that’s what I did, I started out walking ramping it up week on week, towards the end of the month I was doing about 5 miles a day and hiked up a local landmark without pause something I couldn’t have done for at least 5 years prior when I attempted to get sober. 2 months in I did a 21 mile walk for meningitis.  After about 6 weeks I was down about 10kilos already. I joined a gym and started out using 5x5 on my phone, I had dipped in and out of weight rooms at times but never taken it seriously at all so I dropped all of my ego about the place and started with a beginner strength program. I felt getting the basics right before anything else was the way for me to go. I ran that for about 6 months in which time I got myself below 100 kilos for the first time in a little over ten years. The next 6 months I ran a variation of 5x5, just a few lifts added into the mix for all intents and purposes rather than anything radical. During these 6 months my weight began to fall off a lot slower, it seemed my body was pretty sweet with being around 97 kilos, even more so around 80kg when I hit that. I guess that change in pace was a hurdle for me. I was so used to seeing the weight come off in greater increments it shook me for a while, I started to doubt myself and my choices became sloppy again. Nevertheless I kept up my training throughout and when I haven’t lost weight I’ve seemed to gain muscle, sometimes I just stay the same and then one week it all seems to come at once.  These days I don’t monitor the scale so closely, I use it as a rough guide but the mirror and photos tell me more now. However I am aboute to strip right down to 10% or less and see just how bad my loose skin situation is going to be. Ultimately I am not finished, not by a long shot, I feel I will always seek to gradually improve every aspect of my being, this is who I am now, its who I always was deep down. My life now is infinitely improved, my resting heart rate is in the mid 40's, my cholesterol was 2 point something on the last check, my cardio health has improved dramatically, I'm stronger, faster than I have ever been and all my bloods have returned to safe ranges. The mental shift has probably been the bigger one though, I can hand on heart say I am trying every day to be a better man and I am eternally grateful to all those who helped me and ever more pleased to be able to give something back. I have a debt I owe for where I am today and I intend to repay it in full.  I guess to summarise its been more than the weight loss, I have fundamentally changed as a person and I no longer despise myself. The weight room has been a reminder for me that the more I put into anything the more I get out and that’s how I start my day. In the weight room pushing myself to the absolute limit because I tend to find whatever comes at me later in the day, after a hard workout its somehow more manageable.  If this video reaches even 1 other person trapped as I was then it will have served its primary purpose.","Inspirational bro, overcoming addiction like that is no easy feat. Big congratulations!",350
49ubxy,"Here’s the guide: [Don't Just Do It – A 5 Step Technique to Consistently Get in the Gym](http://routineexcellence.com/dont-just-do-it-a-5-step-technique-to-consistently-get-in-the-gym/) Hey everyone, The title pretty much says it. For a long time, consistency was the biggest problem I had with my workouts. I struggled because I would go all out for a couple of weeks, then get tired, quit, and have the same body I’d always had.  When I started studying psychology, both in college and on my own time, I realized that I could use what I was learning to help me work out more consistently. Since then, I’ve gained 40 pounds of lean muscle. Of course I eventually learned a lot more about training, but it all started with that consistency.  I wanted to write this guide to help anyone who’s struggling to make exercise a habit. It might also help people who have trouble getting their gym buddies to pony up and tag along.  The guide is split into two parts: * Part one covers the basic psychological tactics that you can use to make exercise a part of your daily routine – without relying on willpower * Part two puts those tactics together into a concrete plan. In 5 steps, you’ll come away knowing exactly how you can achieve your goals. Part one tactics include chaining (connecting your workouts to other events that you know will happen), precommitments (planning to work out well ahead of when you actually go to the gym), rewards (how to use small, consistent rewards instead of large ones), and barrier reduction (how to get rid of what stops you from working out).  Here's [a quick overview infographic](http://imgur.com/E5pPmva) of the 5 steps in part 2.  * In step one, you'll set a specific, actionable goal that lends itself to a clear and specific path of action.  * In step two you'll set subgoals, along with times to check in on your progress towards your ultimate destination * In step 3 you'll identify the specific problems that might stop you from achieving your ultimate goal * In step 4 you'll plan ahead, figuring out ways to address your specific roadblocks * Step 5 puts it all together. You'll come away with one piece of paper, your roadmap, that details exactly how you'll reach your destination     I hope you find this helpful!  Psychology has had a huge impact on my life, and I’m happy to answer as many questions as I know the answers to. ","You've got a lot of clever ideas here, and I've been struggling of late. I'm going to try applying (or re-applying) some of these and will keep you posted.",609

4ajtpp,"I posted [my progress pictures](http://i.imgur.com/WoOdCx9.jpg) on /r/Brogress yesterday, I got so many nice comments that I thought to write about this journey in more detail here.  ### Initial motivation  My starting weight was 62kg (137lbs) and height 185cm (6'1"") at 20 years old, I didn't grow taller but I grew my physique and the way I live. I always wanted to go to the gym, I browsed ~~4chan's /fit/~~ /r/fitness and /r/bodybuilding a lot but never really got around to it. There was a gym in my town but it was quite expensive €65 per month for 1 free weight area and a stupid [milon circle?](http://www.miloncirkel.com/).. ### Moving to England Almost 2 years ago, I moved to the UK (Swindon) and they had a 24 hour gym. I thought, no more excuses and let's go. Browsing reddit and other forums I decided to start with Stronglifts 5x5.  ### Stronglifts 5x5 This was a great workout to start with, I did it for 3 months straight, never missing a single workout and gained a lot, the beginning is always fast. In those 3 months I went from 62kg (137lbs) to 70kg (155lbs). I got my bench up to 60kg, deadlift 120kg, row 70kg and OHP 45kg. I was **over the moon**, I felt stronger, shirts started to fit tighter and people started to notice slightly *Diet*: My diet at that time consisted of.. eating a ton of food and whole milk (GOMAD). I didn't count calories (still don't) but I always checked what pasta had the most calories, what meat etc. That and the additional 2000kcal I got from drinking 2.5L whole milk a day had me gaining a lot of weight. I stopped doing GOMAD after my skin started to get bad (a lot of pimples) and I had to go to the toilet about every hour.  ### PHUL  After feeling *fairly* strong and done with Stronglifts, I started [PHUL](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout). 4 days a week. I did this for about 3 months and again, saw some nice gains. Switching up routines has worked really well for me. After ~3 months I just don't get sore anymore, so I change workouts and then I do. I did this workout up until like 76kg (167lbs). *Diet:* During these 3 months, I again, ate as much as possible. I was completely done with the milk but started taking weight gainer shakes. I bought the [Optimum Nutrition](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/sm.html) one and took one before bed, every night. ### PHAT After not getting sore anymore from PHUL, I started [PHAT](http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html). 5 days a week, training hard. I did this for about 4 months and saw decent results. I got up to 80kg (176lbs), my goal weight. You know what happens once you reach your goal? You feel great, but you want more (or at least I do). So the current goal then was (and still is now) 90kg (200lbs). *Diet:* Nothing special, still kept up the weight gainer shakes every night and just ate **a lot**.  ### Moving back to the Netherlands My year in England was done, I wanted to move back. It was as if the god Brodin himself wanted me to keep getting gains because in my tiny town, there suddenly was a brand new, shiny **24h** gym. This couldn't be a coincidence. ### 6 day PPL split I started with 3 days a week, went up to 4 days a week, moved to 5 days a week so now the most logical next step to me was to go 6 days a week. So I did with this [6 day PPL split](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/6-day-powerbuilding-split-meal-plan). I had been lifting for almost a year now and people told me I looked like I lift.. **Achievement Unlocked** -> Not looking DYEL anymore, finally. So I did this 6 days a week, again never skipping a workout and religiously going, looking forward to every day.  **Diet:** Same old, just eat a lot. I moved back with my parents so I don't decide what's for dinner anymore... I got tired of the weight gainer shakes so I found something even better. ""quark"" with wallnuts.  I can't find the direct English word for it but it looks like [this](https://www.boodschappenboer.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Almhof-Volle-Kwark-Spaanse-Sinaasappel-500g1.jpg), it's like really thick yoghurt. One 500ml cup with wallnuts contains about 1050kcal and again, I took one before bed, every night.  ### Lazar Angelov's workout + Running I started this workout a month ago, when I was 83kg (182lbs) and I am at the time of writing, 85.5kg (189lbs). [This workout](http://www.gymaholic.co/articles/fitness/19/lazar-angelov-workout-and-diet) is a lot of fun and has muscle group days rather than pull / push days. Which is nice after ~10 months doing PPL. Before starting this workout I took a week off lifting because I had been lifting non stop. I hated not lifting and not going to the gym. Every hour I was thinking about the weights, looking at /r/bodybuilding, images of Steve Cook and Calum von Moger.. After that week I started the workout and man, I got super sore (again)!  **Running**: So my new job was on the 4th floor, I take the elevator every day because Dom told me cardio kills gainz. I took the stairs ""for fun"" once and noticed my endurance sucked big time. Since Lazar's workout is 5 days a week, I got 2 rest days. That's 1 too much so I started running. Just 5-8km every Sunday.  **Diet:** Same as with the PPL split, living the quark and wallnuts still.  ___  ### Supplements I took protein shakes, BCAAs, ZMA, whatever. None of them longer than 2 weeks because I just didn't dig the shakes. The only supplements I have taken daily and will continue to do so are: * Creatine (3g) * Multivitamin * Fish Oil I feel like that's all I need, 5 pills when I wake up (multi + fish oil) and 1 scoop of creatine before I go to bed. ### Sleep 8 hours a night, every night. I know and feel sleep is important. My new job requires me to get up at 05:45. This is why I am in bed 21:45 Sunday to Thursday. I religiously sleep 8 hours at least and about 8.5-9 in the weekend.  ### No alcohol This is an overstatement, I sure drank some pints in England with my colleagues but only 1 night a week. If I drank Friday, I didn't drink on Saturday and vice-versa. I barely drink **any** alcohol nowadays as it just doesn't taste as good anymore. I used to love drinking beer with my friends but now I just drink water, only water. ___  ### Conclusion Starting to lift has been the best decision in my life. I was always that skinny kid with red hair. I was scared of confrontation and I just felt weak. Now 1.5 years later people tell me I'm ""getting big"" and ""starting to look like a closet"" (that probably sounds cooler in Dutch). Someone in that /r/brogress thread told me I inspired him (or her). That was really cool to hear. I hope to inspire more people and that's why I wrote this long ass post.  EDIT: I don't know why my post got locked but I didn't do it. Thanks for the nice PMs everyone and yes I like this manbun for now, I'm not going to cut it off because a few internet strangers tell me to haha! EDIT2:  Some of you have asked my Instagram / Snapchat, it's the same as my reddit username but I don't post a lot. Just the occasional gym selfie..

4aozzf,"Starting February 1, I began my “Rock’ing for 30 Days” challenge to eat and train like Dwayne Johnson for 30 days. As it ended on a Tuesday, I finished out the week, completing a total of 33 days of the challenge. Three weeks ago, [I shared all the details about the eating and workout plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/46fxfr/im_eating_and_training_like_dwayne_the_rock/), so I won’t repeat it here. **TL;DR SUMMARY** After eating 5300 calories a day for 33 days, more than 23 hours of cardio, and almost 80lbs of cod!, I gained a total of 1lb. After over 28 hours of weight training, I got leaner and gained some muscle in my upper arms (most triceps), upper legs (mostly quads), my upper chest (you can see it pulled my chest up). Here are the [before and after photos](http://imgur.com/a/BxKRy).  **THE ROCK’S RESPONSES** I blogged every day during this month and a few articles got written about the challenge. They came to the attention of The Rock, who had a few things to say on Twitter about it. He doubted me at first, but then came around. [Here are screengrabs of The Rock’s tweets](http://imgur.com/a/Mt6uG).  **LIFTING RESULTS** I got stronger, though I hadn’t done much isolated lifting in years, so definitely a lot of beginner gains here. I probably increased weights around 10-15% or so. Just to pick two random exercises for an example:  In the beginning of the month, I started the incline bench at around 115lbs (4x12/10/8/6), and now it starts at 150lbs. I was originally doing the 200 reps of leg press at 160-180lbs, now it’s at 220-240lbs.  One change to the workout: in week 3, the lack of ab work became quite apparent, so I added 3 ab exercises: leg raises, russian twist, and stir the pot. More details are shown in the Google doc below. **SO NO WEIGHT GAIN?** Apparently not. I didn’t skip a single meal, ate every bite, and had nothing else besides this food the entire time. I thought I would put on a few pounds, so getting leaner was a surprise. I had never really subscribed to a pure “calories in, calories out” belief, and this experience killed it for me. It’s more than how much you eat, what you eat makes a huge difference. [Here’s a photo gallery showing meal prep](http://imgur.com/a/bjcLT). **HOW I FELT ALL MONTH** Terrific. Even with so much food, I never felt overly full. Every morning I would do 50 mins of cardio, then eat 10oz of cod, 2 cups of oatmeal, and 2 hard boiled eggs (at the gym!) then weight train. I always used to work out on a mostly empty stomach (just a shake) so I thought this would make me nauseous, but it felt good. Even with all the workouts, I never felt sore. All the food seemed to be fueling my recovery. Even the little aches and pains of being in your late 30’s went away. I also was serious about stretching/foam-rolling at the end of the workouts, so I didn’t feel very tight either. **WAS IT WORTH IT?** I decided to do this as a challenge to myself, to see if I had to discipline to wake up at 5am everyday, do all these workouts, prepare all this food in advance, eat every meal, have no cheating, and live my normal life. I have no aspirations to get huge like The Rock, and 30 days wouldn’t do it anyway. Overall, it was an extremely positive experience, and I highly encourage everyone to push themselves to try something new for a month. If I had to do it over, the only change would be to take a ton of measurements, pictures, body scans, blood tests, etc beforehand. Would have been nice to quantify it more. There seems to have been a nice change in my body fat %, would have been great to have those numbers (anyone want to make estimates?). Would I suggest this plan to others? If you’re chasing the physical results, you’re almost certainly better off putting together a routine and meal plan specifically for you. It’s also extremely expensive, at $42/day. While cod is an excellent source of low calorie, low fat protein, that benefit doesn’t outweigh the cost of, say, chicken breast. **WHAT IS WORTH INCORPORATING?** You could probably eat more, as long as it’s the right foods. Experiment with increasing your protein and overall calories with good, clean food, and see what happens. This is personal preference, but I liked doing cardio first, then weights, which I had never done. It’s a good warmup, and it’s nice to be done for the day after you lift that last weight. Mastering efficient food prep is key. Not having to decide what you’re eating at every meal is a pleasure, and not having to cook it. And with practice, you get a ton of return on your time investment. I can make 18 meals in about an hour now. I’ll keep prepping food every few days. I have eaten mostly keto for years, but man, oatmeal is delicious. Starting every day with it moving forward. **WHAT’S NEXT** I want to follow a more sustainable version of this program for longer, starting with another 30 days. So far, I’m doing the same workouts 5x a week. I changed up the diet to have 5 meals, no cod, and comes in at 3579cal/451C/59F/294P. So far, I have noticed I’m getting a bit sore now, in a way I wasn’t before, so I’m going to keep experimenting here to come up with a better version.  If there is interest in me sharing that diet, or putting up an update post after following a tweaked plan for 30 days, let me know. Or if anyone wants more detail on any specific piece of this, let me know. **DOCUMENTS TO SHARE** In case anyone wants to try any of this, here is the [full meal plan and workout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h7TpQ4tM98jihx2gUrFWRH4EtOucPTiFfmPU1-hnA4A/edit?usp=sharing) in a handy Google doc (I have this saved to my phone and followed it at the gym), Also, here are the [food costs, nutritional info, and a data dump from my Fitbit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FefRW39jUk3TmwWE6brxiSp6cbvQ-yEjD2Cf1G43F24/edit?usp=sharing). Questions, thoughts? Hit me. ","Such an elephant in the room with the Rock. It's not possible to gain lbs a month of muscle by eating and weight training alone.

4ata5a,"The super helpful, and all around awesome and stronk Greg Nuckols (/u/gnuckols) has just released the longest, most in-depth article on the squat... completely free! Here it is: [How to Squat: The Definitive Guide • Strengtheory](http://strengtheory.com/how-to-squat/) It is definitely long, but definitely worth a read for lifters of all skill levels.   Thank you beardsmith! Edit: per rule 2, some elaboration on the article, written by Greg himself:  The squat is the exercise at the core of most peoples' lower body training. A recent guide (http://strengtheory.com/how-to-squat/) breaks down the squat in depth, to help you optimize your squat technique and maximize your your training based on your goals, strengths and weaknesses. The abbreviated takeaways: 1) a lot of factors that people spend a lot of time obsessing about such as bar position, stance width, and footwear don't matter too much in a general sense. They may be more or less appropriate for someone based on their goals, but the overall training effect they provide is very very similar. 2) most people whose squats wind up looking like good mornings need to work on strengthening their quads, most people who have a big gap between the squat and deadlift (larger than 15-20%) need to work on bracing for the squat, and most people without either of the other problems need to strengthen their hip extensors. 3) deep squats are safe for people without pre-existing knee, back, or hip injuries 4) people should squat in a manner in line with their goals. In general, low bar squats are likely best for building hip strength, high bar squats are likely best for building quad strength, and front squats are likely best for building upper back strength, though the head-to-toe training effects are very similar. The guide goes into a lot more depth, and seeks to answer most of the common questions people have about squatting.

4c7ha6,"Here’s the guide: [How to Choose a Beginner Weight Training Program That You’ll Stick To](http://routineexcellence.com/how-to-choose-a-beginner-weight-training-program-that-youll-stick-to/) EDIT: I see concern over the term ""weightlifting"" coming up in the comments. Unfortunately I think I just missed the spacebar – this guide isn't about Olympic lifting, and I'm sorry for any confusion.  A couple of weeks ago I wrote [a guide on consistently going to the gym](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/49ubxy/i_made_a_guide_to_help_you_stop_being_lazy_and/) that had a pretty awesome response. As part of that response, I had a lot of people ask me about what programs they should start out on. A few people asked in the comments section as well.  Now, the /r/fitness wiki has a ton of super useful info, but there are often still posts asking for beginner routines. I think the wiki is a great resource, but it can also be tough to pick a program when you’re faced with so many options.  To be clear, I think the most effective program is the one you can stick to. Still, it can be nice to have more information to work with. With that in mind, I wrote another guide (sorry, this one is also long), this time on what you should be looking for in a beginner program. It covers the aspects of a program that help you be consistent, the aspects of a program that get you results, and the types of exercises that a good program includes.  **Part 1** covers the aspects of a program that help you be consistent: * **Time:** How long does your program take? * **Complexity:** How confusing is your program? * **Progression:** Can you see yourself making progress? * **Punishment:** How do you feel after a workout? * **Credibility:** Do you believe that your program will get results? Reducing time commitments, complexity, and punishment while increasing progression and credibility make you more likely to stick to a program.  **Part 2** covers the aspects of a program that get you results: 1. A focus on compound exercises 1. Built-in progressive overload Any effective intro program is going to emphasize gradually adding weight to compound exercises. **Part 3** covers the main exercise movements that a good program includes: * **Hinge:** Movements that involve bending the hip without much bending of the knees * **Squat:** Movements that involve bending the hip and the knees * **Push:** Movements that push things away from you or push you away from things * **Pull:** Movements that pull things towards you or pull you towards things The programs in the wiki typically have these, but in my experience a lot of beginners sub out exercises that they don’t like. Hopefully understanding exercise categories can reduce that, or at least help pick better exercise substitutions.  After that I talk a little bit about unilateral exercises and warm-ups.  My guess is that people here will have more opinions about this than they did about my last post.  What do you think makes an introductory program effective? ",You missed out the most overlooked underated and talked form of progressive overload. Do more reps with the same weight. 100kgx5 -> 100kgx6 is progress and is fundamental when linear gains run out/intermediate programs have to be used,204

4ct88b,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4c7rpr/my_epic_fat_loss_transformation_obese_to_ripped/) Note: I had a solid muscular base under my fat and a history of weight lifting, this is why it looks like I gained a lot of muscle... I didn't gain as much as you might think, I mostly made what I had more visible.  [Before & After Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/MjkXl) [Here is a picture](http://imgur.com/w0hVy9w) of how jacked I already was my senior year of HS before I gained weight to prove that I had a solid muscular base and really didn't gain much muscle.  **The Spring Break Trip:** Roughly one year ago, I was invited to a spring break trip to Panama City Beach, FL. I had a great time... BUT... I felt held back... I really started to see just how bad my lack of confidence was; I wanted to take my shirt off and enjoy the sun, but I really didn't want people to see how I looked. Coincidentally, during the trip, I found [this article](http://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/) by /u/zbyhnev/ which outlined the difference between motivation and discipline.  The article mentioned:  > This is one of these situations where adopting a different perspective immediately results in superior outcomes.  It really was. Immediately when I got back, I told myself that I was going to lose weight and get ripped for my next spring break trip. I didn’t care what it took. I wanted it so I was going to have it. **The Plan:** I knew the basic idea behind losing weight was to eat less than you could consume, so I went off of that idea. I looked up a weight loss calculator on google and stumbled upon [this one](https://www.fitwatch.com/calculator/weight-loss-target-date). I plugged in my stats to lose two pounds a week and got my caloric target: 1880. **The Beginning:** In the beginning, I really didn’t workout or anything, I just tracked my calories. At some point I started using [myfitnesspal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) to track my calories but I did it on paper to start off. I ate what I was used to eating, just less. I ate portioned out tuna casseroles, bagels with cream cheese, noodles with pasta sauce and a whole bunch of other typical ""American"" food. I lost a decent bit of fat just by doing that and I felt great because I was gaining solid momentum. At a certain point, I made a bet on a site called [healthywage](https://www.healthywage.com/) which pays you to lose weight. I knew confidently that I was going to follow through so it was a no-brainer. Needless to say, I doubled my money. **Gaining Momentum:** While losing weight, I did lots of research and learned a lot. I read a lot of articles and watched a lot of fitness YouTubers. I think it's important to be a sponge for information. Learning while going through the process was crucial in getting the results I attained. I was learning about re-feed days, strict body-building diets, supplementing creatine, advanced calorie counting techniques and weighing food on a scale before I did any of those things. A couple of months into my journey, I finally joined the gym.  **Hitting the Gym:** (Note: I lifted before I got fat so I had some sense in what I was doing when I started) YouTubers I liked at the time were the [Buff Dudes](https://www.youtube.com/user/buffdudes) so I modeled my workouts after their [3-day split routine](http://www.buffdudes.net/2014/04/3-day-workout-split-routine.html). Later, I read about the concepts behind the [Strong Lifts 5x5 program](http://stronglifts.com/) and combined that with the concept of a three day split. Here's the kicker: I didn't really have a set list of exercises that I would do in a certain order when I went to the gym, I would always wing it... These are the only rules I really followed when entering the gym: * Get around 5 reps on most compound exercises * Focus only on the particular body parts for the given day. (Chest+Triceps, Back+Biceps, Legs+Shoulders) * Focus most of my effort on compound exercises For chest+tricep days, I would do flat dumbbell chest presses and the good ol' fashioned bench press for many sets of 5 reps. Sometimes I would do things like incline barbell presses and incline dumbbell presses, etc. As soon as I noticed I was repeating the same routine multiple times, I switched it up. I would change the ordering of each exercise, the number of sets, the amount of weight along with shorter/longer rest periods, incorporation of drop sets, etc. There was one day where all I did was bench press for 20 sets and kept dropping the weight until 135 became unbearable. I feel that it is too easy to get bored with the same routine so I mixed it up. I enjoy the process of choosing what to do in the moment given what equipment is available and what I'm feeling. Needless to say, I confused the hell out of muscles doing this. (Which is a good thing!) I got addicted to going to the gym. I loved feeling the pump where my muscles would fill with blood, feel tight and look huge. Since I was cutting for a while though, I gained very little strength which was slightly discouraging. However, there was a point in time where I started to supplement with creatine (5g daily) and felt like a gym god in about 2-3 weeks. My deadlift went from 275 to 315 and I remember being so happy when I finally pulled 3 plates. I'll also add that I did some running on the treadmill about 2 times a week for 15-20 minutes after my lifting sessions. As you can see, extreme cardio was not a significant part of my weight loss. A caloric deficit with some weight-lifting and persistence was the key. **Improving my Diet:** As I kept reading and watching YouTube videos, I learned better ways to eat and prepare food. First of all, I only drank water, plain tea or black coffee (drinking only water/coffee/tea was never a problem for me but I know it is for others so I thought I'd mention it). I learned techniques for preparing my meals ahead of time and routinely eating those (/r/mealprepsunday). I planned the meals to be anywhere from 500-700 calories. They tended to consist of a lean meat, a filling carbohydrate and steamed vegetables. I also ate plain oatmeal for breakfast with some chopped up fruit and/or peanutbutter and cinnamon. I also drank fruit smoothies and prepared overnight oats. By now, I had purchased a food scale and a body fat caliper to chart changes in my body fat percentage and measure my calories with greater precision. I started eating very clean. I did have days where I would have slices of pizza and other junk, but I stuck with my diet 99% of the time. Proteins: Chicken Breast, Turkey, Fish Carbohydrates: Brown rice, Quinoa, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes Vegetables: Broccoli, Carrots, Cauliflower, Green Beans **Getting Ripped:** Losing fat became very hard at the end. My fat loss started to plateau. My goal was to get to 10% body fat and at the time I had around 14-15%. Previously, I had read about re-feed days and diet breaks and decided to give these techniques a try. I figured my body needed it considering that I had been at a caloric deficit for many months. The 14-day diet break I had was amazing. Energy levels went through the roof which translated to slightly better lifts in the gym. After the break was over, I lost a couple more pounds of fat a little bit easier. With the iconic spring break trip soon approaching, I had to lose another 5 pounds in about 6 weeks. I slightly lowered my calories from around 2000 to 1800 and continued to hit the gym 3 days a week with occasional cardio. It was very difficult. I had ridiculous cravings. RIDICULOUS. I started obsessing about the next time I was going to eat and my roommate had to deal with my shitty mood swings. I had about two planned re-feed days within that 6 week period and those were the days I looked forward too. In the end, it came down to discipline in not eating and sticking to my plan regardless of how I felt.  **Conclusion:** The day before spring break, I had a new average weigh-in: 175lb on the dot. **TL;DR** I was fat and didn't like it. learned discipline > motivation. Started calorie counting. Started hitting the gym and lifting weights with a caloric deficit. Started eating cleaner. Got hard near the end so I incorporated diet breaks and re-feeds. Fought huge cravings and eventually hit 10% body fat.

4d07m9,"I've struggled with my weight my entire life. I was overweight from when I was about 8-14 years old, until I decided to sporadically crash diet all throughout high school, my lowest weight reaching 125lb (I'm 5'9""). During my high school years, I rarely exercised. I was constantly gaining and losing weight. Finally, after high school, I decided to make a lifestyle change. With the help of my boyfriend who had already been lifting for 4+ years at the time, I made the transition from no exercise to weight lifting. It has been a little over 2 years since I've decided to make this lifestyle change, and I could not be happier with how I feel about myself. I go to the gym and lift weights 5-6 times per week, and work in at least 3-4 15 minute sessions of HITT on the stairmaster in addition to the weights. I also started counting my macros about 2 months ago. I now weigh around 140-145lb. I'm on ""cutting"" macros right now, and hope to lose maybe 5-7 more pounds, but for now I am so happy with the progress I have made!  https://m.imgur.com/a/wcBBm INFO: Sex: female Age: 21 Height: 5'9"" Weight: 140-145 Weight lifting Routine: I lift as heavy as I can 5-6 days a week. Most recently I have been trying to squeeze in 2-3 leg days a week since that is what I have been trying to improve on the most. For leg days I will do a variation of about 5 of these exercises: leg press, squats, deadlifts, straight leg deadlifts, smith machine lunges, hamstring curls, single leg press, calf raises.  The other days I'll work upper body, and I've been splitting it between arms and shoulders and chest and back. Again for these I do the basics: bicep curls, tricep pulldowns, bench press, lat pulldowns. Nothing too out of the ordinary.  Cardio routine: I try to do cardio the days I don't work legs at the gym, because obviously my legs are too dead after to get on the stairmaster. But on the stairs I do 15 minutes of 30 second intervals, alternating between level 18 and level 1. It has taken me a long time to build up to this, and whenever it gets ""easier"" I will bump it up a level.  Caloric intake: I eat anywhere around 1500-1600 calories a day, and am following a macro diet. I try to eat as many whole foods as I can, but I do eat processed things here and there. I also eat some form of protein with every meal. Once a week cheat meal including dessert.  ***to clarify: the overweight picture is the shower picture. Not the cruise picture. The cruise picture is just when I decided to start my fitness journey. I was not overweight by any means there, just unhealthy from lack of exercise and a poor diet.

A large focus on compound movements for all my lifts (although lately Ive moved towards lower weight higher rep). I have a deadlift, squat, ohp and bench day. I generally follow 5/3/1 and try and throw in complementary compounds when I can (like front squats or close grip bench press). Accessory stuff I've been having fun with lately. Rows, flys, curls, hammer curls, chin ups, shrugs. I try a lot of different things and shoot for 3x10-15.  As long as I get a good compound lift in, I'm happy, and the rest is for fun.  With my huge reset I'm hitting reps in the 10-15 range now.  ------------------- For food, I'm tracking every single piece of food I eat in Myfitnesspal.  I generally keep my macros to .8g protein per lb, 1g carb per lb, and round out the rest in fat (usually around 60-70g total).  I stick to basics like fish, chicken, rice, oatmeal, eggs, olive oil, peanut butter, etc but I'm not afraid to go iifym if I want some junk food, I just don't make it a habit. I don't have set cheat meals or days, I don't like getting caught up in that mentality.  Bottom line is its calories in, calories out for me, with a focus on macros. ",Great hair gains!,1461

4e6435,"I know there's a lot of new people here who are just getting started with exercise, and I wrote something that might be useful. It's what I misunderstood about exercise when I was fat. The article is rather long, and I don't want to just dump a link on /r/fitness and leave, so I'll summarize it below: **TL;DR:** I used to believe exercise is something that exists primarily for weight management--a sort of drudgerous, self-flagellation that you just have to endure for your health and wellness. I tried multiple times to ""work out"" and lose the eighty pounds that I gained beginning in college, but I always stopped. It wasn't until years later that I realized I'd had it all wrong. Cycling taught me that exercise can be fun. *Joyful*. A form of play, as the late Dr. George Sheehan often said. I've since come to feel similarly about running; it's a form of liberation, and it's an essential part of my life.  [Here's the link if you're interested.](http://frankbeard.org/2016/04/09/what-i-misunderstood-about-exercise-when-i-was-fat/) ","That is so true (you have a way with words OP), the self flagellation part too. Oddly enough weightlifting, powerlifting and hiking are my absolute favorite pastimes now. I liked them before but it did feel like i was working out because im overweight, now i do so because im passionate about it",431
4ejrpc,I run about 5-7 miles once a week for cardio along with a lifting plan and now I'm thinking about getting really getting into running for weight loss. I use zombie run with music or listen to podcasts and still running is just....painful.  My cousin who's a cross country kid says that after a while it just feels like walking. Is this true for everyone? And when does it happen? Edit: wow I got a lot of answers. Thank you everyone who commented. Now I just got to read all of these UPDATE: Thank you for all the answers. It seems that the general consensus is that it depends on your body and if you do it correctly. Now I can't wait for my next run. ,nope,4049
4extwb,"Back in January I was tired of feeling sluggish, tired of drinking beer, and generally just tired of being out of shape. I ate like a dumpster with a mouth and didn't exercise outside of my sometimes-physical job. So I decided combine a daily run with a low-carb, high fat diet to lose weight and get healthier. Unfortunately I didn't weigh myself before, but I did take pictures on the day I decided to do all this:  **Front Comparison Pic** http://imgur.com/LIcuWcX **Side Comparison Pic** http://imgur.com/wu9IUB0 As of today I weigh 170lbs. If I had to guess, I'd say I weighed somewhere between 190-210lbs back in January.  **Diet** Consisted of low-carb, high fat food with the intention to keep my carb intake below 50g a day (usually I only hit 30g). I ate a lot of meat, salads, low sugar Greek yogurt, and wraps made with low-carb tortillas. I had done a diet like this before and have basically stuck with those three meals for the last three months. I did have a few cheat days here and there, but made sure to run on those days too.  **Exercise** I have a NordicTrack treadmill that peaks at 12mph and, I think, 12% incline. I exclusively used the Aerobic Fitness presets which ranged from a max of 6.5mph and 10 percent incline. My usual walk/run is a 30 minute program that peaks at 4mph and 10% incline which comes out to around 1.7 miles. I do that twice, so I have been running 3 miles or more a day since January 6th. Sometimes I get a little crazy and go for the 6.5mph max preset, which makes me feel completely wiped out for the rest of the day. That one is 2.4 miles and I hope to eventually do two of those each morning without feeling it as hard.  **Observations** So besides the obvious one of my formerly-enormous gut shrinking, I have insane energy and endurance now compared to back in January. I look forward to running and I feel great at work afterwords (unless I do that dreaded 6.5mph max preset). Running is something that I can see myself doing way beyond these first 100 days.

4fc8ta,"Here’s the post: [It's Not Because You're Hungry – 14 Ways to Control Your Eating](http://routineexcellence.com/its-not-because-youre-hungry-14-ways-to-control-your-eating/) Hey /r/Fitness, This is the third (and possibly final) guide I’ve written for you guys. After the first two on [consistently going to the gym](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/49ubxy/i_made_a_guide_to_help_you_stop_being_lazy_and/) and [choosing a beginner weight training program](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4c7ha6/i_wrote_a_guide_to_help_you_choose_a_beginner/), I had dozens of requests for a guide on the psychology of eating and sticking to a consistent diet.  **So, here it is.** When most people are asked why they eat, the answer is simple: “hunger.” We definitely do eat because we’re hungry, but there are a million other factors that can cause us to eat more (or less) without realizing. Who we're with, where we are, what time it is, what we're eating off of, and where the food is all have a major impact on our eating habits.  By understanding the things that make us eat, we can adjust our lifestyles to effortlessly eat more or less.  ***One thing to note:*** I know /r/fitness loves counting calories. I agree that counting calories is effective and will work, but I also think that it can be tedious and overwhelming, especially for someone that is simultaneously trying to start an exercise habit. Changing too much at once can be a recipe for disaster.  I personally don’t count calories (I have, didn’t like it much), and the advice in this guide is not geared towards calorie counting. That said, it will still be helpful to those that do count calories. Understanding why you’re tempted to snack can help you resist (or encourage!) snacking and more easily hit your macros.  The guide is split into two parts: ***Part One*** covers the common elements of our environment that cause us to over or undereat. You’ll learn why you don’t just eat when you’re hungry, and begin to identify the deeply ingrained food habits that govern your behavior. ***Part Two*** tackles the most common eating struggles we face as mindless eaters. You’ll learn how to control portion size, how to control snacking, how to eat out less, and what to do when you eat out.   In part one, we’ll discuss some common elements of our environment that contribute to eating. Namely:  * Social eating * Time-based eating * Clean-plate eating * Dish size * Accessibility of food In part two, I provide 14 ways to manage the 3 major aspects of eating: Portion size, snacking, and eating out.  Portion size:  1. Use smaller dishes/utensils 1. Keep serving dishes away from the table 1. Get a new plate for each serving 1. Slow down 1. Be mindful (sometimes) Snacking: 1. Hide your snacks 1. Never eat from the bag 1. Use a cookie counter 1. Swap, don’t stop 1. Understand your snacking Eating out: 1. Meal prep 1. Get better at cooking 1. Track the cost of eating out 1. Portion control You’ll notice that most of these tips seem geared towards people trying to lose weight. In each I also give tips for those trying to gain, but the tips are basically the same: do the opposite of the tactics you would use to lose weight.  This is the last mega-guide I’ll post here for quite a while (I’ll still be posting other stuff on my site), so I hope you find it useful. Let me know what you think!  ",What's a cookie counter...

My diet consisted of alcohol and fast food mostly. I was in weights class and slowly began to just eat everything in sight, and lift heavy with a low range rep of around 5-7 and avoid cardio at all costs. I would eat an entire Digiorno meat lovers pizza everyday for the protein and drink mutant mass at night. I had no idea of what a good balanced diet was.  that soon turned me into this [monster!](http://imgur.com/qy5WPw0) I was lifting very heavy but with no rhyme or consistency and I ended somewhere around 200 pounds. [worst shape in my life!](http://imgur.com/ErVLxy4) Now starts my cut which started this year I got complete control over my diet (well mostly) For the past 20 weeks I'v simply been aiming for close to 2000 calories  I have stayed at around 2000 calories through this entire 20 weeks the only thing I've dropped is the amount of fats  As far as routine I started doing fasted cardio at least twice a week and cardio of any form at least 4 times a week.  250G+ protein, very low fat usually between 50-30G of fat. The rest of my calories where all from carbs. I'm not quite sure on the exact number if I'm honest, I got most of my success through consistently eating clean and reaching a higher protein, low fat, moderate to high carb diet. Here is a basic meal plan for the day for me meal 1. 12 egg whites+spinach and ezekiel bread and pb2 or ezekiel cereal meal 2. isopure shake and natural cereal bar plus some fruit meal 3. half pound of lean beef and mushrooms  meal 4. salmon(or more beef and mushrooms) and sweet potato fries Before the gym  meal 5. 12 egg whites+spinach and any high GI carb after the gym  meal 6. protein shake and cereal bar.

4fqwib,"Last year I lost 185 pounds in about 7 months on a doctor assisted diet. I had to go off the diet early because my job was very physical and I started getting light headed daily. Over the following 7 months I rebuilt in preparation to get back on the diet.  I'm male, 36, 6'5"", and started at 445 in December 2014. My weightloss milestone was 260 in June 2015. My rebuild put me at 275 in February 2016. **Weight Loss Diet:**  - 130 calorie shakes (Rapid Fat Burning Program and First Step are the ones I was prescribed).  - Normal people are supposed to do 5 per day, I was at 6 shakes or ~800 cal per day.  - By the end I had been upped to 8 shakes and coconut water (~1200 cal per day) due to work. **Exercise:** - Work (8 miles of walking 3-5x per week) - 1 hour of cardio 3x per week - 30 minutes of weights 3x per week.  I lost about 6 pounds per week on average, but my strength went down progressively as the diet went on. About 40 pounds of the loss had been muscle. Within 2 weeks of going back to solids and starting my maintenance diet, 10 pounds of water weight came back putting me at 270, and I began rebuilding my lost muscle. My weight did not change much, instead my muscle mass just sort of shifted. I lost some on my legs since I wasn't carrying 445 anymore, and regained some on my upper body. **Maintenance Diet:**  - Bought a scale and weighed EVERYTHING. - MyFitnessPal is absolutely key. - 2500 calories and aimed for mid-to-low carbs.  - I ate as little bread as possible (it triggers my baked goods addiction).  - 165-200g protein per day (200 lbs lean mass x 0.82g per lb).  - 4-5 servings of fruit and the same for vegetables.  I went with yams/sweet potatoes, brown rice, and whole grain pasta for when I ate grains. I did not worry about the carbs in fruit - most are pretty good on the glycemic index and it would take around 40 peaches to hit the 2500 calorie mark, so I went with the ""I like fruit and it's filling so I'm going to eat a lot of it"" approach. **Weight Program:** 3 sets of 5 reps for most of it. I changed to 12x3 every few months and tried to vary my exercises monthly. I know the mantra is 5x5 around here, but there's some evidence that the 4th and 5th set have severely diminishing returns and I needed my program to be short to keep myself on it early on. Day 1 - 5x3 bench @ 225 lbs - 5x3 tri's (cable) @ 90 - 5x3 wrist curls + finger curls (bar) @ 60  - 5x3 chest fly's @ 215 - 5x3 skull crushers @ 80 - 5x3 reverse grip wrist curls @ 60  Day 2 - 5x3 Cable rows @ 280 lbs - 5x3 Preacher curls @ 85 - 5x3 Lat pulldowns @ 130 - 5x3 Hammer curls (dumbbells) @ 40  - 5x3 Back extensions @ 250 lbs Day 3 - 5x3 Leg press @ 600 lbs - 5x3 Shoulder press @ 145 - 10x3 Calf Raises (seated) @ 340 (it wouldn't hold any more plates) - 5x3 shrugs (bar) @ 405 - 5x3 leg curls @ 220 And finally the progress pics: http://imgur.com/a/PSvFJ  The last picture was 2 months ago at 275 lbs.  The last 2 months were rough and my weight fluctuated a lot both up and down (hit 300, then back down to 280, then 290, etc...), but I went back on the shakes recently and am on my way again. I'm currently about 275 with 26% body fat, and I want to reduce it further before I get the loose skin snipped. edit: I forgot to apostrophe. Edit 2: obligatory R.I.P. inbox. I will try and answer as many questions as I can before I have to leave for Work. Thank you for all your Kind words and support. ","Holy shit, well done.",553

4gzahc,"This is going to be a bit long and rambling post but for for those that don't really give a shit: **tl;dr: the mods are considering us not being a default sub anymore, particularly so we can opt out of /r/all.  What do you think?  [Take a survey!](http://goo.gl/forms/UsRNCERpiM)** It was a balmy Cinco de Mayo two years ago and I was a few margaritas deep on my deck when the admins popped the question: ""Would you be interested in becoming a default sub?""  We can blame the alcohol but I still think becoming a default sub was a neat opportunity for /r/Fitness.  At the time, we discussed the risks but ultimately the mod team decided that getting the wiki at the fingertips of more people and putting /r/Fitness' tough love in front of a wider audience would ultimately do more good and help more people reach their fitness goals.   I do think a lot of good things came out of us becoming a default sub, but after two years us mods are kinda over it.  And the stick nudging us over that edge is our attitude and approach to /r/all.   For those unaware, when a post in /r/Fitness reaches the top 100 of /r/all it is automatically locked.  (It should be noted this was the case long before we were a default.)  It was clear then - and even more clear now - that when our posts reach /r/all they take a sharp and rapid nose dive right into the shitter.  It's terrible.  Most people don't actually get that though, because the mods do work to keep the trash comments removed as the posts become more popular.  But if a woman's progress post blows up... [sweet jesus](https://imgur.com/a/Da60T) [the kind of comments](https://imgur.com/a/ZqbXO) that start rolling in...   /r/Fitness has always been better than that, and it sucks that the masses get to derail our best and brightest.   Furthermore, take a look at [our modlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/about/moderators).  It's short and of the 11 there, one is just the CSS guy, two are bots, and two are absentee.  So we are effectively modding this sub with 6 people.  You're not going to find many defaults with that small of a list of active mods.  But we like it that way, which is why the obvious solution of adding more mods to deal with the onslaught of /r/all debauchery is not something we are considering.  Especially after our recent call for new moderators received a lukewarm reception.  So we just lock things down.  And while it helps keep the riff raff at bay and our work load down, it sucks for *our community*.  There is an option for subs to opt out of /r/all, but it's not one available to default subreddits.  **In an effort to stop killing threads to the detriment of /r/Fitness users, the mod team feels it's worth the loss of the default status to gain the ability to opt out of /r/all.**   And quite frankly, going back to being a sub where people have to find us (not that it's hard) instead of everyone just wandering through sounds really damn nice.  And I think it will help us [get to know ourselves better as a community again.](http://i.imgur.com/utEgUAZ.gif)   But before doing so, we wanted to put this question to the community to get your feedback and hear your thoughts.  **Do you think we should remain a default or not?

I tried to come back to play senior year but I sucked and lost my starting position. Eventually I stopped sports and tried to focus on my studies. Leading into college where i continued to eat like i was in football. I gained an insane amount of weight but kind of just shrugged it off as w.e (kinda got somewhat depressed etc...)   **The start of changing** Eventually I got accepted into a nursing program and slowly made a few small life style changes. However my big epiphany moment was during my second semester (happened to be because of a girl lol). I just started to go run and completely changed my diet. Losing 40 lbs in a three month period. Eventually I kept doing my thing but unfortunately failed out of school (shit is rough yo). Really got depressed and contemplated hurting myself, but i never went through with it. I just kept doing only cardio to de-stress.  **Start of lifting** When i first started to lose weight all i did was cardio and diet. Eventually I came across /r/Fitness where i was encouraged to start lifting weights. I started to do SL 5x5, but I was super weak from what I used to lift during my football days. However my muscles somewhat recovered and within about two months i was lifting a fairly decent amount again (feelsgoodman).  **Current Diet** Ive basically been on a cut for 2.5 years. For the first year i never really tracked caloric intake, but i eventually stalled out and became more diligent with my calories. Im currently doing a 40/40/20 macro split with 1700 calories per day (I wanted rock hard abs and an Adonis belt lol)  **Current lifting stats/personal records** I'm currently doing a PPL routine with added in cardio/abs day interspersed between days when I'm not at work or at school (currently in another nursing program) which can be found here. Some of my lifts are lagging, but I'm proud of what I can do. http://imgur.com/z3VeCFj  **Best 1 Mile time:** 0:06:08 **Best 5k time:** 00:22:26 **Best half marathon time (only ran once haha):** 02:18:21  **Current 1RM** **squat:** 370lbs **DL:** 365lbs **bench:** 285lbs (did 310 when i was in football) **OHP:** 165lbs   Big shout-out to all my friends/family who have supported me in my progress, and a special shout-out to /r/fitness.

[Warrior Dash Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/sh6YcYv.jpg) [Warrior Dash picture 3](http://i.imgur.com/puXMysy.jpg)  For people who don't click the original post. I used to joke about having ""former athlete syndrome."" I threw shotput in college and competed about 280-290. I'm 6'1"" or a bit taller. After college came law school and a job that sucked up 80 hours a week, and I never changed how I was eating in college, not even thinking it abnormal to eat 3 big meals a day totaling maybe 3500 calories. By about 8 years after college, by weight had ballooned from 280 to 380.  The picture in the progress is one of the closest decent ones, but may not be my very heaviest.  In march 2014 I decided to make a change and hit the gym pretty hard, mainly focusing on cardio, something I hated with a passion before. I started with 30 minutes on the elliptical 5 days a week + weights. Adding to that walking/jogging with my dog, and trying to do something for a couple hours every weekend, mainly hiking and jogging. Weight lifting was the same core lifts I'd done in college, Bench, inclinde, OHP, Rosws, tricep extensions, curls, squat, leg extensions, deadlifts, calf raises and an ab  workout.   Mostly 3x5 or 5x5 sets.  I also dramatically changed how I was eating. Gave up fast food entirely as well as most processed stuff. I started logging everything I eat in a cell phone app. (I still think Noom is a better written app, but I use MFP as well for certain features it has).  By about the year mark (march 2015) I decided I would sign up for a warrior dash as an aspirational goal, I'd never run any significant distance before, but I discovered that even at 265 ish, it was suddenly easier than it had been before. THe warrior dash in April 2015 was my first 5k.   Since I've done about 6 5k's, an 8k, and 2 10k's.  My 5k time is ~28 minutes.  I did my second warrior dash a few weeks ago and finished in under 38 minutes, which is the source of the pictures.    I also mix in HIIT workouts once or twice a week.  I'm already signed up for a tough mudder 10 mile in october, which is my next aspirational goal.  The first hundred pounds came off super fast, 9 months.   Going from 275 to 225 has taken much of the rest of the time with some ups and downs. I had a rotator cuff tear and a broken hand last fall that kept me from working out for a while.  I was stalled in the 240's for about 6 months and redoubled my efforts after the new year to log every calorie and stick to an exact diet.   THe recent posts about the biggest loser contestants caught my attention because my TDEE is also somewhat lower than it should be given my weight. Even with pretty significant workouts, my TDEE at this point is only 2400 calories or so, and I can lose a pound a week or a bit less if I successfully stick to 1700 and 5-6 good workouts in  My mind did adjust to healthier tastes, but I absolutely still have problems knowing when I'm full and still have cravings.  Despite being at a fairly consistent calorie deficit, I've raised my bench since the prior post, going to a 275 1RM.   My squat's gone down a bit, I can still rep out 315, but would have  issues doing a full 5x5 set of it like I could before, I can do 5 reps, 3-4 sets.  My hands are the weak point on my deadlift so I'm working on that too.  At this point I want to stay about 225, but I'm going to work on getting my bodyfat a bit lower without a specific goal weight in mind.  Tape measure method says my bodyfat is 22% right now, but lose skin makes it look worse, and I'm considering getting a scan done on that.  I'd like to be maybe 15%.   ","Wow, you are a true inspiration! I was lying in bed, feeling sorry for myself about allowing poor habits to let the weight pile on. I read this post and feel like it is within my grasp to get my body and my old athleticism back. Seriously, thank you for chronicling your accomplishments and sharing them here. I'm going to the gym.

4iou1d,"Two years ago I separated from the military and, as you would expect, gained a bunch of weight.  Roughly from being in great shape and 180 lbs to terrible shape and 230 lbs.  My wife didn’t seem to care and I didn’t have to do PT anymore, so I didn’t have much drive to go back to the gym.  My diet was absolute trash and I had several alcoholic beverages a night. I had to buy bigger pants and most of my t-shirts were starting to get a little too snug.  I don’t feel my attitude changed that much, but I knew that I was letting myself fall into a hole that was going to be hard to get out of. I work as a contractor at the same base I was stationed at, and late last year I got the ‘opportunity’ to deploy for four months.  120 days straight of turning wrenches overseas didn’t sound fun at all (and it hasn’t been), but it gave me all the tools to try and get back in shape: an unchanging schedule, easy diet regulation (chow hall food), and a 24HR fitness center.   I’m 27 years old, 5’8” tall, and when I got here in January the scale read 233 lbs. [Scale](http://i.imgur.com/9fLgYuU.jpg) Start [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qLJTknF.jpg) 30 Days [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/6azwMly.jpg) 60 Days [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/zXtOaiO.jpg) 90 Days [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/QqRX7pJ.jpg) 120 days [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/kBodTpH.jpg) **The Workout** My routine changed as time went on and I was able to demand more from my body, but this is what I settled into.  The fitness center is about 1.5 miles from where I’m  housed, so I started walking to and from the gym every day.  Eventually I was able to start jogging back instead of walking, and soon started altering my route to cover more distance.  Now I’m jogging two miles to the gym, lifting, then jogging a three mile route back.  Towards the end I was doing this 6 days a week. My whole goal was to cut fat, so most of my lifts are of the light-weight, high-rep variety.  I would usually do my sets as quickly as possible, interval style, getting in about 6-8 different lifts (3-4 sets each, of 15-20 reps) in about 30 min.  I tried to never do the same lifts for a muscle group two times in a row, and always finished each workout with three sets of something for abs.  I was going to type out a list of the workouts I did for each muscle group, but you can look up lists and find things that work best for you.   Here is the planner I made to keep track of my workouts, weight loss, how much I was running every day, and the days left till I get to come home. **The Diet** Like I mentioned before, my diet was pretty bad before I got here.  Way too much fast food and bourbon.  For the first couple months I kept myself to about 1000-1200 calories a day, and increased it slightly as my workouts intensified.  As far as what foods I eat, its the same old shit you hear.  High protein, low carb.  While working my 12hr shift we got two meal breaks and always ate at the chow hall on base so it was pretty easy to eat healthy.  Right after my workout I would eat the same breakfast every day, which was two eggs with some veggies, oatmeal with some raisins or bananas, grits, a piece of wheat toast or half of a bagel, and some milk. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/S76HtNB.jpg) For lunch is was a little harder because the chow hall wouldn’t always have healthy options, but I would usually have one piece of meat (usually chicken breast, grilled pork chop, or baked turkey), steamed rice, and some vegetables [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Mbn1cHg.jpg) Between meals I tried to always have a little something in my stomach to keep my metabolism burning.  Whenever I felt a hunger pang I would eat half of a protein or fiber bar.  It is also important to remember that your metabolism slows down considerably when you sleep, so to maximize my fat loss I would avoid eating anything within four hours of bedtime.  A lot of times this means going to bed hungry, which sucks, but when it was bad enough to keep me awake I would have half a scoop of protein in some water and that usually helped. Cheat food:  I hear a lot of people talk about cheat days.  They don’t exist. Not really anyway.  I gave myself one cheat MEAL a week, and made sure I had it as early in the day as possible.  I could eat pizza or a burger and fries for one meal a week and still maintain my weight loss.  Turn that one meal into a whole day of bad food though and you’re setting yourself up for failure. **Supplementation** For the first two months I used a pre-workout supplement (Pump HD by bpi has always been my favorite), Lipo-6 Black fat burner, and a typical Whey protein. For the last two months I did the same but switched out the Lipo for the Animal Cuts stack. Don’t put too much stock in fat burners and cutting pills,  they only help if you are already working really hard, and even then only a little.  I did find that they helped with my energy in the gym though.  Very noticeably.  Especially the Animal Stack.  I would have to be careful with my pre-supplement though.  The Lipo and the Animal Stack already had their own stimulants so I would only use about 1/3 of a scoop, sipping it as I walked or jogged to the gym.  **Tips and Tricks** A couple small things can make a big difference when it comes to getting back in shape.  One of the things that helped me the most was writing everything down.  Being able to look back and see everything I had done (or didn’t do) was motivating.   Another big helper was timing.  I suggest going to the gym or exercising right after you wake up.  Your body uses its stored energy to fuel your workout, rather than the food you’ve been eating throughout the day, and your metabolism will be working harder all day to help your body recover. Plus a good workout will make you feel better and happier all day.  It also helps you control your diet.  Instead of, “Hey I can eat this cause I’ll just work it off at the gym later,” its, “I’ve already worked out and am doing good today, I’m not going to ruin it by eating something unhealthy.” Make going to the gym a necessity, as much as eating and sleeping.  Its easy to go to the gym every day if you don’t give yourself a choice.  Just make it a concrete part of your day to go to the gym, and after a couple weeks you won’t have to make yourself go because you’ll feel great and you’ll WANT to. Compete with yourself. Since you’re writing everything down, keep track of your weekly milestones, and try to break them.  Not just how much you can bench or curl, but how many miles you walk or run, how many days in a row (excluding your cheat meal) you stick to your healthy diet. You don’t have to do this permanently.  Yes its good to maintain a regular exercise routine, but you don’t have to go at full speed all the time.  I’m doing this now, but I certainly don’t plan on losing any more weight once I get home.  I will dial it back considerably and work on maintaining.  Its a lot easier to keep it off than it is to lose it.","You did a great job but some of the things you did and said are honestly unnecessary...old beliefs that have been proven false throughout the years. Like when you say you went to bed starving because you need to maximize fat loss and increase your metabolism. It's the total caloric intake that controls how much fat loss you lose. You COULD eat right before bed if you're total calories of the day haven't reached your goal. I just wanted to point this out because while it works, some people torture themselves with their diet, routine, etc.",296

I have not been on the /r/fitness subreddit for very long but frequented /r/ketogains for a long time during the initial cut. Thank you all for your advice. TL;DR: Ate at a deficit while cutting carbs, kept up my protein intake while lifting. Reached goal weight and slowly increased calories to maintenance and a bit above to gain muscle. PICTURES: sorry deleted pics  **A little background**: I was a cross country/track running in highschool but let myself go in the following 4.5 years of college. I occasionally went to the gym, but with no real goal in mind. I never really saw myself as too big, but definitely not in shape. Out of college, I got my first big job, and didnt want to cook so I usually ate out everyday for lunch. I was going to the gym, but again, no real goal in mind. I purchased a scale and that was what really did it for me. If I ever hit 200 I knew something needed to change.  **The Start:** So I hopped back on the low carb /r/keto train hard. I am a creature of habit, so cold turkey is what I do well with.  No cheat meals. I set my deficit pretty aggressive and started losing weight. At the same time, I made my gym attendance much more regular. 3 times a week for about 9 months. Workout as follows: (3sets x 8reps ftw, superset the two exercises) > Bench Press + Calf Raise >  > Wide grip pullups + Abs >  > Squat/Leg Press + Dips >  > Bicep Curls + Moar Abs > > Seated Row + Something else I wanted to workout > > I may be missing somethings, but that was the routine for the most part. Macros/Main Meals: > As per /r/ketogains subreddit, I tried to keep protein around 1g/lb of lean body mass. Kept carbs as low as possible and filled the rest with fat. And I also tried my hand at intermittent fasting to try and speed things up. > > Lunch (@work): ~0.8lb grilled chicken breast, 3x Cheese Stick, Ranch/Sriracha for dipping > > Dinner: 5x Eggs scrambled with cheese and Sriracha > > I filled in other macros with almonds, pork rinds, peanut butter, celery, other veggies I hit my first goal of 165, and reevaluated. I was surprised to learn how small of a frame I had so I kept cutting. 155 went by and I was fairly content, but reeeeeallly wanted abs. They were coming in slowly, but it meant I had even more fat to lose. So I tried to push it a bit more. I ended my cut a tad over 145. **After ~9 Months:** I ate at maintenance for a bit, still pretty low carb just because of habit. I have since started eating slightly above maintenance to try and slowly put on some more muscle. I am still pretty scared of putting fat back on, so this slow bulk seems to be working for me. My current workout has changed since I want to go to the gym more often and work muscle groups twice a week. Its 'Shortcut to Shred' but modified a bit. It ended up looking a bit like PHAT. I am currently working on adding carbs back into my diet. Going to try to keep sugar out however, I tended to binge sugary candies before. > Monday - Wednesday (6-8 reps) , Thursday - Saturday (9-11 reps) > > Chest/Tri, Shoulders/Legs, Back/Bi *Note: I am sorry I don't have starting lift numbers or any 1 rep maxes currently* Supplements: > ON Protein, multivitamin, potassium , calcium, creatine > > Preworkout after work, before gym (coffee doesnt do it for me anymore) **Progress Pictures** sorry deleted pics  **Current Goal:**  My current goal is to keep slowing putting muscle on. The first goal would be 165lbs and look fantastic in a new suit. I have two weddings coming up I have to be in. **Conclusion:** I may not be as lean or as big as I want, but I am happy with my progress so far. I am in love with the gym now and dont see myself slowing down for a while. Its like a real life RPG! +4 strength, +5 size, +1 self-loathing! The best thing I have gained from this experience IMO is discipline. I am probably leaving something out, or I may have formatted it terribly, so feel free to ask questions. Thanks for reading, just wanted to share. Edit 3: There may have been some confusion about my goal. > I may not be as lean or as big as I want, but I am happy with my progress so far. I am not looking to bodybuild, I am not looking to powerlift, I am trying to look good in my own eyes. Which in this case is a bit bigger and a bit leaner. That goal may always be on the next hill over, but I'm going to enjoy the journey. ","> I may not be as lean or as big as I want   No one ever is.  Solid progress, dude.",91
4jma5z,"Almost coming up on my year mark and wanted to share with you guys my progress so far and what I learned. [Progress pics](http://imgur.com/a/ZaAJy) **Starting:** My initial weight was 150lbs and height is 6'2 (189cm). I had tried lifting in college my sophomore and junior years but knew nothing at the time about diet or technique. I ended up injuring my back trying to lift WAY too heavy and stopped altogether.  My diet was horrible, and I did not exercise at all the next two years and pretty much ate everything and anything I wanted. I started to get chronic lower back pains and initially blamed my height for it. A year later and it was still a problem (even after stretching, doctors and chiropractor visits). I decided to start working out again to strengthen my lower back and to improve my overall physique.  **Start of Calisthenics (5 months)** I started off doing calisthenics only. My work had an outside 'jungle gym' so I used this as my main workout area.  My workout consisted of mainly pull-ups, pushups, dips, and squats and was broken into a 4 day workout split. I did different variations of these main exercises with high intensity and very low rest time (30-45 seconds max). I usually did them circuit style and my workouts only lasted for 30 minutes (I did about 4-5 sets). But since it was such high intensity, my body/muscles grew a lot.  I also coupled this with a high caloric diet (4000) and almost no cardio. I wanted to gain a lot of weight so I tried to retain as much calories as possible during my bulk.  **Weightlifting** After my bulk, I managed to gain about 35lbs of muscle and fat (mostly fat) and weighed around 185lbs. It felt great knowing that I could actually put on weight! I made pretty decent gains with calisthenics, mostly because my weight kept increasing as well as the number of sets and reps I did. But after awhile I felt I needed a changed and started lifting weights.  My lifts are still centered around pullups, dips, pushups, and squats, except that I add weight to them (I started doing bench press and deadlifts as well).  **Diet** I've cut back significantly on my calorie intake and now only eat around 2500 a day. I've also added back cardio into my workouts and run/sprint about 2-3 times a week.  **Supplements** When I was bulking, I took creatine and protein powder. But as of know, I only take creatine. I feel my diet is solid enough to provide me enough protein for the day.  **Sleep and Workout Schedule** I usually workout in the morning around 5:30am everyday because work takes up most of my day (9am-5pm), and I still wanted to have time to spend with my girlfriend (5pm - whenever she decides). I still got about 7-8 hours of sleep by sleeping around 10pm or 11pm.  I used to hate waking up early, but now I love it. One of the benefits for me personally, is that everything after my workout is centered around rebuilding the muscles I just tore down. I'm a lot more conscious of what foods I eat and what my body needs in order to repair. Another benefit is most people aren't working out in the morning so the gym is empty. Whenever I try going to the gym after work, the amount of people there is crazy. It also really messes up my rest times and workouts altogether. But it is really just depends on your schedule and preferences.  **Conclusion** So far, this has been the longest I've ever stuck with anything in my life. The best thing is, my lower back no longer hurts! The biggest contribution I believe to my back no longer hurting is core workouts. Planks are a GODSEND. Do them for 10 minutes everyday (take as many rests as you need, but hold the plank for a total of 10 minutes) if you have lower back pain. I usually do them at the end of my workouts on leg days. They've helped a lot with my squats and deadlifts.  One of the most rewarding things that has come about this is that I was able to inspire people to workout. I've been religiously recording my progress and transformation over the past year on Facebook and created a  page to document my journey and share my experience. It's been working out amazingly well and I have managed to get 100,000 people like and follow my page. It's been an awesome year. I hope this inspired more people like myself to start lifting and to make a change. EDIT: Some of you have asked about my diet when I was bulking. I wrote a blog detailing it here: http://www.stikfitness.com/bulking-and-nutrition/. Thanks for all the nice PMs everyone and hope this helps.   EDIT2: I forgot to mention my present weight which is 168lbs at around 14% BF. I've been told it might be lower and more like 12% though. And yes, I am actually a 6'2 asian. I'm actually closer to 6'3, but here's a [picture](http://imgur.com/yoUf48M) I took back in September 2015. My girlfriend for scale (she is 5'0 tall).  EDIT3: WOW. Thank you guys for all the upvotes. There's so many questions but I'll try to answer them all. One frequent question is about the planks and it helping my lower back. First I'd like to clarify and say that planks did not 'heal' my lower back pain. Second, I'm also not a licensed PT, so be sure to visit your doctor or therapist first to figure out what's wrong and why it hurts. I took a good amount of rest time (icing, staying in bed with feet elevated, massaging, etc) before I even attempted to do planks. I stretched my butt, hips, and lower back, but avoided any flexion stretching (i.e. touching toes), and started doing superman holds as well. After a few weeks when my lower back started to heal, then I started incorporating planks into my workout to strengthen the area to help prevent future injuries.  EDIT4: I have never tried to lift my 1RM but here are my numbers for 3 reps: Dumbbell bench press (80lbs), Squat (225lb), Deadlift (305lb). I prefer and usually do dumbbell bench press since I workout alone and can push myself more without being afraid of getting stuck. EDIT5: Some of you have asked for my social media. Here's the link to my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theabenelson/) page and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aabenelson). I'm pretty active on social media so feel free to reach out to me there if you guys have any other questions about my progress. Thanks!",he got dem stronk booby genetics,655

Chips, candy, deepfried snacks, ice cream sundaes, etc.  - Mom has no comprehension of what ""healthy"" means. Taco salad made of Tostitos chips for dinner? = healthy. Gummy candies say they are made with fruit? = healthy. Massive ice cream sundae + waffle bowl + [this stuff](http://images.smuckers.ca/images/products/1/product_297.jpg) (she calls it jam) with fruit on top? = healthy! ""it's fruit! the rest is just to make it taste good!"". Wonder bread, sunny D, hamburger helper, sugary cereals, frozen pizza - all are ""healthy""!  - Little brother, 14, eats what my mom serves him. In many cases this is WAY too much food. The lunches/dinners aren't too bad, it's the fucking snacks she makes him that are making him huge. He is constantly eating, because she is constantly eating. If she makes herself something, she will make two and give one to my younger brother. Usually this is: a bag of popcorn (each), 200g bag of chips (each), ice cream, lots of 'little' things like those red white and blue space popsicles or bags of gold fish crackers.  - HONESTLY my little brother doesn't give a shit about any of this stuff, he just eats what he's given. If you don't offer him anything he won't ask for it, but what 14 year old is going to turn down a bowl of ice cream? - I have tried talking to my mom rationally about this stuff. It doesn't work. Her habits and lifestyle are pretty set and I really don't think I'm going to change her. I've even gone so far as documenting all of the food my brother ate one day, breaking down the nutritional information, and presenting it to my mom. (4200 calories. 6 hours spent watching TV after school). She dismissed it. #What can I do?   I try to lead by example. I eat healthy, and offer to cook healthy meals for my whole family. Sometimes my mom accepts, other times she firmly tells me ""no, I'm making X for dinner."" and if I feed my brother anyway she'll just feed him more.  I have a gym membership and casually brought up the idea of ""hey, you should come to the gym today!"" to my brother. It seemed to make him nervous/scared. He is very insecure about his weight.  I should point out that my little brother and I are good friends. We hang out, laugh, and interact a lot. It's a very positive relationship. All advice is welcome. Edit: I'm 21, male. I live away from home while in school but am home for the summer. Edit2: Holy shit, woke up to 900 comments. Thank you everyone, I will read through them all. ","Your mum is most likely beyond help - as you said, she's set in her ways. However, your brother is still young. Try taking him under your wing, show him healthy foods and snacks that you eat. Get him to help you cook. He doesn't need to go to the gym, try doing HIIT workouts at home together, or go for a run together.

Below I share my beginning and current stats along with information about the dieting protocol I utilized along with exercise protocol I experienced with. Please feel free to comment and I will do my best to answer more questions if the interest is there. **Fitness has changed my life.** Growing up, I was bullied mercilessly. I still remember times when I was strangled in public and no one stood up for me. I was laughed at and beat up so many times, was the youngest in my class for the majority of my childhood years and also one of the skinniest. I was suicidal and severely depressed up until my early teen years.  I began working out in my room when I was around 12 with just a push-up set and no idea how to train, but as I pursued fitness, I realized that it was a venue for me to rise above and become someone who I wanted to be: outgoing, confident, energetic, positive and happy. It has brought me all those and more. My physique began to transform, and when I turned 17 and entered college, I began pursuing it as a lifestyle. It had developed into a passion. I also got NASM-certified at 18 and began training clients of all ages, developing great relationships and having the opportunity to change lives through training like I never would have imagined. However, up until last year, I was still in a mental shell. I suffered from severe social anxiety and would get panic attacks when I was in certain situations and deciding whether or not to attend a social event. I grew up in a very traditional Asian family and was cultured to be afraid of the world.  This past year, I pushed myself to attend huge **raves solo and sober and forced myself to meet new people as I always wanted to experience the scene (I love EDM). I documented some of it in the video and hope it can inspire some of you all out there. These were some of the most exhilarating experiences of my life.** **Next Steps:** **Starting a youtube channel and inspiring and reaching more people through fitness has been a dream of mine the past few years and is the next step for me.** I have been approached by many people regarding fitness, so I feel a big calling to start a channel to share my journey and want to encompass fitness, confidence and progressing in life. My goal through fitness is not just to improve myself, but also to impact, change and inspire others to pursue fitness and a happier life. In the future I would like to open my own gym and may try my hand at competing in the NPC or in powerlifting competitions. I am also developing my training business as I have had success training clients in person and am branching out in the Los Angeles area. I may pursue further schooling in the future for physical therapy or medicine.  Due to school these past few years, I did not feel I could commit fully to developing a quality channel. I busted my butt in college and achieved high honors, but now I am pursuing this endeavor to hopefully inspire more people throughout the world through my passion for fitness.  Here are the stats to my transformation and my info: **Beginning weight, height and age**: 140 lbs, 5’9, 16 years old **My current weight, height and age:** 185 lbs, 6’ and 21 years old **Current credentials:** -Certified as a Personal Trainer, corrective exercise specialist and fitness nutrition specialist by the National Academy of Sports Medicine: CPT, CES, FNS  -Bachelor of Science: Phi Beta Kappa in Human Biology Exercise Physiology -Fitness Model with Naturally Fit Agency -Owner at DavidWangFitness **Detailed Diet and exercise routine history:** -Consistently tracking macros for 1023 days straight at this point and modifying as necessary -In the beginning, I was extremely strict with my diet, eating every 2 hours, packing a massive cooler with me to work daily and was even ridiculed for doing this. But it helped me stay on track towards my fitness goals. I have learned a lot through education since this point and how to modify my diet further to adjust to situations, but meal prepping and sticking to whole foods the majority of the time has been a big part of my diet plan. -**Calories consumed**: From 16 - 17, I consumed around 3000 calories a day as this allowed me to make significant noob gains. However, I modified my caloric intake as I saw fit based on my progress. If my weight was stalling or I was not seeing strength gains, I slightly increased my calories to allow for a slightly greater surplus. However, I aimed to always stay fairly lean. I gauged this by my overall definition (mostly abs) and weight. If I wanted to get leaner, I tracked macros and adjusted accordingly to allow for a caloric deficit and gauged progress by weight and how I looked.  -**Supplements consumed**: Whey protein, creatine, beta alanine, fish oil, BCAAs, multivitamin. All natural stuff. I have never used a pre-workout in my life as I feel these are unnecessary and often have a ton of stimulants like caffeine and ingredients and can cause dependency. I zone in for my training sessions 10 - 15 minutes before I train and meditate, visualizing success and preparing for intensity. The mind and focusing 100% on your training goals to me is far more powerful than a pre-workout supplement. -**Programs followed**: When I first began training (before 16), I had no knowledge whatsoever about program design…would knock out tons of push-ups in my room. Led to shoulder impingement and elbow tendonitis from improper training (not enough pulling to balance the pushing). This made me start learning how to train smart and helped me develop a passion for the body. I currently structure my own training split as I have found what works best for my body, which is DUP (daily undulating periodization) style training. However, around 16 years old, I trained for athletics and plyometrics, following volume and explosive based training for basketball.  Then, I began similar protocol to starting strength to build strength, but stuck with lower reps for big compounds and hypertrophy rep ranges for accessories. Over time, I developed more knowledge and began modifying rep ranges for strength and hypertrophy protocol based on my progress and goals. Today I primarily stick with DUP.  -**Beginning stats for bench, squat and deadlift**:  Bench: 95 lbs for 1 rep Squat: 95 lbs for 3x5 superset with step-ups 3x5 Deadlift: ~135 lbs **Current stats for bench, squat and deadlift:** Bench: ~260…I typically stick with incline bench for 225 for reps…3x3 or so due to bench causing issues for me the in past due to previous shoulder impingement. But I have been recently incorporating it back into my routine. Squat: 420…2x3 Deadlift: 525…2x3 **Thank You:** **Thank you all for taking the time to read this post and I hope it inspires you guys to take control of your life and settle for nothing less.**",Wow -- great work! Incredible transformation and great information. This is truly a great post. I wish you luck and continued health and happiness!,406
4na853,"http://imgur.com/a/ei7uA   # READ THE LAST UPDATE  Today was a monumental milestone for me. After spending most of my life being fat, and a point of hitting rock bottom, I finally got my shit together. While I still have some ways to go, I'm so happy that most of this journey is done with.  Please don't wait to lose weight. I feel 100 times better than I ever did when I was at 300lbs mentally and physically. The only thing that awaited me with that lifestyle was diabetes, hypertension, and a shorter time on this earth. Girls look at me now, I don't worry about chairs creaking as I sit down, and overall I have way more confidence than ever before.  I lost a lot of weight through intermittent fasting and eating keto. For workout I was on ICF but now do a modified version of coolcicada's PPL routine.  WE'RE ALL GONNA MAKE IT!  **EDIT to fix post for rules** #WORK OUT REGIMENT  **PUSH** Benchpress - 3x5 185 Overhead press - 3x5 115 Incline Bench - 3x5 135 Dumbbell side lateral raises - 3x10 25 Dumbbell straight lateral raises - 3x10 25 or 20 if I'm weak Rope Pushdowns - 3x10 (machine at gym is resistance based so Idk the weight) Overhead dumbbell extension - 3x10 35 Shrugs - 3x10 275 **PULL** Chin-ups - 3x10 bodyweight Bent over row - 3x5 135 Lat pull down - 3x10 130 Seated row - 3x10 130 Facepulls - 3x10 70 Preacher curls - 3x10 170 (on machine, then I do a dead set to get really pumped, not sure if that's what it's called but I start at 170 and do as many reps as I can, when I fail I drop 20 lbs and repeat until no more weight) T-Bar row - 3x10 50-75, i'm a pussy on this one **LEGS** Legs I keep very short but very grueling (for me at least) Squats - 5x5 225 (I have shit form on squats so hurt myself so I do hack squats if my legs are messed up.) Hack Squats (if not doing Squats) - 5x5 3 plates, don't know the weight of the sled Deadlift - 1x5 315, just hit one rep max of 405! Leg press - 3x8 450 Standing calf raises - 3xfailure 250 Seated calf raises - 3xfailure 75 I also do 3x15 crunches at the end of every workout day. Not sure if they're crunches, you basically lift yourself by your forearms and raise your legs up to your chest. No strength loss, but slow gains. #Diet Intermittent Fasting and eating Keto were the methods used for this weight loss. Starting out I only ate one meal a day at dinner time, whatever I wanted. I chose this method because I had an unhealthy relationship with food and liked a lot of sweets. I wanted a method of dieting that could control caloric intake while still allowing me to eat whatever I wanted, yet still be satisfied. Following this method, trying to eat a 1500-2000kcal meal was difficult so I knew I couldn't OVEREAT.  Later on, I ate Keto and found that I could eat very low in calories without being hungry and still be satisfied. For the last 50 lbs I didn't count calories at all, I simply ate less than 20g of Carbs and stayed away from sugar. Right now I still eat Keto, I would like to get to 195 before I start bulking but I would guess that I eat around 1700kcal a day.   **Typical meal**  Breakfast would have two Eggs, 5-7 slices of bacon and a protein shake Don't really eat lunch, I usually have some turkey jerky or cheese as a snack. Dinner I typically eat Chicken breast (or fish or hamburger), Tuna, Cheese, maybe eggs, and a protein shake.  There are a ton of great recipes on /r/keto for you to look at. I also eat some celery and nuts but I really stick to meats. The great part about this diet is how filling all the food is. After dinner I simply have no interest in snacking.  **Supplements** 10g Whey before workouts Men's multivitamin 2 Caffeine Pills before workout  **EDIT: thanks a lot for all the support guys. It really does mean a lot to me. I will answer any questions throughout the day if you have any. THANKS SO MUCH!**  **EDIT 2: I'm getting a lot of questions that I want to answer with this edit. First off I only did my workout which is listed for very specific reasons, if you want to get into lifting, don't do that. Read below.**  #Motivation  A lot of people have surprisingly asked me about this. The typical message is to the tune of ""I really want to lose weight or look better, but I have trouble taking the first step."" The one thing I can tell you is that almost everyone who is lifting weights in the gym now started for a completely different reason. Most people start working out for the (wrong) assumption it will help them lose weight. They have dreams of being envied, of having a rock-hard body that ladies swoon for, or becoming something other than the scrawny kid they've been their whole life. I know that was the case for me. I wasn't getting laid and boy did I have an appetite for women.   But something happens within the first few months of lifting seriously. You start to notice progress, not just superficial progress, but strength. Suddenly you attempt a deadlift at a weight you couldn't even get off the ground before, and there you are, fully extended with the weight held firmly in your hands. Your muscles will be pumped full of blood and feel like they're about to rip through your skin. It's a feeling that cannot be adequately described with words and this is my advice to you. **Use whatever motivates you now to get into the gym and stick it out, because that motivation will change.** The truth is, it will take a long time to have a body that belongs on a magazine cover. If this is your main goal, you will fail simply because it takes too long to reach it. But when you come to appreciate strength and realize you can become stronger (if even only a little bit) each month, you will keep coming back.  #What & How should I eat?  I'm a big fan of quotes so I apologize in advance. If you don't remember anything I'm about to say, remember these two:  >*""You cannot outrun a bad diet""*  >*""Weight loss is 95% diet""*  A lot of people set themselves up to fail as soon as they start wanting to lose weight. They see a post like mine and think ""I want to do that, I'm going to lose this weight."" They then create a plan which requires herculean willpower. They're going to cut calories by half and train everyday until they're skinny. Inevitably they fail, binge the weight back on, and repeat. Even though this pattern is very apparent with people we know in our lives, many simply fail to recognize it. How many times have your family members or friends gone on a diet and failed? We all know more than one person who has. It's surprisingly common.   The reason for this is what I chalk up to ignorance, especially with people that others look for guidance. One thing I want to make very clear, *please understand this*, you can lose weight by working out 6 times a week and simply by eating less. You can also cross the ocean in a canoe instead of a plane. What is so difficult about dieting and nutrition is that many people can see results through inefficient means. Our bodies are complex machines of nature but yet we like to attribute weight loss down to simple axioms like Calories in, Calories out. When we see someone who has results we think they must be doing something right, and suddenly the guy who read Starting Strength one time and goes on the bodybuilding.com forums feels like he is the nutrition guru.   One thing that really irks me is exactly Calories In, Calories Out. Of course calories matter, but not in the way people think. A lot of people become VERY DEFENSIVE about their little rule, if someone loses weight on a caloric surplus they're lying. If they're not losing weight on a deficit, they're not just stalling, they're lying. These same people that tell you that only calories matter are also the same people that will tell you there is a difference between a clean & dirty bulk, that a carb-refeed doesn't simply mean eating a pizza, and that you should eat more protein for muscle growth. We know that fat accumulation has other factors than just calories. All I'm asking, is it so hard to believe macro-nutrients play a part of losing weight? Is it such a stretch to believe we maybe evolved to digest some food better than others? I don't think it's a radical proposal.   Many people can see results by simply cutting calories. When we do this, we tend to eat healthier foods anyway. We tend to stop eating fast food and keep track of what we eat. Try this out and see if it works for you, otherwise you should try a diet that makes it very hard to overeat. I for one don't track calories at all. I am currently on a intermittent fasting regiment where I only eat from 4-12 every day. It is extremely hard to overeat when you're devouring only one or two huge meals. I tend to mostly eat lean meat which is very filling but I also eat bread and even ice cream or pizza when I feel like it. I really have to force myself to eat to get to a surplus, something most people easily do each day. Another easy way to control dieting is keto because the food is so filling, you rarely feel hungry and the calories are pretty low. Both of these lifestyles allow your body to spend more time burning fat.   Keep an eye out for the type of people that do certain diets and learn from them. If you go to /r/keto for example, most people seem to have a sweet tooth or a binge eating problem that they effectively control through the diet. When they fall off the wagon, they gain a lot of weight back. I don't have these problems so I lost a good amount of fat, regained the water weight from the glycogen coming back into my muscles, but have been losing more weight since then.   This is why it is important to take notice of when you tend to eat, what you crave, and ask yourself why you have gained weight in the first place. I had a terrible diet, where I ate nothing but fast food and pizza during the week. It seems so apparent now how much I was screwing up, but I just didn't really care at the time. I was in denial. Don't be like me. Other people I know have mental blocks that keep them plump like binge eating disorder. If you have a mental issue with food, you need to recognize the thoughts and feelings that lead up to the unhealthy behavior.       ##How should I work out?       If you're read the diet portion of this, we already know that lifting weights will not help you lose weight (efficiently at least). So if you're working out you should be after two things, which are actually one thing, muscle and strength. [You can read this article](http://strengtheory.com/the-new-approach-to-training-volume/) which will tell you basically one thing, bodybuilding is powerlifting and powerlifting is bodybuilding. If you work hard and continually push yourself, muscle will grow. You will see results.      >""Good artists copy, great artists steal"" - http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/    look at that link and read how many great people have used this advice. Not one piece of advice has helped me in more parts of life than this. When we steal, we take something and make it our own. When we want to build our muscle, we look at those who inspire us, people who are champions. We then must do what they do and tailor it to fit our own bodies.       Let's look at popular training methods that are used by people interested in strength training, from beginners to advanced lifters.       [ICF 5x5](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout)       [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.com/get-started)      [StrongLifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/5x5/)      [The Texas Method](https://www.t-nation.com/training/texas-method)      [Madcow 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/madcow-5x5-training-programs/)    One thing you'll notice is that all of these programs are very similar. All of them have you only work out three days a week and some only three exercises a day. In our lives we are often erroneously taught that time = results. A novice might look at these programs and think ""my cousin Chad spends 2 hours a day in the gym, 6 days a week and he's jacked!"" but once again we come back to my analogy. You can cross the ocean in a canoe or in a plane. It's your choice. Do you think [Martin Berkhan](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dtaWqzV6d7M/SuMlTBIBAZI/AAAAAAAAAfI/2q8FdTPNy0k/s320/DSC00316.JPG) or [Mark Rippetoe](http://www.directlyfitness.com/store/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mark-rippletoe.jpg) look weak? Mark created starting strength which is what a lot of the programs above are based on.       These people understand the biology of the human body. Compound lifts like Bench Press, Squats, and Deadlifts work your whole body and build muscle like no other. Rest is a vital component of building mass, something a lot of people don't seem to understand. If you're looking to start lifting with no prior experience, start with ICF or Starting Strength and get cracking :).       I hope this helps some people out, whoever reads this. Thanks for all the support again!    ","Strong face gains, keep it up",499

4or47s,"Sorry, forgot my height in the title. 5'9"".  I just wanted to share the progress that I've made in the past two years to provide motivation for people out there who want to make a change in their lives. First, I'll start by giving what everyone wants to see: the pictures. http://imgur.com/a/mZqgz Here is a youtube video continuing on the story/one of my workouts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-9zLUFM5rU&feature=youtu.be About two years ago, I was not at all the same person that I am today. I did not go into college after graduating high school back in 2012 and my entire day was always spent playing League of Legends or going to play in Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments. I was pretty good at the games but my body paid the price for it. My lifestyle was completely sedentary and I had absolutely no understanding of nutrition or exercise. My parents didn't guide me on the right choices to make and I had to figure things out on my own. Starting in 2014, my friends decided that they wanted to get into the gym and lose some weight. I decided to join them and started off on the Stronglifts 5x5 program. At the time, I did not enjoy the process in the way that I do now. The diet that I followed was not very strict but any means but it was restriction of calories in a simple sense and increased activity which is better than nothing.  Eventually, I began to really see changes in my body composition and it pushed me to go even further. As I lost weight, I realized how differently people began to treat me. Most people were more friendly and I seemed to be valued more as a person. Despite reaching my initial goals of weight loss, it was not enough. Originally, I thought that losing weight was all that would make me happy but I didn't really like the way that I looked. Reddit was a good source of information for me and it kept me focused on my goals.  My diet was eventually down to a near starvation level as an attempt to speed up the process. In hindsight, it was not the best decision but what's done is done. When I reached my lowest weight of 162, I elected to try and gain back some muscle to increase my strength. When I was trying to lose weight, my goal of calories ranged from 1600-1800. It may sound low for a lot of people but I found that following an intermittent fasting schedule really made it much more bearable.  Right now, my goals are more focused on powerlifting as opposed to bodybuilding but both are important to me. I plan to compete one day but I'm not quite strong enough yet. Here's some videos of my best lifts:  435 Deadlift: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO4eIwIredg 350 Squat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpv55F3CVns 235 Bench: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZbGuBT0pRM 155x3 Overhead press: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP03oevapww Throughout, I had tried many different programs. I've done 5/3/1, PPL variations, PHUL, Candito, and other miscellaneous programs. Ultimately, most were very similar when it came to results and it's important to the choose one that you like. Consistency was the key and having fun throughout. I act like a clown sometimes at the gym but it keeps me entertained and keeps me coming.  As my body changed, I changed as a person. I grew to like myself so much more and feel confident in who I am. Within this journey, I started going to college. I was so afraid of not living up to expectations due to all of the time between graduating high school. I managed to become a straight A student and I credit a lot of my brain gainz to my gym gainz. It taught me the mentality of pushing your limits and not settling for less than the best.  Thanks to my friends and family for supporting me throughout. Shoutout to joeyflexx7 from Instagram for giving me diet advice and helping me become a better powerlifter. I highly recommend anyone interested in powerlifting to check out his coaching. https://www.instagram.com/joeyflexx7/ EDIT: One thing to add in regards to dieting. For me, I had to be really tough on myself to stick to it, especially when attending social situations. But as time went on, I learned to accept to be lenient sometimes and to enjoy the things that I wanted sometimes, like frozen Yogurt or Korean BBQ. In a way, I viewed it like a game of winning and losing days and as long as I won more than I lost, I'd make progress. EDIT 2: Sorry if it seemed confusing but yes, gaming is still a large part of my life. I could not do without the social experience of it because it allows for me to bond with my friends who I can't see in person so often. I usually play Hearthstone, Overwatch, and League. Feel free to add me at TrustedLoki on League and TrustedLoki#1651 on Battle.net. What I meant by the title is that my lifestyle before was basically to wake up, play league, eat, and sleep. Now I cut back the playtime immensely and fit it around lifting and school.","Holy legs, like damnnn man. Dem tree trunks tho. Great fucking job btw. But damn. Those legs.",397
4p4bzs,"**Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSziCXNvRdA** Hey everyone, as you might know, I'm a running coach of several years and I go barefoot running a lot, which left me with strong feet. A lot of modern running shoes stabilize your ankles and your feet a lot - and that's generally a good thing for the weak western-world feet, as unsupported shoes would lead to injury in untrained individuals. There are plenty of runners with several years of running experience, who have super weak feet and ankles! If you want stronger feet, you could start by integrating my warmup video into your running, sprinting or jumping routine! Here's a quick recapture of the video: * Use the routine as a warmup, or as a tendon conditioning before activities where your primary muscle groups are in the legs and feet (e.g. running, sprinting, jumping, parkour, etc). * For the first exercise, raise your heels off the floor, then supinate your ankles to the side. Hold for three seconds, come back the middle and back down. * For the second exercise, lean back until you balance on your heels, then flex your big toe and land on it with your body. Lean back again and go to the starting position. * Third exercise: Supinate your feet while your bodyweight rests on the outer side of your feet. Hold for three seconds, then come back. Make sure not to pronate with your knees, but with your ankles. * Fourth exercise: Stand on one leg and extend the other. Now pronate the leg that is in the air. Hold for three seconds, then come back to the starting position. * Last exercise: Just raise your toes off the floor as high as you can, while the rest of the foot is flat on the ground. Hope this will help some of you. I've got some questions for you guys aswell: * Do you think it's important to strengthen your feets? * Have you ever tried barefoot or minimal-shoe running? * If yes, did you like it - or did it give you too many problems? Edit: My inbox exploded over night. Wow, thanks for all the positive (and negative) feedback. Appreciate it. I'm lacking the time to respond to every one of you right now, but I'll try at the weekend.

4pl3yc,"I've been seriously lifting weights for eight years now. Looking back at when I first started, I did so many things wrong but it took me a lot of trial and error to get where I'm at today. By no means do I know everything now -- not even close. I finished school with a BS in Kinesiology and got my CSCS from the National Strength and Conditioning Association, and will start my Master's program in the fall. There have been many times where I was dead-set on being right about things, only to later find out I was wrong.  That's the beauty of exercise and strength training: continuing to learn and grow. You should never be complacent with what you know. Buy books, read articles, ask around your gym. You can only benefit from this. You can add to what you already have in your arsenal and become a complete package. Here are some things I wish I knew when I started 8 years ago. (Disclaimer: this is mainly directed at beginners, but some of these things may be new to you even if you've been lifting for some time) 1. **Just because your numbers are going up doesn't mean you're doing the exercise right.** I remember hitting plenty of milestones in regards to benching, squatting, and deadlifting. However, I would later find out little things I was doing wrong that could have led to injury. Fixing these minor tweaks made the exercises much harder, but I felt much stronger and safer because of them. 2. **Mobility work is extremely important.** After a couple years of lifting, I was at the top of the world. I was bigger, stronger, had more confidence, etc. However, I didn't realize how tight I was, and how that was restricting much of what I did in the weight room and in my life. If you don't know much about mobility, do some research. Thoracic spine mobility, shoulder mobility, hip mobility, ankle mobility, the list goes on and on. Look up people like Kelly Starrett, Eric Cressey, Matthew Ibraham, and others. They all have YouTube channels and their attention to detail in regards to range of motion, stability, and mobility are some of the most useful and eye-opening pieces of information you can find.  3. **Never underestimate the power of warming up.** I see a lot of people walk into the gym, do a couple of shoulder circles, then jump into their workout. I used to do the same thing. However, once I started adding in dynamic warmups and prehab/mobility exercises before lifting, I noticed a world's difference. Consider the exercises you'll be doing that day and work on those areas before you hit the weights.  4. **Compound movements really do trump all.** This was a hard lesson for me to learn. I used to do the typical back/biceps, chest/triceps, shoulders/traps, legs split (which, depending on your goals, isn't necessarily a bad thing). However, once I switched over to Push/Pull/Leg splits, I really noticed a change in my body. Cut down the isolation work. Focus on exercises that will truly challenge your strength, stability, and coordination. Pull ups, chin ups, bent over rows, squats, deadlifts, RDLs, overhead presses, bench/incline bench, pushups, dips, cleans, snatches, etc. Those are the exercises that should make up the majority of your workouts. Find ways to make them harder if you've already mastered them. Not only will your strength increase, but you'll look even better. 5. **The best core work you can do (in terms of both safety and results) doesn't involve crunches and russian twists** Just hear me out on this one. I used to do the usual ab exercises -- sit ups, crunches, leg raises, russian twists, side bends, etc. While these will all work your abs, they do little to nothing to help your overall core stability. Start using movements that will help you in your other lifts (and they will strengthen and grow your abs as well). These movements refer to anti-extension/flexion, anti-rotation, rotational movements, etc. I've been doing these exercises for my core and have noticed my other lifts improve because of them (in addition to being extremely sore the next day): Hanging leg raises, Pallof presses, landmine rotations, woodchops, planks on a stability ball, rollouts (wheel or stability ball), dead bugs, bird dogs, back extensions, dragonfly's, rotational throws, plank slides with gliders, side planks, farmer carries, overhead carries, L sits, etc. A lot of these can be done on one knee or can be made harder by taking away an arm or leg. Basically, any exercise that challenges your body's ability to stay stable has a profound effect on your overall strength and still give you that ab soreness that so many people desire (even though that's not what we're after..but you know what I'm saying). Another note on this: people tend to think of the ""core"" as just your abs. But your core is actually all of the structures that support your trunk and limbs. This includes your abdominals, obliques, shoulder joints, hip joints, lower back muscles, etc. By strengthening these areas, you improve your trunk rigidity. When your trunk rigidity increases, it allows more freedom of movement from your limbs. All proximal tightness will improve distal ROM. 6. **Kettlebells are AWESOME** I avoided kettlebells for a very long time up until these past few years. Talk about a game-changer. Kettlebells allow you to do some crazy movements that'll challenge your body in ways that you didn't think possible. Kettlebell swings are towards the top of my list. Not only are they great for glute strength/power, but it has a carryover effect for teaching proper hip hinge mechanics, and is a great tool to add in for high intensity conditioning. Turkish get ups, windmills, clean and presses, one-armed presses, goblet squats (great for beginners), and many other exercises challenge you in a unique way. If you haven't tried training with kettlebells, I recommend you start now.  7. **Cardio really, really, really does not have to be a drag** I know a lot of people have recently moved away from the long duration treadmill, elliptical, stair-stepper, and biking trend that has dominated the fitness culture for so long. But a lot of people still limit themselves to just that. Circuits and HIIT are truly superior if you want to add in cardio work. Not only is it faster, but it's way less boring and much more fun and effective. Some ideas of exercises to use for your conditioning: PROWLER PUSHES, kettlebell swings, rower intervals, ball slams (both front and side to side), plyometric work, speed ladders, tire flips, mountain climbers, box jumps, sprints, battle ropes, jump ropes, sled pulls (with a rope, working primarily your back), etc. These will not only leave you gassed but also work your entire body instead of just your legs. The possibilities are endless. 8. **Writing out, or following, a detailed workout program will get you to that next level** I can't tell you how many of my workouts in years past consisted of me walking into the gym and meandering from exercise to exercise. Sure I walked out with a nice pump, but how did I know I actually made any progress. When I follow a pre-written routine, I go into the gym on a mission. I know what I'm going to do, how many times, and how much weight I'll use. This really drills discipline into you. Some days you come in feeling sluggish, but if you have a routine set up, you know that you must finish what you wrote down. Otherwise, you'd probably cut your workout short. Having a specific goal changes your mindset completely. Tracking your progress keeps you honest and prepared. Looking back on your numbers and seeing them increase is an awesome feeling. Look into programs like 5/3/1, starting strength, PHAT, just to name a few. Or, if you feel competent enough, write up your own. Take progress pictures. Track your numbers. It is essential for success. 9. **Learn your damn anatomy.** A lot of things really started clicking for me once I began studying anatomy and physiology. Although it may be boring, once you learn about where each bone is, where your muscles originate and insert, how the contraction process takes place, etc. then you will start viewing lifting in a whole new light. Biomechanics is a big one too. These things can change how you lift and help you pay more attention to your technique. For instance, you know you need to keep your elbows back to target your triceps during dips, but do you know WHY? Did you know that your pec actually inserts onto your humerus (arm bone) therefore when you keep your arms close you're essentially taking the pec out of [majority of] the movement? Not only will this help you, but it will help if someone ever needs advice or has any ""why"" questions. Do your muscles flex? Well, no they don't. Your joints flex and extend. Your muscles contract and relax. Find out the function of each muscle, what muscles contribute to elbow/shoulder/hip/knee extension and flexion, and you'll learn a lot of new things. Look up websites like getbodysmart.com which have great illustrations of muscle function and placement. 10. **Nutrition and sleep really are as important as people make them out to be.** I know, I know. Everyone has heard this by now. But I had to mention it. Just google the benefits of sleep if you don't know them, but they are substantial. Nutrition..well, I could write an entire essay on that subject alone but you must, and I mean MUST make this a priority over everything else. If you have your nutrition on point, everything else will come with relative ease. Don't undermine its importance.  11. **Breathing mechanics are important.** This is one that I've really had to learn to incorporate lately. And I'm not talking about the typical ""exhale when exerting/using concentric contractions and inhale during lowering/eccentric contractions. I'm talking about proper breathing and rib alignment. Google or YouTube proper breathing mechanics and setup. 90/90 breathing is a great exercise to use. Most of us here are chest breathers, when in reality we need to be using our diaphragms. This will change the way you do pretty much every exercise. 12. **Film yourself.** I'm adding this one a day late because it totally slipped my mind last night. There's a difference between what you feel like you're doing and what you're ACTUALLY doing. The best way to find out the truth is to film yourself from the side. This is such a big help, especially if you're wondering how your form is. Try to have a friend film you squat or deadlift in slow motion, and watch the video carefully. Look at how you initiate the movement, if/when you start rounding your back, how your head position looks, etc. Or, you can even film yourself doing these exercises in your room with no weight. Although it may sound weird, doing certain exercises with a shirt off will actually show you the muscles themselves moving, and if you do an exercise from a rear view you can see your spinal mechanics at work. It's really an interesting thing to do and will help you spot any errors and correct your form. That's all I could think of for now, but I'm sure there's a lot more. I figured if it was longer than this I'd lose your attention (unless I already lost you a long time ago). Like I said earlier, by no means do I know everything. Not even close. But in order to be the best you can be in the world of physical fitness, you must continue to learn and experiment. Be proud of where you are, but ask yourself what aspects you're ignoring or could improve. Much love r/fitness, I'm constantly amazed at the amount of support and passion you guys have for the subject and each other.

4qn8ne,"Beaker here!! You all probably know me for my recent [315 squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEhchtcioDr/?taken-by=pumping.fe) or [405 deadlift](https://www.instagram.com/p/BBWcOtbioHi/?taken-by=pumping.fe). I currently hold the IPF world record for deadlift in the 57kg (125lb) jr. class. In light of all the progress posts lately, I was inspired (and bored enough) to create my own to show people the aesthetic side of my powerlifting progress. The time span is 5.5 years, with 4 years of that actually lifting. I took a full year off freshman year of college and a semester of my junior year.  **Photos** [Before](http://imgur.com/a/5VMsb) [After](http://imgur.com/a/DLJyT)  **About me** I'm 21 and recently graduated from college. Most of my lifting was done while I was schooling and also working my own business training horses.  **Training** The first year I started out was on a program given to us for a weight training class I took in school. I made decent progress in my shoulders and abs during that time, but it was minimal everywhere else. After that, I switched to Starting Strength for another 1.5 years or so. I saw good strength gains on this program, but had very little aesthetic changes. Eventually I hit a plateau and switched to a PPL program I designed. I stuck to that for 1 year and saw my first leg gains! The past year I have been on an upper/lower split. I have found this program lets me recover best for optimal strength, while still letting me see visual gains.  DAY 1: Deadlift + light squats + glute/hamstring accessories DAY 2: Bench + tricep/chest/upper back accessories DAY 3: Rest DAY 4: Squat + quad accessories DAY 5: Bench + tricep/chest/upper back accessories DAY 6 + 7: Rest  **Nutrition** Currently I am on a light cut/maintenance so I stay within my weight class for my upcoming competition in August. I am eating 1800 calories or less most days with 1 or 2 cheat meals a week. I aim for at least ~100g of protein a day, eat high fat, and limit carb consumption to  less that 30% of my daily calorie intake on most days. I limit sugar to primarily pre and post workout. While maintaining I eat 2000-2200 calories, and while bulking I eat 2300-2500 a day. I stink at bulking so I am usually trying to bulk for the greater part of the year.  **ETC** So my progress was done over 4 years actually lifting. In terms of aesthetics alone, I believe most women could have achieved a similar physique in a slightly shorter time frame. My bulking was/is limited by my weight class of 125 lbs/57kg. I plan on staying in this weight class for a few more years until I age out of juniors. After that I plan on going up a weight class. My physical gains are very slow at this point due to an already low bodyfat% combined with lack of caloric surplus to draw from.","goddamn it beaker quit hogging all the strong some of us need some I can't believe you're this goddamn strong and still a junior, you're making us all look bad.  keep it up ",441
4r33o7,"My question is directed directly to the r/Fitness mantra of ""Calories in, calories out"" being the major important thing when it comes to weight loss. I have seen people giving this advice very often to those asking for weight loss tips, but I can't help but think that it's a little too simplistic.  [I was reading this article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-gut-bacteria-help-make-us-fat-and-thin/) in Scientific American about how gut bacteria influence the way we digest food, and that in twins who are split between being lean and obese, there was a noticeable difference between the health of their gut bacteria. A later study controlled for the old causation/correlation thing, too. And then I learned that [only 10% of Americans eat enough fiber, and 53% of Americans think steak is a significant source of fiber](http://www.nationalfibercouncil.org/af_are.shtml).* And I also read that [dietary fiber](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705355/) [plays a significant role in the health of gut bacteria](http://advances.nutrition.org/content/4/1/16.full), and [a low fiber diet may cause irreversible damage to gut microbe populations over generations](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2016/01/low-fiber-diet-may-cause-irreversible-depletion-of-gut-bacteria.html). And if you decide to improve your gut health, [it may take a long time before your new high-fiber diet has significant effects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3368382/).  *[The same statistic from a less biased source](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/early/2012/05/28/jn.112.160176.full.pdf) So, I mean, why do we just say ""calories in, calories out""? If someone eats 1700 calories of ham sandwiches on wonderbread, and burns 2000 calories, they are still doing damage to their health and stacking the deck against themselves when it comes to losing weight in the long term. I think this is a big reason why chronic dieters continue to gain back weight; they successfully eat at a deficit for a few months and lose the pounds, but their digestive system isn't healthy enough to maintain that weight when they eat a normal diet (not at a calorie deficit, which is obviously unsustainable). I came across so many more studies about how gut microbes control our blood sugar, how often we feel hungry, and even maintain the protective coatings on our nerve endings. With western peoples' diets so shockingly low in fiber and other probiotic foods, and that study that suggested in a few generations the damage could be irreversible, why isn't this being treated as a much more serious problem? Why don't we ever hear about it? I mean at this rate, 90% of Americans are setting up their grandchildren to be completely incapable of even establishing healthy gut microbes. Is that kind of terrifying, or is it just me?  EDIT: Fuck, I butchered the title. Well I'm lazy so I'm not gonna repost it. Do with me what you will, grammar nazis. EDIT 2: [Here is a list of some foods that are high in fiber](http://www.eatingwell.com/nutrition_health/nutrition_news_information/top_fiber_rich_foods_for_good_gut_bacteria), and [another one](https://draxe.com/high-fiber-foods/), and [one more](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/making-one-change-getting-fiber-can-help-weight-loss-201502177721).  Kids, eat your guacamole. ","I've only always assumed that ""calories in, calories out"" is only talking about losing or gaining weight, not about being healthy. I'm also pretty sure most people *know* the importance of vegetables, but it's a completely different story when it comes to actually eating them. ",631
4rd2vb,"[Progress Pics](http://imgur.com/ER8nisA)  **BACKGROUND** Hey guys, I'm William, and I wanted to share my fitness journey and lifestyle change with you. I've been trying to cut for a long time and am very proud of the results I've gotten so far. I'm going to continue the cut through to the end of the summer, and then I'll start gaining more strength (and finally enjoy more food again!). A little bit about myself: I used to be a video game addict. I remember going to bed at 2 am from playing video games and waking up 6 hours later to play again. The cycle repeated until I'd lost everything. My social life, my health, my sense of self and purpose. Now, I am a full time college student, I have a part-time job, and I'm still trying to find myself. Being on this journey has helped me do that. **DIET AND EXERCISE** At first, I just tried to eat less and eyeball calorie intake, but that is much less effective and enjoyable than macro dieting. I've been macro dieting since March and love every second of it. Currently, my macros are: Protein: 234g Carbs: 234g Fat: 52g These macros work for me, and I've been able to lose weight consistently without losing muscle by following them. If you would like more information macros, you can inbox me. I attribute my exercise and programming to many different bodybuilders such as Bradley Martyn, Steve Cook, Christian Guzman and more. It's hard to explain everything in detail, but if you would like to know more about my programming, feel free to inbox me! Here's a sample of how the week would go for me: **DAY 1** Back and Chest Pull-ups: 5x8 Deadlift: 5x5 Shoulder Shrugs: 5x20 Cable Row: 4x12 Bench: 5x8 Incline Bench: 4x10 Bodyweight Dips: 4x15 Ab rollers: 3x8 **DAY 2** Cardio, Arms, Abs Stair Master 20 Minutes Bicep Curls 5x10 Tricep Extension 5x10 Cable Bicep Curl and Tricep Pushdown Superset 5x20 (20 for curls and 20 for pushdowns) Hanging Leg Raises 4x12 V-Ups 4x12  **DAY 3** Shoulders and Back Lateral Raises 4x15 Lat Pulldowns 4x12 Widegrip Cable Rows 4x15 Barbell Rows 4x10 Bentover Lateral Raises 4x12 Side crunches 4x25  **DAY 4** Legs Weighted Lunges 4x20 (20 each leg) Barbell Squats 5x10 Leg press 5x20 Leg extension/ Leg Curl Superset 5x12 Light Weight Front Squat 3x12 Hanging Windmills 3x10  **DAY 5** Circuit Day/HIIT Day 10 minutes biking high speed Jump rope 2 minutes with 30 second rests in between up to 20 minutes. Box jumps 4x15 Burpees until failure for 5 sets. **EDIT** I have several video requests, and I'd love to share my video with you guys, but sadly it's against reddit rules to link youtube videos! If you want to see it, you can pm me, or you can try to be a reddit detective and find it haha. Thanks again for the support all! Also, I'm still continuing my cut through to the end of the summer, so expect another post soon! **EDIT** Woke up to 3,000 upvotes! I love you guys. I've been reading some comments and notice some negativity towards my title. Here's my explanation for why I wrote it: For some people, myself included, gaming is as toxic as alcoholism. You cannot compare yourselves to others. You can only write your story and hope that it inspires others that are in the same situation as yourself. I'm not denouncing gamers. I absolutely love video games and still do. I also believe that everyone is in charge of their own lives and generalizing a group takes away from individuality. I'm sharing my personal story and my solution to my problem. Hope this clears up the confusion. Thanks for the support! **EDIT** Alright everyone, I loved replying and answer a lot of people's questions. I'll continue tomorrow. Feel free to PM me any questions, as I will definitely work my way through every single one!  **EDIT** Guys the game I play is league of legends (I still play don't worry)! LOL so all the Pobelter references are definitely hitting home. PM me for my IGN ;p ","Big transformation! I myself would consider myself in this catagory as well. I've been playing runescape since 2000... needless to say I got fully addicted. Now I'm going to the gym 5 days a week. Have been for about one or two months now. I notice a difference in myself as well as others noticing a difference. Nothing is better than when a girl you've been crushing on says ""have you been going to the gym?"" Now that you've made a huge difference I don't think you'll begin going back to the normal routine you used to be in.  Anyways. Goodluck m8 ",416
4rj513,"**Progress Pictures:** http://imgur.com/a/xFh6X **Background:** I have essentially coasted through life not caring about how I looked what so ever or what people thought of me, I was never involved in any kind of real life social activities and pretty much kept to myself. During my freshmen and sophomore years of college I was considered the ""hermit"" of the hall. I spent all of my free time playing online games and didn't do much socializing outside of what I did online. I was never depressed or felt bad about myself, quite the contraire I had and still have rather high self-esteem and I will always look back on my online experiences with a smile. But one day I just felt like I had been throwing the best years of my life away, seemed like I had been missing the college experience and I needed to do something so that I could enjoy my life as a young college student while I still could, I hadn't even kissed a girl at this point. Granted I still thoroughly enjoy playing online games but I felt like maybe I should make a change so I don't live with regret for the rest of my life, so I did. I still have a long ways to go, the end goal is the whole package, 6 pack/Adonis belt/nice arms/butt/etc all that jazz, but being a normal BMI for the first time in my life felt like a milestone, so I decided to share.  **How did it start?** I had thought about losing weight for a rather long time, I just never felt like it could be accomplished easily, not to mention my entire family was overweight and I felt like I would be judged on my path to becoming a better me. Granted it originally was, losing weight was thrown around as a ""joke"" for about a week or two, but as I hit the gym literally every day they got far more serious and very supportive. But the major factor was that I managed to run into a girl online who was very supportive of me, she helped me start my journey (we had known each other about 3 weeks before I had actually started my weight loss). Thank you if you are reading this, I am forever indebted to you. **What I did to lose the weight:** It started very simple with no real set schedule, ""go to the gym and do cardio"" and it honestly hasn't really changed much. I still do not have set days in which I do certain exercises but I have managed to branch out into doing more upper body exercises and core, I still have completely disregarded my legs as it is very important that I am able to do cardio daily. At some point I do need to start doing real routines like squats/deadlifts/etc, but I'm still trying to lose some more weight before I make a change into the building muscle portion of my goal, not to mention I have no idea how to even start working on ""gains"". When I first started I felt like a fool, I would just use the treadmill in a gym packed full of good looking college students and just walk/run until I hit 500 calories. It felt embarrassing running my fat ass on a treadmill and it would often take over an hour but I always felt good afterwards so I continued to do it. I also started to track my calories as well as I could given my laziness, set the aggressive goal of 2lbs a week on myfitnesspal and never counted the calories burned at the gym as food I could eat, working out was simply a bonus or a padding for when I slipped. I wanted to lose a lot of weight, and I wanted to do it as fast as possible. I dropped 20lbs within the first month and hit my first plateau, this is when I made the first real change to the food I was eating to get back on track. I originally was still eating crap, just less of it. I made the move from the foods I enjoyed to mostly just chicken and some steamed vegetables to get over my hump, I still ate things I considered delicious here and there but my diet consisted mostly of cooked boneless skinless chicken breast often with a low calorie condiment. I was getting stronger and my heart was becoming more used to my routines, so every time something became too easy I made it difficult again. Went from 500 to 700 to 1000 to 1200 calories a day over the course of the next 4 months, just running and doing really heavy incline on the treadmill. This was supplemented with upper body weight machines and in the most recent month an ab routine that takes about 30 min. When I first started I was at the gym for nearly 3-4 hours a day, doing cardio and upper body and some days when I felt like I had slipped in terms of what I was eating I would go and commit seppuku the next day. Disciplining myself for being so lenient in my diet, I would be there for an entire afternoon, leave at 12pm-1pm and would return between 6pm-7pm. The one guy I do know personally at the gym from one of my university classes thinks I overwork myself sometimes, but I really wanted progress and I wanted it as fast as possible.   **What I do now:** I honestly have slipped significantly in terms of my super aggressive routine, I'm still adhering to 2lbs a week, but that feels rather lackluster compared to the weight loss I was initially feeling. But I suppose it's acceptable as it does become harder to lose weight as you become thinner. For the last month I normally attend the gym 5-6 times a week for 2-3 hours, I take the weekends off typically to play an abnormal amount of online games and spend time with my newfound girlfriend since the gym times are not ideal for me on the weekends. For when I do go, I start with doing upper body for about an hour, normally the same core machines, bicep curl/chest press/tricep press/etc, I consider these rather relaxing and rather enjoyable. I currently abide by the ""stronglift"" style of doing 5x5 of rather heavy weights and pushing my upper body to near failure when I do them sometimes. Then every other day I do my ab routine, I used to do it daily but I'm at the point where I'm actually getting sore doing them and its very cool seeing the progress I'm making in that category so I do give myself a little time to heal now. Finally I do cardio for 800-1000 calories every time I go depending on how much time I've given myself before I need to be somewhere, normally takes about an hour and I do 95% of my cardio doing incline. Feels like low impact and I pour sweat, during the more intense presets on the treadmill my heart rate averages out at around 160 - 170 bpm according to the heart monitor on it. There are times where I just can't go on any further and I need to pull off the intensity, but I always keep myself above 140.  **Major points:** It's not easy, there is no fast way, I'm very fortunate in my life to be able to work out so often to achieve my goals a little bit faster than normal. You need to find some sort of motivation to get yourself started, but you need to develop that into discipline to keep yourself going, even today I still don't want to go to the gym I would rather stay home and play games, but I'm not going to accomplish anything doing that in terms of my physical goals so I'm going regardless. Weight loss is also very very much so 80% diet 20% exercise, I'm currently eating around 1300 calories a day and every time I've plateaued or hit a rut is because I don't adhere to a strict diet. You have to eat better period, protein is king and starch/fiber foods are awesome. I still struggle with having hunger and I occasionally cave and dive into a delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a glass of milk and a serving of chips, but seriously eating a plate of broccoli or a single potato with nothing on it makes hunger go away like magic. It might not taste the greatest but it will curb your thirst for food instantly.  If I can do it, you can do it, stop saying that you're going to do it someday and start now. If you want it bad enough you will make it happen. I can assure you looking back on everything I have done, it's definitely worth it and the progress feels great. **TLDR** Lots and lots of cardio, watched calories and tried to stay within 1300-1500 calories. Other than that, nothing was really structured and I just did whatever I felt like at the gym that day. Also apologies for the wall of text and no set daily routine, there wasn't any unfortunately, i just did cardio based on a calorie burned mentality.   **Edit 1** Thank you all for the supportive comments!!! Much appreciated, ill answer all the questions I can so ask away or PM me. Im also well aware that my hair this morning does look rather awful, i just have gotten lazy when it comes to grooming if I know im staying in today, outside of going to the gym. Hair from 2 months ago http://imgur.com/hzZ24dn Although I do appreciate the hairstyle comments and suggestions as I personally have no idea what im doing in that regard. **Edit 2** My bpm really is around 45, just lucky I suppose. Managed to find the doctors office visit document from a few weeks back for proof, folded up to protect my information http://imgur.com/OtVuh6v They actually did it twice since she didn't believe the first one haha **Edit 3** Thank you everyone so much for your kind words!!! also thanks for my first post over 2k upvotes haha. Im starting a real weight routine tomorrow and ill be back in 6 months to let you guys know how I have been :) I also tried to make sure i responded to everyone's questions. Feel free to message me any if you have them, I always read all the comments and try to make sure I respond to everyone I can.

It was honestly one of the worst periods of time in my life so far. My dad developed Limbic Encephalitis, my brother developed testicular cancer, and my grandpa died of a brain tumor all within about a year. All of this was too much to handle and, long story short, I felt like food was the one thing I could control in my life. I always felt cold, alone and empty from anorexia. I woke up and would basically be a zombie, walking from one place to the next. I obsessed over food and calories way too much. This knowledge of food and calories actually came into use once I started lifting, but for this period of time it was too much to worry about. I was 13/14 and thinking about how many calories I was eating in a day – not good. **Anorexia Recovery**: * I can confidently say that it wasn’t until my sophomore year of college (when I started lifting for the first time) that I was able to recover from anorexia. I went through nutritionists and therapists for years. Through everything, my parents were the biggest help, and were (and still are) my biggest encouragers when I started lifting and gaining weight. === **My first year of lifting (December 2014-December 2015)** 	 * I was motivated to find a way to help me gain weight. I played tennis in high school, which helped maintain weight. I knew that doing something like tennis (an activity) would help me gain weight.  It was hard at first. I was moving toward full recovery around when I started lifting, but it was still difficult to eat everything I needed to. As a result, I didn’t do everything right for the first half year of lifting. I ate too little, worked out too much, and was way too stressed. I didn’t even have a routine I followed, I just did what one of my friends told me to do in the gym and didn’t get anywhere with it. I did this for about the first six months of working out. * After six months of messing around, I landed on PPL as my first official routine. I honestly think I picked PPL because a hypertrophy-based program seemed safer to me. Big lifts were intimidating to me at this point, and PPL seemed like a good mixture of accessory stuff and big lifts (and was getting good reception at the time). I probably should have started with SS. PPL was great, but was a bit too much for how much I WASN’T eating. * The PPL Routine that I used was Coolcicada’s routine WITH deadlifts mixed in. It was a consistent Push, Pull, Legs – Push, Pull, Legs – Rest (PPLPPLR). I ended up doing way too much volume, but it’s what got me comfortable with the major lifts. I ended up doing this routine for about the next six months. === **After 1 year/ Up to now**: * After the first full year, I knew that I wasn’t eating enough and that I needed to eat more in order to NOT waste the time I was putting into lifting. I absolutely loved lifting at this point in time – coming into the gym every day to challenge myself. To improve, to get better at something I loved was what brought me back to most days.  * I watched videos, frequented r/fitness and did my best to work on form, eating big and lifting big. I had started to count calories again, but instead of counting calories to lose weight (like before), I was counting calories to gain weight. * I began doing Arnold’s Blueprint after the first year. I decided to do it just to do something different – to do something more fun. It was great to mix things up, but was pretty hard to keep track of my lifting numbers. * I saw another Redditor’s progress post while looking at r/fitness one day and saw him mention Lazar Angelev’s routine. I was looking honestly for something I wouldn’t have to stress out too much about (was working on finals in college when I was looking to switch routines) and saw this workout as a pretty good option, just to mix things up, which brings me to today. I saw a post yesterday about Jacked and Tan 2.0 that interested me - I'll probably give it a shot once classes start again. I know I have so much to improve on - my lifts are, for the most part, pretty weak, and I want to work on that. I am happy that lifting was able to help me get out of a pretty rough patch in life, but now look forward to actually getting **stronger.**  --- ---  ***Diet***: === * Anorexia recovery got me in touch with a lot of nutritionists. Through this I was able to learn a ton about nutrition, calories, macros, etc. I learned a lot during this time that contributed to a growing knowledge of necessary diet and nutrition today. * I started eating not enough when I was lifting. I wasn’t losing weight, but wasn’t gaining any at a good rate. I was basically maintaining but didn’t even realize it. * When I got more serious about gaining weight, I found IIFYM. Started hitting a 40/40/30 Split each day. I weighed myself every morning, took the average at the end of the week, and repeated that, comparing my weights at the end of each week to see how much weight I was gaining. I still try to follow this as best I can, but haven’t done it as frequently since the summer started. * I’m a student living on my own over the summer, trying to manage slow-bulking on a budget. I am attempting to eat about 3,000 calories per day: ~165g Protein, ~400g Carbs, ~80g Fat. A typical day right now would look like: o	Breakfast: * 3 Eggs, ½ Cup Oatmeal, Banana, Yogurt, ½ Cup Cottage Cheese, Peanut Butter === o	Lunch: Something like stir-fry or Mexican-style * Lotta Rice * Lotta Chicken * Veggies * Tortilla Wrap * Greek Yogurt * Peanut Butter === o	Shake after Workout: * 2/3 Cup Milk * 1 Scoop Protein Powder * ½ Cup Oats * Peanut Butter * Cocoa Powder === o	Dinner:  * Pasta/ Potatoes * Chicken/ Beef * Broccoli * More Peanut Butter * More tortillas === o	Snacks: * Nuts, granola, oatmeal, more peanut butter --- ---  **Other things**: === I know I haven’t don’t everything right. There is still a TON for me to learn, and I don’t want to pretend like I know everything. I’ve tried my best to learn from and stick to the wisdom that everyone’s offered on reddit and in the gym. Some of the most important things I’ve learned on this journey and from these people are: * This is a marathon, not a sprint.  *  Healthy consistency has been super important for me, especially coming from a disease that feeds off of unhealthy consistency. There are days that I don’t get to lift, but as long as I stick to a thought-out diet and exercise, in the long run the goals that I have will be reached. * Lifting isn’t everything  * At first I replaced my under-eating with lifting, which led to pretty unhealthy lifting behavior. Instead of planning my day around lifting, I started planning lifting around my day. I haven’t dropped my relationships or hobbies to lift – I’ve simply picked up lifting as a means to living a healthy lifestyle, which works for me. * Discipline  * Discipline is what keeps me going when I motivation gets low. Some days (though few) I don’t want to go into the gym – it’s discipline that keeps me going and striving towards the goals that I have. If you have a goal and are trying to reach something – in lifting, life, relationships, job, etc. – keep on fighting for it. This journey has been an incredible one, and I look forward to what this next season brings.  === --- **Thank you for encouraging me and helping me beat this anorexia thing, reddit! I couldn’t have done it without a lot of people, but certainly couldn’t have done it without you. If you have any advice – anything I need or should work on, please let me know. Keep on supporting, posting, mirin', working out and living life to its fullest.** == **TLDR: Anorexia = bad, food = Good.** = *Edit: Holy poop, thank you everyone for your encouraging words and support. I've come back to find so much encouragement and a ton of people who are, or who have been, in a similar spot. One of the biggest things i've seen people asking about is if they have anorexia or if it means they're anorexic if they were at the same body weight as me - this isn't necessarily true. Anorexia is very much a mental disorder - I knew guys when I was 110lbs that were the same weight as me. They, however, did not have anorexia. Why? Because our mindsets were completely different. My mindset was so focused on restricting calories and obsessed with body image, while the other guy's was not. It's a mindset that made me anorexic, not the body weight.  Seriously, you're all awesome. If you need anything, or have any more questions, let me know. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can. Anorexia's a deep and dark place - it takes loving/caring people to help get out of it. ",You look good OP. Well done. ,193

4sc2o8,"Sorry for the lack of more before pictures, I was super insecure about my weight and didn't let photos be taken of me. Looking to lean out to about 15%, so advice would be appreciated! http://imgur.com/a/Gr6go I'm about 5'2, 14 in the first photo and 16 in all the others.  I became overweight around age 10 and got steadily bigger from there. At the end of middle school I developed depression for a multitude of reasons, but one of the results of this was a bout with anorexia. The actual weight loss took only about 3-4 months because of that. Since then I've been attempting to heal by maintaining a healthy diet and building up some muscle, but every once in a while have periods where eating will become a problem for me again. I currently eat around 1300 calories a day to maintain my weight (I have a very slow metabolism). Edit: apparently I have to include my diet and routines! As I mentioned previously, the initial weight loss was a result of an eating disorder, so I don't have much advice on that. However, I can tell you about what I do to maintain it now. With my diet I'm very strict. My macros usually end up around 35% protein, 30% fat, and 35% carbs. I do follow a pescetarian diet, which leads me to eat some pretty crazy stuff to get all that protein without most meat. Egg whites, salmon, whey protein, and tuna are pretty frequent. If I had to recommend some specifics, Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard whey is great in any flavor and Mission1 Protein bars are amazing. I eat around 1300 calories a day, as mentioned earlier, and am constantly carb cycling. 35% carbs for 2 days, 50-55% for 1, repeat. I wouldn't recommend this diet to everyone, as it is affected by aforementioned eating disorder. 2 times a week, I do legs. The first day is sets of 3x5 reps of the heaviest weight I can manage (for all exercises). These include squats (currently doing around 115 pounds, I lost a lot of muscle when I lost weight), leg press, prone leg curl, leg extension, abductor and adductor. For cardio I sometimes throw in 15-20 minutes on the stairs. I generally don't do full days dedicated to arms/chest/back because I already get a decent workout while doing archery training, but when I do I only use machines, almost never free weights. I use the shoulder press, chest press, lat pulldown, bicep curl, tricep extension, chinups and dips. These are all with 5 sets of 10-12 reps, about 10 pounds below the maximum of what I can do. On these days I eat less carbs, but I'm not sure that makes any difference. At the beginning AND end of each workout, I do 10 minutes of 30sec HIIT sprints with 30sec walks in between. This has been probably the biggest factor in getting my body fat down when I was stuck around 23%.  It's hard to me to think of everything I do off the top of my head so feel free to send me a message if you have a question!  Edit 2: I get it, you think I look fine now. Thanks.

4smj3z,"Found [this](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/07/160712094259.htm) article about a new research study to be very interesting.   Crux of it all:  >""Fatigue is the great equalizer here,"" says Stuart Phillips, senior author on the study and professor in the Department of Kinesiology. ""Lift to the point of exhaustion and it doesn't matter whether the weights are heavy or light."" **EDIT:** Not saying I agree or disagree with this research; just found it to be interesting. I personally think this would be true for certain body types and certain people, but probably not all. For me, I believe a version of this might be true, more so because I'm just trying to maintain at this point and am able to do that with lower weights (with higher reps for exhaustion). My background: mid-30s. Played high school and college sports (crew, rugby). Worked out consistently throughout undergrad and grad school.   Since then, have tried to stick to a regimen. At this point I do gym 3 times a week, rest day in between each, with cardio day thrown in one day over the weekend. I stick to combos of pairing a major muscle group, with minor per workout. And I rarely increase weights anymore. Usually do 4 sets with 12-15 reps of (what I consider) lighter weights for most exercises.   I've been able to maintain a sculpted look throughout the years; 6'2"", 170lbs, 41"" chest, 30"" waist.   Again, not saying it would work for everyone, just my opinion and perspective. Being human, I might just be lucky in life/body and attributing it to my regimen.",That's cool but you'll be doing a very long workout if you use light weights!,997
4spcwv,"Hey guys! Nick E here! Following some demand from this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/4rskz0/is_there_a_list_of_exercises_to_test_mobility_so/d543zvq I decided to start up on a project for making a guide that makes it so anyone could easily spend 15-20 minutes assessing themselves and get a good idea of where their mobility is lacking, or if they have any imbalances. I figured it might be appropriate to share here as in fitness its important to have balanced mobility to avoid injury. #LINK HERE: http://www.nick-e.com/mobility-assessment/ ##Summary:## Not going to list all the tests and assessments on here as they are better explained in the article with pictures and whatnot, but here's a list of all the articulations tested: * Shoulder Flexion * Shoulder Extension * External Shoulder Rotation * Internal Shoulder Rotation  * Wrist Flexion/Extension * Finger Flexion/Extension * Internal Hip Rotation * External Hip Rotation * Hip Abduction * Hip Extension * Straight Leg Hip Flexion (Pike) * Bent Leg Hip Flexion (Squat) * Ankle Dorsiflexion For each articulation I propose a test, explain the pass/fail, and propose possible causes of the failure, in terms of particular muscles being tight or weak. I would explain in more detail to summarise, but its hard to do so without literally writing out the entire article, which would take up lots of space and wouldn't be nearly as helpful without the pictures haha. **OTHER STUFF** This is just kinda step 1 of this project. I wanted to get this out cos this was just the most explicitly demanded aspect. In future I'm going to add a section that directs you to resources that directly address each of the issues listed, so once you identify a problem, you can immediately go about formulating a solution to it! After that I'm going to make a youtube video for each accompanying articulation/assessment to go along with the article, as in the original suggestion, some people did want a video, but its such a big topic I've realised one video just isn't gonna cut it! What do you guys think of the assessment? Does anyone have any suggestions  to alter it to improve it? Did I miss anything important that should be assessed? **EDIT 1:** Lots of people are asking to be notified or to post again once I've updated everything. The videos and 'how to fix' section will be coming quite step by step. If you want to wait for the full update post, be warned, it will take a while! If you want to see the updates as they come, just check out my channel, cos I won't be putting them all into the article til' they are all finished! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5ygTs_puiGKvyw47UCBVA (MODS, PLEASE PM IF ME POSTING A LINK TO MY CHANNEL IS AGAINST THE RULES AND I WILL REMOVE IT, I READ THEM THROUGH BUT DIDNT SEE ANYTHING SAYING I COULDNT.

Does this mean you always have to take a 3 minute rest break? No I think it just shows if you go over a minute you aren't going to lose your training effect. Edit: for clarification, anecdotally many of us have been practicing this longer rest period to ensure completion of reps at a given weight. With regards to research there have been very few <5 studies on this topic. This helps to create a justification and scientific basis for what we've been doing. ",Kind of obvious IMO. If volume is standardized then resting longer allows me to do the same number of reps with a heavier weight. Only problem is your workouts start to take 2 hours long. Not exactly rocket science though. ,1168
4uu2jh,"I spent a weekend down at my brothers and that's when I saw it.   I saw a picture of myself which ruined my day.... I never realised how fat I was, maybe it was a bad angle as a smaller person took the picture but I thought ""that's it, im taking my diet more seriously"".    I was 106 kilos (234lbs) when I started my diet and Im a 6 foot 2 guy who's 27.   Well, I say started my diet but I had been dieting for a year, but I never lost any weight over that year.   I would always lose a little over the week but then put it all back on at the weekend when I would go out drinking one night. This kept on hapening until I finally thought ""is drinking really worth it?""   So I downloaded myfitnesspal, tracked all my calories, ate around 1900 calories a day, avoided alcohol completely, (it wasnt just the calories in the alcohol that was the problem, its that I always end up at a fast food place at 3am with no recolection of how I got there which ruins my diet), eat sweets less, and I work part time in a factory. I tracked my steps and it said I walked around 15000 steps one day just at work, and that was a fairly slow day, and im also always constantly moving and carrying heavy things like microwaves and vacuum cleaners etc.   So now 45 days later im 89 kilos (196.5lbs) and I feel so much better about myself. lost 37.5lbs if that makes more sense (ironically used kg in the title to make things less confusing as we use pounds and stone in the UK).   And I never realised how many benifits there would be to stopping drinking. I can now stay awake past midnight if im out with my friends, I dont get hangovers, feel really hydrated as I just drink pepsi max (diet pepsi) all night, I remember the night, still laugh as much as I would if I was drinking, and Ive saved a shitload of money.   I didnt think the weight could come off that fast. I went to the doctor to talk about it and they said that my thyroid was a tiny bit high but the thing that controlls my thyroid was normal. So they said it wasnt anything to worry about. They also tested me for diabetes and scanned my heart and saw everything was fine.   Yesterday a guy who used to work at my job came to visit, the last time I saw him was at the christmas party.      I said hi to him and he completely ignored me, I thought about how ignorant it was and it really annoyed me. But then later when I was working in the distance I heard him say ""That was Alex!?! He looks brand new!!!"" Haha.   Just to clarify, I mentioned something like this a week ago here asking if it was normal but because I wrote it in pounds instead of kilos and never gave information about my age, gender, starting weight etc all the messages were just people confused but they reccomended I went to a doctor to check it out.   Edit; added some info like lbs instead of kilos etc.  Because of popular demand heres a before and after pic    https://imgur.com/v6SjI3q","Good work I'm in a very similar boat as you. 6,2 tall but my weight was 118.4 managed to lose 22.4kgs in just under 3 months.

All I did was track how many carbs I would eat, aimed to stay below 40g a day. lost 80lbs this way. Year 2: Starvation. ate 0-500cals a day. lost about 40lbs this way In a few months. hated it. don't do it haha.  Year 2.5/Current: Macros. 2k cals, 200g protein 200g carbs, 45g fats. LOVE THIS! Not only do I get to eat all types of food, I eat for fuel! nothing I eat goes to waste... if I don't workout that day, I don't eat as much. I recommend doing this due to how you don't hate life on this diet.  Gym: Mondays back. Tuesday chest. Wednesday legs. Thursday shoulders. Friday arms.

4wgai3,"* I recently published a comprehensive guide for people who have never heard of the keto diet or want to know more. This was very well received [on /r/keto](https://redd.it/4vhrv5) and I'm sure /r/fitness would benefit as well from this information because diet is one of the most powerful and effective changes we could make to manage our health. * **I tried to do my best to make sure I portrayed this diet in a responsible, well-rounded manner with all the pros/cons so here goes:** ###Link: [All About the Keto Diet: A Beginners Guide](http://antranik.org/keto-diet/) Edit: The post was removed due to some [self-promotion rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/self_promotion)  SO I must adhere to them by probably summarizing the content of a 9000 word article. Okay so here goes: ###What is the ketogenic (keto) diet? The ketogenic diet is not intended to be a temporary diet for weight loss, although it works great for that, but it is more of a lifestyle change where you consistently and drastically reduce the amount of carbs you ingest. It not only makes you burn fat for energy (more on that below) but helps you become very aware of how rampant and ubiquitous carbs are in this day and age. ###Why is it called ketogenic? * The word ketogenic is made up of two words: keto- and -genic. * The prefix “keto-” is short for ketones. * The suffix “-genic” is the same as genesis, which refers to “the creation of something” * So the word ketogenic literally means the “creation of ketones.” * Ketones are created from the break down of fat for energy when the body doesn’t get enough carbs. * When the body is creating ketones, it is said to be in a state of ketosis where fat becomes the main source of fuel for energy rather than sugar (glycolysis). ###What the fuck are ketones? Ketones are like water-soluble fat molecules that can cross the blood-brain-barrier and provide energy for the brain.  There is this myth where people say that you MUST eat carbs because the brain can only survive off carbs or glucose. What they don’t know (or conveniently forget to mention) is that the brain operates perfectly on ketones as well.  Think of them as the 4th macronutrient after carbs, protein and fat. ### How is ketosis achieved? Ketosis is achieved by practicing strict carbohydrate restriction consistently. The general limit is about 25-50grams of net carbs a day which is far lower than the typical 200-300grams most people ingest per day.  (Net carbs are carbs minus fiber.) Those carbs must be replaced with healthy fat sources. It takes a few days for ketosis to actually occur because you have a glycogen supply to get through initially, but one can reach ketosis faster if they exercise. Note: One can also reach ketosis if they starve themselves completely of all foods, but that is not ideal or recommended. What we're after is not starvational ketosis but nutritional ketosis which is achieved in the same fashion by simply restricting carbs. ###What are the benefits of being in ketosis? The promises of a ketogenic diet are quite impressive: * Helpful for metabolic syndrome (obesity) and preventing diabetes * Increased meal satiety and appetite blunting. This diet is more satiating than a low-fat diet and tends to makes it easier to avoid caloric overconsumption. * Greater rate of fat loss due to state of ketosis rather than glycolysis. * Note: You literally become a fat-burning machine. * Reduction or complete elimination of Type-2 Diabetes (Reduction in insulin resistance) * Reduction or complete elimination of hypertension (high blood pressure). * Improved lipid fat profile: LDL (the bad cholesterol) particle size increases which is a good thing. (The smaller ones cause more damage.)  * [The SIZE of LDL particles may be more important than concentration of LDL cholesterol.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20531184)  * Recent studies have shown independent relationships of levels of LDL size to risk of heart disease. * [Prevention of various cancers and reduction of cancer growths.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267662/#!po=0.217391)  * The mitochondria of cancer cells are damaged and require 200x the normal amounts of glucose to replicate at rapid rates. They cannot utilize ketones and cannot survive in ketosis without the presence of excess glucose. * [Possible treatment for Alzheimers.](http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1743-7075-6-31.pdf) ([another study\)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19090989) * [Possible treatment for Parkinsons](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15728303) * [Improved memory for older adults](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21130529) * [Reduction or complete elimination of chronic systemic inflammation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267662/#!po=0.217391) * A ketogenic diet has profoundly anti-inflammatory effects. * [Improved cardiovascular health](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/132/7/1879.abstract) * Very high muscle-sparing effect.

You can extrapolate that if it’s helping reverse the diseased conditions of people with Type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and so forth, that it may PROACTIVELY help those of us who are not afflicted by those conditions and want to avoid them! ###Before I continue: The ketogenic diet is NOT a panacea The truth is that there is not a single, perfect diet that works for everybody.  In regards to this diet specifically, [Dom D’agostino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWRnma8Tet0) says that this diet is excellent for ~70% of people out there but ~30% of the population does not respond well to this diet. Btw, Dom D’agostino is the expert that originally got me hooked to trying keto. He calls ketones the 4th macronutrient in[ this podcast with Tim Ferris.](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/11/03/dominic-dagostino/) * Weight loss is NOT guaranteed on keto. You still need to be wary of your total intake of calories and counting your calories/macros is recommended until you figure out the diet. But after a lot of experience, many people find the keto diet to be liberating because they are able to maintain the diet without the need for calorie counting by consistently choosing only keto-friendly foods. ###Why do you have to restrict the carbs so sharply? How does the body transition to burning fats for energy? I wrote a ton on that topic and I'm just summarizing here so here's a tl;dr infographic: http://i.imgur.com/HeEYexT.png ###So… What are carbohydrates? Carbs are sugar. Sugars are carbs.  There are simple carbs (monosaccharides) and complex carbs (polysaccharides). There are also sugars found naturally in foods and extra sugars added artificially to foods. In the context of a ketogenic diet, they’re all pretty much the same because the body eventually breaks them down into their simplest forms regardless. (The carbs that you will eat will come almost entirely from veggies or nuts on this diet.) ### Don't we need carbs for energy? * Despite your body needing to break down carbs first and foremost when they are ingested, carbs are NOT an essential nutrient.  An essential nutrient is one your body needs to survive because it won’t be able to make it on its own.  But your body readily creates sugar from fat and protein to regulate blood sugar levels. * Many people think they need carbs to perform at their very best performance-wise, but that’s not true either. It takes a few weeks, but after someone becomes completely adapted to the ketogenic diet, they become very, very efficient at burning fats for fuel and the bandwidth or throughput within which your body can do this at is great. It’s been ingrained in us that we need carbs to survive, or perform at our peak as athletes. We see sugar as energy. We see athletes drink Gatorade, so we think we can’t perform at our best without it. We almost rely on it as a crutch. But when you’re keto-adapted you are not chained to the hypoglycemic rollercoaster. **I'm only a quarter way through the article and it's only summarized the key points but the rest of the article talks about**  * What's wrong with carbs * Which foods are high in carbs: all grains/bread, rice, pasta, cereal, starchy veggies, potato chips, vegetable chips, pita chips, cookies, crackers, ice cream, pudding, cakes, donuts, soft drinks (none of it!) and fruits/fruit juices (except berries and avocados). * A rebuttal to people who say, ""I like food too much."" * How to calculate how many NET carbs a food has (total carbs minus fiber) * What to eat if you don't eat carbs? * How sustainable is such a relatively restrictive diet? How do you eat out? * Can you get all the proper nutrients off of it? How does one create a well formulated keto diet? * Isn't this diet expensive? * What are all the pros/cons of this diet? * Progress pics   * **calories in/out only:** [eating at a simple deficit in 2013, I lost fat AND muscle](http://i.imgur.com/VRZuLsa.jpg)  * **keto only:** [but on the keto diet, because it is muscle sparing, I lost fat AND retained muscle](http://i.imgur.com/FImPVTe.jpg) * **Again, this was only an abridged version of the whole thing. If you want to read the full article with photos and full text, go here: [All About the Keto Diet: A Beginners Guide](http://antranik.org/keto-diet/)** * And please remember that diets are an extremely complex subject. There is no perfect diet and it's not all about just doing something for weight loss. Diet is influenced by culture, religion, social influence, family, ethics... for some it's as simply as drinking soylent and nothing more. For some, they view it through a lens of biochemistry and physiology and geek out over metabolically hacking their body. It's all about finding out what works for you. On the keto diet, I was able to sleep well and have good recovery between strength/skill training sessions and felt a constant state of mental focus (I still do, I've been keto for like 3 months straight now with 5 months total experience), so it's nice to be able to share what it's all about, in case it jives with anyone.

4x8f27,"Hey athletes of /r/fitness, Have you ever wanted to learn a strict/clean muscle up? A few years ago, I did, but didn’t know how to go about learning one. A lot of muscle-up tutorial videos I saw in the past missed out on important key tips that helped me personally. I have been asked how I got mine to be clean many times, and today I share an in-depth 5-minute tutorial with you to hopefully help you towards achieving one. #**Video Link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKdGQXyGgZU The **two biggest tips** I would recommend when you obtain the strength to do a muscle up are the following: **1**) Utilizing a thumbless grip to make it easier to pull yourself over the bar **2**) Pulling yourself slightly away from the bar and creating separation once you develop sufficient strength to do explosive pull-ups. This video is focused around the **principle of specificity** (what I did to accomplish a muscle-up), which is just a concept that you what you do in the gym should be related to your goals.  The movements I focused on most were similar to the muscle up itself– lat pulldowns → pull-ups → weighted pull-ups. In my opinion, the biggest key to getting a clean muscle up is by getting strong on your pull-ups and doing them with explosiveness and proper form. Sticking within the 1 – 5 rep range and focusing on explosion and strength development can be very beneficial.  It is also very important to focus on retracting the scapula and creating a stable shoulder when doing pulling movements to prevent shoulder injury. This focus on scapular retraction will also help you increase your back strength and allow for quicker progression to the muscle-up. Once you master the pull-up and can easily explode to get your chest around bar level, utilizing a band can really assist you in grooving the muscle up movement. If you don’t have a band, you can also jump into the movement with a lower bar or practice negatives/eccentric muscle ups. Again, specificity is key and while there are many other great back exercises, focusing on the listed movements will be most helpful in achieving your muscle-up goals.  ##Feel free to share this video with friends/anyone you think it may help who is interested in this movement. I truly hope it helps you! I have some questions for you guys as well to start a discussion. If the interest is there, I’ll be happy to answer questions through this post (they don't have to be muscle-up related).  1) Have you ever tried doing a muscle up? 2) How many pull-ups did you do before getting to a muscle up (if you have done one?) 3) How many pull-ups can you currently do? 4) What do you enjoy more? Calisthenics, physique/bodybuilding or powerlifting? 5) Why do you want to learn a muscle up?

I was never a student-athlete, but I always admired how they managed to balance their workload with the demands of college athletics. Now, several years out of college and working in healthcare, I'm realizing how difficult it is to ensure a balance between caring for yourself and being a workaholic.  **So, to all the busy professionals out there: How do you do it? How do you motivate yourself to protect your fitness time and put in the energy and resources to become a better version of yourself?** Is it determination, prioritization, being OK with not working so much, etc?","Very few people are literally so busy that they can't find time to workout 45-60 minutes at least 3 times per week. Aside from single parents, most don't have good excuses.  It's about priorities. Everyone has them. Some people enjoy watching TV or reading or playing video games or going out with friends during the few hours per day they have to relax. Others dedicate time to another hobby - fitness. Because that's really what it is; a hobby.  Personally, I go to bed slightly earlier and hit the gym in the AM before work. This means I have evenings free to spend with my girlfriend, dogs, other hobbies, etc. It also means that when random things come up and I get busy, they aren't likely to impact gym time since I already took care of it in the morning. Most people have spare time in their weeks, even if they work long hours and have a family. But it's just about how we choose to spend those hours. Fitness is just another hobby that you can choose to devote time to, but it'll typically involve trading off time you could spend on a different hobby. It's not difficult and there's no secret. Busy people still have hobbies.",3569
4yjwx1,"Hey everyone!  I posted here a year back and thought I would share my progress once again as well as how and why I did it for any newcomers to this subreddit. I really hope that this helps someone, if it helps anyone at all it will have been worth the effort of typing this long spiel.   For most of my life I have suffered from depression and anxiety, even from the age of 8 I can remember being depressed. I had been on a variety of anti-depressants and I never really liked how they made me feel, I'm sure if I stuck with them I could have found one that worked for me but I just didn't like them so decided to live without.   A little over 3 years ago I ended up going to therapy as my depression was affecting my relationship(s) in a very negative way. I expressed that I really didn't want to go on anti-depressants or anything again and my therapist kept recommending exercising to me, insisting that I join a gym. It took me like 6 or more sessions to finally listen to her and joined a gym, only to prove to her that she was wrong and it wouldn't help.  I absolutely hated it at first, everything about it. I had terrible anxiety anytime I would walk in the door. I hated the million mirrors everywhere, I felt like everyone was judging me for obviously having no idea what I was doing. I kept at it though, in order to prove my therapist wrong. Eventually I started to not hate it, and then surprisingly I noticed I actually looked forward to going to the gym.   A little over three years later and here I am. I went from severely depressed, doing literally nothing ever. I would wake up 20 minutes before work, come home and sit on the couch for 5 hours only to sleep another 11-12 hours and then repeat. My diet consisted of fast food and junk food, no wonder I felt like shit all the time.   Now I wake up at 5:30am every day, go to yoga, go to work, go to the gym, come home and make a healthy dinner, hang out with my soon-to-be husband/animals and go to bed.   My physical progress: Stomach: http://i.imgur.com/ClDG4Pu.jpg Back: http://i.imgur.com/Q6GeWHA.jpg Arms: http://i.imgur.com/bt37N6d.jpg Nutrition: I basically eat the same things every day, mainly out of laziness and a hatred for cooking. I know there are TONS of options out there for a healthy/fit lifestyle I am just far too lazy to make any of them, and I'm a shit cook as well so I keep it very simple.  Breakfast: 3 eggs, 1 cup of egg whites - scrambled with butter to grease the pan. Cup of coffee with full fat, full sugar cream because it's something I just don't want to cut out.   Snack: 500g plain greek yogurt, mixed with a handful of blended frozen strawberries, and a banana   Lunch: Turkey meatballs made with eggs, bread crumbs, onions and ground turkey. Not sure of the exact measurements but I eat 2lbs of it over the course of a week. Green smoothie with kale, spinach, mangoes, orange juice and water.   Dinner: Varies. Favourite meals include 2 tacos with lean ground beef in soft tortilla shells and veggies + salsa. Chicken quesadillas in the same, steak with potatoes and veggies or really any kind of meat with potatoes and veggies. On leg days I'll eat pasta.   Snack: Usually some fruit, cherries, grapes, apples are my faves. **** EDIT: forgot to add I have one scoop of bcaa's during every work out and one scoop of protein powder with water after every workout  I normally only eat like this during the week. On the weekends I am much more relaxed about my diet, I like to go out for dinner once a week. I like to drink wine sometimes. I don't deprive myself of anything, there are weekends I am really ""bad"" about the food I eat, and there are weekends where I'm pretty ""good"". Sometimes I get food guilt but I really try not to beat myself up about it because I know the majority of the time I eat well.   Work Outs: Monday - Glute focused leg day  * 5 sets of 12 - Split squats using the smith machine, start with 50lbs end up at 75lbs  * 5 sets of 15 - Glute bridges using the smith machine with increasing weight. currently start at 200lbs and end up at 300lbs  * 5 sets of 12 - squats - start at 60lbs end up at 90lbs hack squats  * 3 sets of 12 - hack squats - start at 80lbs end at 100lbs 6 sets of 12 - leg press - I do alternating between narrow and wide legs.

Sometimes I'll do 20+ minutes of high speed steps on the stepmill before my workout, lately i haven't done much cardio though cause I had bronchitis and never got back into it. But I will be starting that again so I can have better endurance for my longer hikes. When I first started out I did a full body routine 3x a week. I recommend that for beginners as if you start out with what I'm doing currently you will likely hate it and not want to go back. I love lifting because I love setting and breaking PR's, I love feeling strong, and I LOVE the way it makes me feel and look.  I realize now that no one was judging me when I first went to the gym, I do not judge anyone that goes there whether they are new or not. I respect everyone in there for making an effort to better themselves physically and mentally. Some days it is still a struggle to go, especially when I'm having an off day and feel the depression trying to take hold of me again. It's on those days that you need to exercise the most.  Anyway, if anyone reads this thank you! It was a loong post and I appreciate you for taking the time to read it. I wish everyone luck in their journey's!! ","Wow girl, you were just exactly the motivation I needed. My body is a bit similar to yours, not sure how tall you are, but I have made a commitment to myself to join my uni gym and I am going to follow your workout routine. Very glad it has also helped you with your anxiety and depression, I hope to be just as committed to it as you are. Plus I really like the fact you don't deprive yourself of anything but are still more than well capable of enjoying your weekend! Seriously kudos to you.

4yu4p4,"Hello Reddit!  I have lurked on /r/fitness for long enough and it's time to share my weight loss journey.  First things first.... BEFORE  https://m.imgur.com/a/y7Csk AFTER   https://m.imgur.com/a/2f531  WORK IDs (exactly 2 years apart)  https://m.imgur.com/a/V74ki  RE-CREATION PIC - http://imgur.com/L6e7qt1  The last 1.5 years I have been putting in some serious work.  I've had weight problems since about 16 years old due to lack of exercise,  terrible diet and excessive drinking.  I usually floated around 235-250, highest I've seen was 262 on the scale. On Jan. 1, 2015 at 3am, I realized I needed to this change immediately.   I quit drinking altogether and haven't had one drink since.  This was insanely difficult but I'll save it for another post.  Didn't change anything except the drinking and dropped to 225 in 6 months.  After losing some weight and gaining some confidence, I looked to include some exercise in my life.   I started small, running (walking) one mile a day on the treadmill at the YMCA near my house.  My first mile was 18 minutes slow walking and I barely made it without stopping; it was embarrassing to myself to say the least.  I was an athlete growing up and couldn't believe I fell this far into a hole.  I slowly changed my diet and was estimating calories around 1800 a day. At the time I ate lean pockets with salad and carrots on top.  I had no idea what I was doing but knew it was better than the fast food, pizza, and beer I had been slamming in the past. I got down to 205 on the lean pocket noob diet but hit a road block for about a month.  My mile time had dropped to 12-13 minutes and I knew it was time to add more to my routine.  I got sick of the treadmill and picked a route near my house that took about one hour to run/walk.  I didn't even measure the mileage, just did this route every single day.  About 2 months later I decided to GPS the route and it was 6.6 miles.  Ended up run/walking 6.6 miles for 49 days straight, I missed only one day.  I would run as far as I could, then walk, then run ect. This broke my plateau and I finally broke 200 and got to the 190 range.   I graduated from the lean pocket bs and started eating chicken,quinoa and eggs like a mad man.  My farts were absolutely terrible and still are.  By now I was 1 year into this and felt pretty good but knew I had more in me.  I bought a mountain bike and went on 10-20 mile trail/road rides 3 times a week.  In between days I would walk/run my normal route.  Plateaued again around 180-185. Fast forward a few months to today.  I am back on the treadmill and have a gym membership.  A couple days ago I ran my fastest mile at 6:15. I will break 6 minutes sometime this month.  I incorporated weight lifting into my routine for 40 min and finish it off with a 2 mile run(no walking this time) under 16 min.  My diet is now mostly chicken breast, quinoa, eggs, turkey sandwiches ,protein shakes, avocado ect (all the good shit).  I am currently trying to gain back some muscle I lost, aiming for 180lbs at 11-13 percent bf. This has been an insane journey but the single best decision I have made in my life.  I literally feel like I am 16 again and am in the best shape of my life.  The positive occurrences in my life far outweigh the negatives, where not long ago this was flip flopped. STOKED! Well that's my story!  My hope is that someone reads this and makes that change in their life that they've always wanted. Thanks Reddit!  Notes -I had 6 months off between contracts at work, this helped tremendously.  -Consistancy is king -Lacking on before pics (around 230-245 in pics).  Can't find any of my heaviest because I hated taking pictures. -Forgot about disc golf, awesome hobby for excercise.  I would play speed rounds and almost run the course. Fun/cardio is better then cardio. EDIT: Well I just woke up and holy shit. RIP INBOX.  Imma sort thru this and find a red bow tie.  Thanks all, this is unbelievable.

4zhz9y,"[My Transformation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkHKIj0MLoU) I was 43. A lifetime of obesity was taking it's toll on me. My health was failing, and my romantic life and social life were failing even harder. I had tried to lose weight many times, and failed as many times. So I gave up. And although I had given up on ever finding the girl of my dreams, I made the foolish mistake of falling hard for a girl, only to be rejected again, as I had been every time before. So, with a shattered heart, I took one more stab at it. I spent hours on Reddit every day. I turned to you guys for inspiration, motivation, and education. I spent most of my time in /r/fitness, /r/keto, /r/loseit, and /r/progresspics. You people became my motivator, my trainer, my nutrition coach, and my friends. And you changed my life. In every way I can possibly imagine. My life is the complete opposite of what it once was, and I have only you to thank for it. This post is my tribute to our community. It is my thank you to the best friends I have that I have never even met. I hope this post encourages and motivates you to move forward. Looking back now, I can clearly see that the only thing that ever stood in my way was my belief that there was nothing that I could do about it, so I never even tried. Please follow my example and don't give up on yourself. So how did I do it? My first breakthrough happened by chance. I watched the movie “Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead” on Netflix. It inspired me to try a juicing diet for a week. I went from eating more than 6,500 calories a day to eating around a thousand. To my surprise I soon realized that I was less hungry than I had ever felt before. After finishing the juicing diet, I reintroduced protein, but my insatiable appetite never quite returned. That’s when I realized it was carbs that were somehow triggering my appetite so I started following /r/keto.  Diet Style: Keto, a high fat, moderate protein, low carb way of eating. I try avoid most carbs. Most carbs I get are from green vegetables (broccoli, asparagus, spinach, avocado, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower). My macro goals are 60% fat, 30% protein, and 10% carbs. Calories: TDEE is around 2,300 calories a day. I eat a 500 daily calorie deficit to lose weight. On the days that I lift I usually eat about 300 calories above my TDEE in extra protein. Cardio: Minimum of 3 times a week. I do a mixture of indoor cycling, boxing, crossfit, stadium steps, kettle bells or running. Mixing it up mitigates the boredom and I think it’s more effective than doing the same workout daily.  I started very slowly, basically just walking, but added a little every time I worked out. I never pushed myself too hard. I made that mistake in the past and I think its counter-productive if you’re working out to the point that you don’t enjoy your exercise. Its amazing to me how fit I got over the long term by making very small increments in effort on a daily basis. On weekends I’m pretty active with paddle boarding, mountain biking, sky diving, or hiking. I personally feel like HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) in a fasted state is most effective for burning fat, but I’ve had a bunch of bros flaming me for saying this. Don’t really care. It worked very well for me. Weight lifting: After losing 80 pounds I hit a plateau that I couldn’t seem to break through. Also, I had some excess skin that I wanted to tighten up so I started lifting weights. Surprisingly (to me) this broke the stall I was in and I lost another 40 pounds. Its also helped tremendously with the loose skin. I lift 4 days a week for 60-75 minutes. I do a split routine hitting each muscle group twice a week. I don’t follow a specific program like starting strength or 5x5, but I vary my workout and lift as heavy as I can, using both free weights and machines. Although I vary my workout, I always try to include the basics, or slight variations of the basics (bench press, flys, dead lift, bent-over rows, push-ups, pull-ups, curls, preacher curls, squats, tricep pushdowns or extensions, close grip bench, leg press, leg extensions, dips). Again, I’ve been told how ineffective this is by some of the folks on here, but unfortunately I didn’t know that and I accidentally added a bunch of muscle anyway. Weight loss: Starting weight of 318 pounds at 49% body fat according to a bio-impedance scale. I now weight 195 pounds at 11% body fat measured by dexa. In total I lost approx. 123 pounds. Health: I no longer show signs of pre-diabetes, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver syndrome, my cholesterol has dropped over 80 points and I no longer take statins. I also have more energy than I ever remember having in my life. I truly believe the most important aspect of working out is just working out. A small, vocal group of bros attacked me this morning and told me how full of crap I am and how I’m spreading misinformation. Its funny to me. I have spent almost 5 years reading, learning, and trying a bunch of different stuff. The only thing I know for certain is that even the smartest people in the world, who study this stuff professionally, don’t quite understand the full picture yet. Maybe, just maybe, if I had the perfect routine and diet I would be a little leaner with a few pounds more muscle, but it doesn’t matter to me. I am extremely happy with the result I have achieved to date. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. Four and a half years may seem like a long time, but its not. It went by in a flash, just like it will if you do nothing to improve yourself, and every single day of this journey has had me feeling better and more confident about myself than the day before. There's an old saying that ""The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is right now."" So go ahead and plant right now. Reddit, you not only saved my life, you gave me a life worth living. I want to thank you, and I hope to give back by motivating and inspiring you. Good luck. ",Step 3: Have your heart broken...

4zyt4f,"First, Some background:  I had always been skinny growing up(too much video games), when I was 17 I got a gym membership that I only used when going with friends, I had no clue of what I was doing and so I made absolutely zero gains. Half a year later I gave the weights another try, this time without the friends involved. So it all started summer 2013, since i started out very skinny, I had a lot of time to be in a gaining phase before eventually having to diet. I weighed just below 110 lb at 5ft8 when I started out. I had no clue about calories when starting out, but i knew i had to eat way more then the last time around. That first summer of lifting, in an actual caloric surplus gained me 20 solid pounds. At this time I was following a typical 5 day split(All routines are below). As time passed I got more and more enthusiastic about making progress, so i started tracking calories, but still very loosely, just making sure that i was eating at a surplus. Having always been skinny I did not have a lot of appetite, therefor I had to force eat a lot(I pretty much ate anything and everything during this time). I eventually reached 190(my goal was actually 200), but I realised at this time that I had already over reached on this single bulk! I was straight up fat. So I started dieting at 190 and In my head i thought that i would be ripped at 170...oh how wrong i was. My diet lasted for just over 8 months, and i got A LOT better at dieting as time passed. As ripped as i thought I would be at 170, I was at 145.  > This is what a typical day of dieting at 2000 calories would look like:  >> Breakfast(Pre workout): Oats, banna, blueberries, and my secret to dieting: Peanut flour(this shit is golden) >> Lunch(Post workout): Cod with plain cooked potatoes and broccoli >> Dinner: Chicken/steak/beef and plain cooked potatoes >> Snack: Quark(cottage cheese) with cinnamon and blueberries As you can see I ate quite clean during my diet, that way I got the most satisfied! (plain cooked Potatoes where definetly the biggest source of carbs during my diet, they are as low as it gets in calories/100g) Everything I weighted on a scale and tracked with myfitnesspal. I always had a post workout shake after every workout, consisting of 10g creatine and 2 and a half scoops of whey. And for supplements while where at it, I only take whey protein, creatine and a pre-workout(very handy when dieting IMO) I was probably on 200mg+ caffeine every day.  Currently I am reverse dieting from my 8 month diet, so that i can begin a lean gaining phase as lean as possible.(I am adding 100 calories every 6th day, it should take me a month to get into a surplus)   Here is a short video of my journey: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9PzQW2FvpQ  Before lifting(fall 2013): http://imgur.com/a/8rmCo After the noobie gains phase, about 9 months into lifting: http://imgur.com/a/0P1UP As a skinny guy, i never thought i would end up like this: http://imgur.com/a/jAaCv After dieting for 8 months: http://imgur.com/a/wC6FZ http://imgur.com/a/nKWFm http://imgur.com/a/x5e53 My workout routines: > 1st year of lifting (5 day split): 1.Chest and tri 2.Back and bi 3.Legs 4.Shoulders and traps 5.Arms rest rest  > 2nd year - 4 day split 1.Chest and tri 2.Back and bi 3.Shoulder and traps 4.Legs rest  > 3rd year - 3day split(PPL) 1.Push 2.Legs 3.Pull  And this is the routine that I am now following, it is a modified PPL with a 4th day of push. I set this up myself, and I do not recommend you follow it, unless you want to focus on Chest, shoulders and tri's! * Push (chest focus) * Back * Rest * Push (shoulder focus) * Legs * Rest repeat  > **1.Push (chest)** Bench 5x5>2x8> dips 4x8> behind the neck ohp 4x10> 1triceps of choice 5x8>1side laterals of choice 5x10 (25sets total)  >> **2.Back + Abs** Pull ups 3x8(weighted)2x8(drop 10kg)>bb row 5x8> 1pulldown of choice 3x8s> 1back exercise of choice 3x8> 1curl of choice 4x8> 1hammercurl of choice 4x8> 1abs of choice 5x10 (29sets total)  **3.rest**  > **4.Push (shoulders)**  Ohp 5x5> narrow bench 5x8> incline db press 5x8> upright row 4x10> 1triceps of choice 4x8> facepull 4x10 (27sets total)  >> **5.Legs + calves** Squats/front squats 5x5> 1 compound of choice (i.e lunges) 4-5sets>1quad of choice 5x8> 1hamstring of choice 5x8> calves 5x6 standing and 5x12 seated (30 sets total)  **6.rest**  This routine is heavily focused on ""push"" and in my opinion it has a lot of rest. Its basically 2 days on and one off, and the volume is quite moderate. This is how it looks for now, when i stall, I will increase volume where I see fit.

51foii,"Hi Reddit! I'm posting to show my continued progress and provide information to allow others to do what I have done. Reading transformation posts on r/fitness is what got me started on my journey and I hope my own transformation post can inspire others to do the same. I owe a debt of gratitude to this community and would like to pay it back by helping others achieve what I have achieved. I will answer any question you may have. So ask!  --------------------- **Stats** --------------------- ---------------------  **Sex**: Male **Age**: 28 **Height**: 5’10” **Before** : **[240lb](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg)** (2011) **After**: **[173lb](http://i.imgur.com/pADfU13.jpg)**  (2016)  **[Face gains](http://i.imgur.com/0cXs0DZ.jpg)**  --------------------- **Recap** --------------------- ---------------------   * Back in 2011 I was diagnosed as prediabetic and **[clinically obese](http://i.imgur.com/WEZ1S8U.png)**. * I wanted to lose weight so I started lifting weights and tracking macros. * I lost 80lbs and was left with **[loose skin](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png)** and got it **[surgically removed](http://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg)**. * After the skin was gone, I decided I could finally get over my fear of taking my shirt off in public, so I entered a **[bodybuilding competition](http://i.imgur.com/5qPbxJR.jpg)**.  --------------------- **Update** --------------------- ---------------------  * **The bulk** - After the competition, I decided I wanted to add size and get stronger, so I started eating in a way that would increase my bodyweight and in turn also increase my strength and size. This is called **bulking**.  * **[The first bulk got out of hand](http://i.imgur.com/0I3iD1X.png)**. Although my strength had incresed a lot, when I cut down I realized that **[I hadn't gained much size](http://i.imgur.com/9qWVcCe.png)**.  * **Controlled surplus** - I learned that the amount of muscle I grew during a bulk was not necessarily proportionate to the amount of weight I was gaining. Our bodies can only create a small amount of muscle at a time, so there is no benefit to being in a large surplus of calories versus a smaller surplus of calories. The only difference is the amount of fat that is stored in addition to the muscle in a larger surplus. The important thing is to be in a surplus. This means taking in more calories than you expend in order to allow your body to adapt and get bigger and stronger. * **Current condition** - I have since been bulking and cutting for a couple years. I have found a groove where I relax my diet during the winter months and eat how I want while tracking my macros to make sure I am getting sufficient protein. As a naturally fat person, this results in weight gain. I then cut during the spring or summer months. Here is my most recent **[winter bulk (8 months) and summer cut (10 weeks)](http://i.imgur.com/c2Cf5tk.jpg)**   --------------------- **Diet** --------------------- ---------------------  * As a formerly obese person, I have tried or been prescribed just about every diet out there. What I have found to be most effective is the idea of energy balance. If your goal is to gain weight, you must eat more than your body requires. This is a caloric surplus. If you want to lose weight, you need to eat less than your body requires. This is a caloric deficit. If you want to maintain your bodyweight, you must eat around the amount your body expends in a day. This is called maintenance.  * **Maintenance** - In order to diet (gaining or losing) you must first find your maintenance calories. You can use a calorie calculator like **[this one](http://mytdee.com/)** to help estimate this number but this is only an estimate and you will need to use trial and error to find your own personal maintenance.   * **Tracking weight** - How I find my maintenance calorie intake is by weighing myself daily and taking my weekly averages. If my average weight from 2 consecutive weeks is around the same, I have found my maintenance calories. It is a moving target and will not be the same at the end of a cut as it was at the beginning of a cut.  * **Tracking calories** - Once I know my maintenance calories, I can gain weight by adding calories to that number or lose weight by subtracting. When I begin a gaining or losing phase, I always start with increments of 500 calories at a time added onto my daily calorie goals. If I was maintaining my weight on 2500 calories a day, I would begin my diet on 2,000. I subtract these calories from carbs and fats. The tricky part is tracking accurately. I use **[MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com)**.  * **Macros -** In a caloric surplus, as long as I am getting enough protein (0.8 to 1 gram per lb of bodyweight), it does not matter where the rest of the calories come from. In a deficit on the other hand, it can be important. If I am dieting, I always make sure to have at least 50 to 60 grams of fat. I have gone below 50 and I felt horrible. I keep my protein static year round and I eat as many carbs as my goals will allow. I like food.  * **[bulking macros](http://i.imgur.com/U7c5YXG.jpg)**: 450 carb/190 protein/75 fat * **[cutting macros](http://i.imgur.com/pADfU13.jpg)**: 250 carb/190 protein/60 fat * **Supplements:** creatine, fish oil, multivitamin, whey. I have never used steroids.  --------------------- **Training** --------------------- ---------------------  * **Strength training** To increase size and strength it is necessary to practice progressive overload. This is the idea of handling a higher workload overtime. The easiest way to do this is by focusing on strength. For this reason, I suggest starting out with a strength routine. I have done a couple strength routines in the past including **[5/3/1](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner)** and **[Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.com/get-started/programs)**. These are great routines.  * **Bodybuilding** - Over my lifting career, I have gravitated towards bodybuilder style lifting. I lift relatively heavy weights with an emphasis on stretching the muscle at one end of the rep and squeezing the muscle at the other end. I find that I feel good doing this and do not get injured. Most importantly, I enjoy it. By doing this day in and day out, I do gain strength (progressive overload) although not nearly as quickly as I would with a strength routine.   **Current maxes:** OHP: 185lb 1RM Squat: 365lb 3RM Bench: 275lb 3RM DL: 405lb (last tested over a year ago)  --------------------- **But how??** --------------------- ---------------------  * **""How do I motivate myself?""** This is the most frequent question I've received from my reddit posts and it’s difficult to answer. I don't know what motivates anyone else. For me, I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I read every transformation post on r/fitness over and over again until I had an idea of what to do and I finally took action. After that, I fell in love with this lifestyle. I no longer need to stay motivated because this is just what I like to do.  * **Make it routine** - When I was obese, I worked 40 hours a week and was very tired when I got home. The last thing I wanted to do was drive another 20 minutes to the gym. What I did instead was brought my gym clothes with me to work. I changed in the bathroom at work and stopped at the gym on my way home. This way it wasn't a choice. I did not need strong willpower every day. It was just part of my routine. The hardest part is often just getting to the gym.  --------------------- **Lessons learned** --------------------- ---------------------  * **Cardio is not necessary for weightloss** - In the begining of my journey, **[I ran on an elliptical every day and I hated it](http://i.imgur.com/NJWhPjM.jpg)**. What I didn't know at the time was the idea of energy balance. Cardio worked because it increased my daily energy expenditure and forced me into a deficit. What I wish I had known was that those 300 calories I was burning every day on the elliptical could have just as easily come out of my diet. One less pop tart would have had the exact same affect on my physique.   * **Tracking accurately** - Diet is the most important aspect of fitness. The way we look, feel and perform comes down to diet above all else. In order to control this aspect, it is important to be able to track it accurately. For me, this took a lot of practice. A behavior of mine that contributed to my obesity and still hinders my diet sometimes is unconscious eating. I stand in front of the fridge or a cupboard and shovel food into my mouth without even recognizing it. By tracking everything that enters my mouth I am able to recognize unconscious eating and stop myself before I start. Tracking my diet, body weight, pictures and the weights I lift also gives me the ability to view progress and analyze variables. Being able to manipulate these variables is essential to achieving my goals. -----------  If you are thinking about getting started on your own fitness journey, do yourself a favor and begin today.

54fphc,"[In this follow-along video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGEpQ1BRx-4) I share with you the intricacies that turn the lunge into a **very effective** stretch for your hip flexors which are the muscles at the front of the thigh/hips. The muscles such as the [rectus femoris](https://i.imgur.com/BwwQ7Qb.jpg) and the [iliopsoas complex.](https://i.imgur.com/h3jMuSd.jpg)) ##**Benefits:**  * For people who sit a lot and don't stretch the hip flexors, they have often lost all hip extension and need to restore it. Stretching the hip flexors will help your hips **have more hip extension** (read: the ability to bring your thighs behind you without arching the lower back to compensate).  * Lunges are a commonly prescribed basic stretch if someone is having lower back pain, because the iliopsoas complex (deep hip flexor) connects the thighs to the lower back, and if they're tight they pull on the lower back. Doing it in a low lunge is a very good start toward stretching them. * The cues in the video (squaring, tucking, etc) are applicable to **ALL** hip flexor stretches, including high/standing lunges or the couch/wall quad stretch and so forth. ###Here is the [Link to the YouTube Video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGEpQ1BRx-4) Let me know how you like it or have any questions! ###Edit: If you had trouble listening to the video cause the background music was too loud, [here's the version without background music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NITPD0beV74) **tl;dw:** I teach you how to square the hips (remember, it's always back-hip forward, front-hip backward), then my favorite way of getting people to tuck the hips (posteriorly tilt the hips using your hands) and small but important details like making sure the back foot is in line with the mat/carpet and the front foot is ahead of the knee and so on. ----------- **Edit: The support has been overwhelming...ly awesome!

Started working out around 7th grade so about 12 or 13? I was a very shy awkward Chinese kid in a predominantly  white american school. I also had the mushroom haircut to top it off LoL. I was never bullied and i had the normal amount of friends. My main problem was the females. For the life of me i could just never talk to women. I knew i wasn't good looking and my skinny and soft bod didn't help my confidence. From there i bought my first Muscle & Fitness and my life changed. I always looked up to Bruce Lee so that was the physique that was ingrained in my head. The Abercrombie & Fitch look was very popular at this time. Also Brad Pitt in ""Fight Club"" came out around this time (damn I'm old lmao) and every girl and their grandma was talking about that fight club body. (Shout out to Brad & Angelina LoL) This inspired me to have that type of physique. Abs quickly became my main focus and by far my favorite muscle to train. So it took me about 4-5 years to attain a decent physique. Around junior to senior high school i finally had decent arms and a little 4 pack. http://imgur.com/ON43ytK My nutrition at the time was very simple. Probably the average high school kid diet with more of an emphasis on protein. Honey bunches of oats cereal, trail mix, Met-rx protein bars, turkey sandwhiches, chicken patties from school, 711 hot dogs, Wendy's, McChickens, 20 piece McNuggets, rotisserie chicken, gallons of Gatorade. All i tracked was the protein. Cals were prob around 2500-3000 over 3-4 meals a day.

I say nutrition instead of ""diet"" because I want people to make it a lifestyle. Any muscle you gained, gain it permanently. Any fat you lose, lose it permanently. Currently hovering around 145-150 lbs. Im very active everyday so it allows me to eat more. I literally never have an ""Off"" day where i do absolutely nothing. If I decide to skip gym and dance, I will usually just stretch at home. My stretch sessions can take up to an hour. Typical meal is white basmati rice with a protein...chicken thighs, beef / steak, shirmp, sausage. Goal is to get 150g of protein per day. Then fill the rest of the calories with carbs and fat. Cheat day is every Sunday. What i do is wake up and go dance or do abs at the gym on an empty stomach. Then I'll go for all you can eat sushi or Pho (noodles) somewhere. I don't track protein on Sunday. I also will have chips like Ruffles cheddar sour cream & a whole can of Blue Diamond wasabi almonds while watching football. Also other foods that i normally don't have during the week. Cals are prob the same, It's just that the foods are ""dirty"". It feels great not to track anything. Typical Day of 3000-3500 cals (5am) Pre-Breakfast: Black coffee or *sugar free Rockstar, Red Bull, Monster, Redline energy drink (10-20c) (6am) Breakfast: Whole eggs in coconut oil, peanut butter, 1 cup dry quick oats. Blueberries, Raisins (800c) (7am) Work: Shipping & Receiving / Loading trucks (constantly moving, good cardio LoL) (11:30am) Lunch: Chipotle steak bowl with guac (obviously) or footlong from SubWay or **(same as pwo) (800c) (3pm) Leave Work / Pre Workout: Dunkin Donuts black ice coffee or *(same as pre-breakfast, some sort of caffiene) (4pm-6pm) Workout / Train (7pm) Post Workout: **Half cup measured dry basmati rice, 10-12 oz some sort of protein in coconut oil (800c) (10pm) Dinner: **(same as post workout) (800c) Snacks: 1 serving almonds = 28 almonds, Muscle Milk shake RTD from gym, Ramen, Cereal (these vary day to day) Supplements: Absoutely drug free 100% natty.

My advice is once you hit your goal weight...just start a maintenance phase and make slow gains for the rest of your life. Enjoy your new body forever.... not just for the next month then back to fatness. None of this dirty bulking crap. I cringe every time people lose a lot of weight then are like ok im done! Time to eat! Just try to add maybe 100 to 200 cals over maintenance and you will improve. I think the most I've ever weighed was prob around the 160 range. You will get stronger on a very small surplus. Just be patient. I was very impatient in the beginning. I wanted abs by next week! Never mind 4 years. Just because you don't have something now... doesn't mean you won't ever have it. The only thing separating you from abs is a couple hundred ab workouts and a deficit of a couple hundred thousand calories. The only thing separating you from being a doctor is 8-10 years of Med school. Save up 100 grand 10 times and you will be a millionaire. Once you lay it out like this your vision becomes more clear. Anything is possible. This is the logic i came up with. I used to tell myself i don't have abs ""yet"". I don't have a driver license ""yet"". I don't have a girlfriend ""yet"". As long as i knew i would be there one day that's all that mattered. There's always a future version of yourself that is depending on your actions right now. In 2 years i will be 30. That scares the shit out of me LoL. My 30 year old self is depending on the actions i make today. Procrastination is a dream killer guys. Never put things off. DO IT NOW and you'll love yourself for it. ALL THIS WILL PAY OFF ONE DAY. If you're just starting out just remember to love the process. Focus on what you're working for while enjoying working for it. There's a quote... success is just a bunch of small victories. Increasing your PR on bench by 10 lbs. It's not that much. But knowing you have never done that much in your entire life...that's a special feeling that's hard to describe. Whatever your goal is just remember that YOU WILL get there. Probably not by tomorrow. Unlikely by next week. Maybe by next month? Who knows. Who cares. All that matters is you got 1 day closer. Closer then you were 24 hrs ago. It's inevitable as long as you keep progressing pound by pound, day by day. That moment you finally take action is a win. Progress is victory. Achievement is success! You will be there one day I promise! Edit 1:  What's up fam! Wow you guys are amazing. I'm currently at work right now about to grab the Chipotle lunch meal. I sit on this thread everyday soaking up info from you guys, and to see my journey help you in any way....means the world...extremely humbling. I'm going to edit in time stamps to the typical day to make it more clear after a brief skim through comments. Also i want to add my freshmen year high school pic. I gained a lot of fat from all the extra protein calories i was consuming. I never i mentioned i had a very low self esteem. Borderline depression through my early years.

55vvkj,"I've never done this before but i just wanted to give some feedback about my weight loss / gym training which i have done for about a year now (started end of September 2015). So - i just finished looking through my pictures from last year until now and i realized how much weight i have lost. Up until now it's about 35kg (77 pounds). I still haven't reached my goal yet but i'm feeling it getting warmer every week and every month. I have done nothing out of the ordinary than just getting my lazy ass to the gym 3-5 times a week (in the beginning 5 times, now about 3 times) and just sweating the shit off of me. Primarily i've done more cardio in the beginning and kept lifting to a minimum - but some months ago i realized that it's kind of fun, too. So now i have a good mix of lifting and cardio and i really enjoy it. I didn't just go to the gym regularly though - i have changed my eating habits completely. No shitty food, every day cooking with healthy, at first weird looking green stuff (a good mix of vegetables, meat and carbs - no Keto diet or something else). But hey - i like it now (except the time consuming cooking, geez). So yeah - at the end some pics because without pics it didn't happen, right? http://imgur.com/a/GdkKM  I hope someone who reads this and is in the state i was a year ago can find some motivation out of it. Just go and keep on it. You are helping yourself so much. I really can't describe how i am feeling now compared to my old self one year ago. It's just plain awesome.  Oh yeah, almost forgot the important stuff: 26 years old, 1,79m (5,10 feet) and currently 102kg (224 pounds). My next goal is 90kg (198 pounds) - after that i will see where it gets me :-)  Edit: Sorry, i forgot the really important stuff to not be a bragger (i really didn't want that). Also i don't know if i got the translation of the excercises correct since i'm not a native english speaker.  All excercises are 4 sets with 10 repetitions.  I started with ""beginner"" excercises, like: * leg press, started with 60kg up to 155kg * leg extension, started with 35kg up to 50kg * leg curl, started with 54kg up to 70kg * chest presses, started with 33kg up to 50kg * butterfly, started with 33kg up to 50kg * neck shoulder press (?), started with 15kg up to 30kg * lat pulldown, started with 47kg up to 65kg * seated machine rows (?), started with 35kg up to 50kg  After that, took me about 3-4 months, i switched the excercises: * smith machine - hack squat, started with 10kg up to 25kg * lunges, started with own weight and up to 25kg * incline barbell bench press, started with 10kg up to 25kg * lat pulldown (tight grip?), started with 50kg up to 60kg * back extensions (only because i had some trouble with cycling), started with 40kg up to 55kg  For cardio i mostly cycled for about 1 hour after the lifting. I also mixed it up with a cross-trainer and cycling (30 minutes each). Quite recently i've stepped it up with a machine where i can walk stairs - don't know how it's called though (Edit: [StairMaster!](http://fitnessequipmentprofessionals.com/images/stories/virtuemart/category/stairmaster_sm5_d164.jpg) - this guy is a total bitch, holy shit). During the summer i also drove with the bike to my work place (40km in total).  Edit: formatting, added pounds",Great job man. It's post like this that keep us all going.,546
56ex2y,"**Some backstory:** A little over a year ago my wife and I split up. As so eloquently written by [this guy](http://aaronbleyaert.tumblr.com/post/109959086957), heartbreak really can be an important step towards self improvement - but I don't want to dwell too much on that. After a couple of months of feeling bad for myself I joined a local gym chain and started working out.  Before I get too deep into the details, [Here's](http://imgur.com/8vyn7bt) a progress pic. Unfortunately I didn't take many pics before I started training. Starting weight was 165-170lbs.  **The Routine:** For the first ~9 months of lifting, I ran a bro-split program (chest/tris, back/bis, shoulders, legs) 3-5 times a week, repeating days as necessary. I enjoyed doing this and saw some progress, but suffered from fuckarounditis - even though I was tracking all of my workouts using the iOS app Strong, I wasn't working towards any specific goals, hadn't put much thought into creating a balanced program, and frequently neglected leg day and working to make progress on my compound lifts. By the time I was done with this routine, I could bench more than I could squat or deadlift... On July 24th I started running [metallicadpa's PPL routine] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/), 6 days a week, with some modifications. I've been through the full routine roughly 9-10 times (some days skipped due to injury) and have been really happy with my progress on my compound lifts and appearance.  Here's my specific routine as I run it right now: **Pull Day** (Twice a week with slight variation) *EITHER* Deadlifts 3x5 @ 235lbs *OR* Bent Over Barbell Rows 5x5 @ 170lbs    Weighted Pull-ups 5x5 @ BW+60lbs, with BW only warmup and back off sets Lat Pulldown 3x12 @ 125 Seated Cable Row 3x12 @ 150 Face Pull 5x15 @ 30lbs Incline Curls 4x12 @ 30lbs/side Barbell Curls 4x12 @ 60lbs  Preacher Curl 4x12 @ 65 lbs I'll also throw in some supersets of bodyweight neutral grip pull-ups and hanging leg raises at the end, if I have time/energy. **Push Day** (Twice a week with slight variation) *EITHER* Bench Press 5x5 @ 185lbs *OR* Overhead Press 5x5 @ 105lbs *EITHER* Overhead Press 3x12 @ 75lbs *OR* Bench Press 3x12 @ 135lbs (whichever wasn't done 5x5 first that day) Incline Bench Press 3x12 @ 100lbs Weighted Dips 5x12 @ 60lbs, with BW only warmup and back off sets Skull Crushers 3x12 @ 60lbs Cable Tricep Pushdown 3x12 @50lbs Lateral Raise 5x12 @ 15lbs/side **Leg Day** (Twice a week, same both times) Squats 3x5 @ 215lbs Romanian Deadlift 3x12 @ 190lbs Leg Press 3x12 @ 423lbs Leg Curl 3x12 @ 115lbs Calf Raise (Machine) 5x12 @ 150lbs Since starting this routine (7/24-10/7), my big three lifts have progressed as follows (5 rep maxes): Bench Press 155lbs -> 185lbs Deadlift 145lbs -> 235lbs Squat 145lbs -> 215lbs Early on I also completed C25k and came close to finishing C10K, but stopped due to knee and back pain. I haven't really gotten back into running or cardio of any sort, but would like to in the future. **Diet:** Breakfast: Whey in water and a banana, or full fat Greek yogurt with whey and a banana mixed in Lunch: Grilled chicken, hard-boiled eggs, spinach, avocados Dinner: Salad with tomatoes, peppers, onions, cucumbers, cheese, sometimes grilled chicken or hard-boiled eggs, and oil & vinegar Snacks: Almonds, apples, whey in water Drinks: Coffee, water, all the alcohol (seriously this is my biggest downfall) Of course there's a ton of variation but the above is a decent look at what I eat most days. I used MFP for about a month to hammer out the macros I wanted. I still weigh my food and follow a similar profile to the one I did when I was doing MFP. I try to eat at maintenance, roughly 2200-2300 calories/day broken down as 144g protein, 77g fat, 260g carbs.  **Supplements:** Daily: Multivitamin, 2g Fish Oil, 5000 IUs Vitamin D, 5g Creatine  Occasionally: C4 or Amino Energy pre workout, ZMA, Melatonin **Lessons Learned:** * Don't be so obsessed with progress at all costs - early on, and to some extent to this day, I allowed myself to become addicted to progress and not skipping days. As a result, I hurt my knees by running too much too soon, hurt my back pushing my deadlifting weight up without giving enough care to form, and hurt my shoulders benching. I wish I could tell my former self that working through these injuries would just lead to more setbacks than just taking time off in the first place. * Find a good program and stick to it - I wish I found and started using the PPL program I'm on now way earlier. I enjoy it way more than I enjoyed my original splits routine, and I've made much better progress since starting it. * Just start - for years I would obsess over finding the perfect workout routine and the right gym to do it in, rather than just going to the gym and doing something. I wish I had started years earlier, even if it was with a fuckarounditis routine (sort of contradicts my previous point I suppose).  * Discipline over motivation - my divorce was initially a great source of motivation for me to get to the gym, but over time that faded and discipline took over. Over the past several months I've managed to impress myself by getting to the gym regardless of social plans, travel, or hangovers sent by the devil himself.   **Next Steps** Right now I'm chasing a 2 plate bench and 3 plate squat and deadlift. Hoping to make serious progress towards those goals by the end of the year. Also considering doing a clean bulk at some point this winter, but scared of getting fat (jk, kind of).  Couldn't have done it without /r/fitness. This subreddit has proved to be a great resource and source of motivation for me. I read the majority of the posts and try to absorb as much information as I can. [Some more pics](http://imgur.com/a/p5Rju) Happy to answer any questions!","Looking really good, man.

573zub,"I'll preface this by saying I'm part of a gym that I'm really thankful to be a part of - The trainers encourage you to grow stronger physically and mentally. The owners of the gym have managed to hire on some great people that embody their core values.  The trainers are always there to encourage and challenge you.  When I first signed up I got some flak from my girlfriend because it is more expensive than most people would consider reasonable for a gym - $150 a month. This was actually a blessing in disguise because when you're spending that much money you're going to show up as much as you can. I started showing up 3x a week and it became a habit.  Up until this year the best I had done was stick with P90x for about 3 months at a time and then drop off. This was hard to stick to because I was alone in my living room with no one to push me or help me correct my form. Also I was doing the same 3 workouts 3x a week and never really advancing.  One of the first things the coach said to me is that weightlifting is very 'humbling', I don't think I really knew what he meant until recently. When I started, I was a pretty average build with a beer belly and some love handles. Unfortunately I still have a belly and love handles but I have seen more definition in my arms, shoulders and chest than I ever have before. I have realized that even though I've been busting my ass for 6 months and not reached where I expected to be, this isn't some sort of fad diet, it's the beginning of a new lifestyle change for me.  This is where I realized that even though I'm not where I thought I would be after 6 months of training, I'm now 100% fine with knowing that **I'm in the process of getting better**.  The mindset shift from ""I'm not where I want to be"" to ""I'm in the process of getting to where I want to be"" has affected all aspects of my life. By making a habit out of weight lifting, I am always feeling like I'm making progress in at least one area of my life. Before I would often compare myself to other people that I would perceive as doing better than me. I recently realized that I no longer compare myself, I've accepted that I'm striving to improve and that's all that I can do.  This has in effect 'humbled' me and allowed me to accept that I need to stay consistent in any area of my life to get to where I want to be. I think many of us are guilty of wanting something that we don't yet deserve. Our culture is hooked on instant gratification but it's really the people who put in work that get the real gratification.  Now that I'm more at ease about my life, it's easier for me to be grateful for what I have going for me rather than comparing myself to others and noticing what I lack. This training of my body has indirectly been training for my mental health.  I've become a little more confident however I have always been a bit over weight and have never been confident taking my shirt off in public. I've never been more certain in my life that I will get there. I have never felt what it's like to be 100% confident with my body but I can imagine that it will have even more positive impacts on my mental health. I'm 27 years old and I live in Florida.... What a waste it would be if I didn't take advantage of this time in my life to become the best version of myself. Atleast I know that in a year from today I will be closer to that goal than I ever have been.","In the last year and a half that I have been lifting, the one girl I thought I'd marry left me for a friend, our friend group cut me out, and my mom passed away. The single constant in my life I feel like I can count on is lifting/exercise. When I feel like everything else is falling apart or regressing, there's been one single thing that I can count on that has positive results. Whereas with relationships I can put in 100% and have 0% return, I know my efforts in this one area will always have a real, tangible result. I am so fucking thankful that I started seriously focusing on my diet and exercise at 27. I wish I had started sooner, because my mentality towards so much else has changed. Whereas before I thought I either could or couldn't, my mindset now is I can; it just takes time and effort.",340
58dps9,"I recently competed in a powerlifting competition which took place in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where I benched 556 lbs, which is now the current American bench record for my age (all weight classes). I have been competing for 5 years and got into powerlifting as an outlet to deal with adversities in life. My goal is to be the youngest person to bench press 600 lbs in competition. I hope to accomplish this goal within the next 6 to 8 months.  Here's the video of the 556 bench: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfk-Qqm4WRk  My current training protocol is an 8 week bench program that requires two bench days a week (one heavy and one light). The regimen can be compared to a linear progression, where you add 5-10 lbs every week to the heavy day. This program has increased my bench 76 lbs in 9 months, from 480 lbs to 556 lbs. I plan to continue using this program in order to bench press 600 lbs.  A quick summary of the program would be the following:  * The first week of training starts starts with a heavy day (this day is considered to be a day where the weight being used is more taxing on the body than a typical training day) at 75% of your current 1 rep max (the most weight you can lift for one repetition) for 3 sets of 5 repetitions.  * The first light day (this day is a day where the weight being used is not very taxing on the body and allows you to focus more on the technique of the lift) also starts at 75% of your current 1 rep max for 5 sets of 5 repetitions. As you see, the first week of the program requires both days to use the same weight, but this changes week by week because each week the weight increases (only on the heavy day) by 5-10 lbs (depending on how easy the previous week was).  * Continue this training for 8 weeks. After the 8th week, decrease the weight to 50% of current 1 rep max. The subsquent week, try maxing out.  My diet:  * my diet is not the healthiest diet, but i make sure to consume at least 120 grams of protein a day by way of protein powder and high protein foods (steak, chicken, fish). sometimes i will allow myself a really big meal such as twelve tacos or a huge plate of cajun french fries.  * the way my school schedule is and training schedule, I am only able to eat twice a day (once after school and once after training) but I make these meals count by eating a sufficient amount of calories to sustain high energy levels. For example, a typical meal before the gym for me would be two grilled chicken sandwiches with a bottle of gatorade or fruit punch.  Benching 556 lbs. was a huge PR for me. But I see it as a milestone. And now a 600 lbs. is the next goal for me to achieve. Currently, the youngest person to bench 600 lbs. in competition is Josh Bryant, the creator of Jailhouse strong. He was 22 years old and 9 months weighing at 306. I have until December, 2017, to beat his record, and I plan on weighing no more than 275 pounds.  Thanks for watching my video and reading my post. Please ask me any questions if you have them and Ill be glad to answer.","This is a Public Service Announcement. Form police and form trolls are not welcome here.

I was astonished to note that it read 250lbs. Having spent most of my youth as a twigling and most of my early adult years at around 215lbs, it was now apparent that something had to be done about the human milk bag that I had become. With my new found self-loathing I was ready to begin my journey into the strange new world of healthy eating.  **Changing Habits** I, like many desperate folks at the end of December decided to cast my lot into the cliche and often ill advised *New Years Resolution*. I downloaded My Fitness Pal to begin tracking my calories and to figure out my TDEE after consulting a friend who had had great success doing the same. I set the parameters to 2lbs a week at ‘lightly active’ Now it was simply a matter of willpower to remain focused and eat at a caloric deficit day in and out. My typical day for the first several months would look something like this and consist of between 1800 and 2300 cals: Breakfast: 2 eggs 1 slice of rye bread Tea with milk Lunch: 150g of chicken with hot sauce 85g carrots Dinner: 150g Chicken Mass of veggies Night Snack: Celery Cheese whiz, cottage cheese, greek yoghurt  **Mistakes Were Made** Do I have any regrets? Yes a few. There were days when I was not eating nearly enough (1500-1700cals) and trying to train. These days felt wasted a lot of the time and I spent many a gym trip fatigued. In the beginning I was pumped so full of motivation that it didn’t bother me for the first few months but in mid April I encountered some heavy stress from external events in my life and relapsed for a few weeks, gaining several pounds. This may have been avoidable if I had been on a more tolerable caloric deficit. **Mantra** What I have come to believe is basically the same mumbo jumbo that is constantly spouted on this subreddit all of the time. Motivation is for suckers and when it runs out you better have established habits, ritual even, that you are going to be willing to stick to when things get tough. Thus discipline>motivation. Next I firmly believe consistency will always out achieve intensity.. Finally I believe that in the grand scheme of things that your diet is at least as important as what you do in the gym.  **Regimen** *PHUL* My workouts are pretty basic. I squat, deadlift, OHP, bench and have now tried to focus on some arm work because I neglected the poor Dostovei’s for too long. Leg day example: Squat: 135x12 185x12 225x6 275x2x4 245x5 Deadlift: 135x12 225x12 315x6 365x3x2 315x10 Leg extensions: 4x12 Leg Curl: 4x12  Upper Body day: Superset Bench: 135x12 185x10 225x5 245x3x3 225x3 Superset Pullup: 10x5 SS Sitting military press: 60’sx8x5 SS Bent over row: 135x12 185x5 205x3 225x2 185x5 Curls and tri extensions until the cows come home  **Photographic Evidence** [Before and After](https://imgur.com/gallery/z8eGV) **Where to Next** As of this week I have begun eating at maintenance and am trying to figure out what my calorie surplus is going to look like for a bulking phase. I hope to add some mass and look forward to some strength gains. If anyone has some physique critiques, advice on a good program or any other words of encouragement I would love to hear them!  **Special Thanks** I would just like to thank /r/fitness because honestly my biggest motivation for getting fit again was just simply wanting to make a transformation post that would hopefully motivate somebody else to make a change in their life. I have always loved looking at these posts and they have really inspired me to strive to be a stronger and healthier human being. Cheers Fitit.  **Edit:** I've been asked a lot of the same questions so I will try to answer some of them here. How many days did I go to the gym a week? Typically I went 4 times a week. Some weeks I went 2 or 3, or 0. Some I went 5.   What was I eating? I tried to do 2 things. I eliminated all of the processed food out of my diet and have now become and excellent cook because of it. I stopped drinking pop/soda/cola completely. I did not want to restrict myself any further than that and fortunately did not have to. I ate the same thing for breakfast (eggs, toast, tea) and lunch (chicken or  tuna, carrots or celery) every single day for those 10 months. For dinner I ate fajitas, homemade pizza, stir fry, hamburgers, and pasta. I didn't do anything differently but I just ate much, much less. Instead of eating 3 hamburgers I ate 1. Instead of eating a small families worth of lasagna, I ate a small slice.  Did I have cravings? No I did not. I was not really intermittently fasting but I much prefer to save my calories until the end of the day when I had more willpower and after I had gone to the gym. If I eat a lot of food in the morning I find I am hungrier throughout the day. You need to find out what works for you.  What was the hardest part of the journey? My dad got really sick at one point and I stopped going to the gym for about 2 weeks so I could go down to the hospital to visit him. During this period I was stress eating as well. Fortunately some very talented surgeons saved his life and he has made a full recovery. I almost completely fell off the wagon at this time and it really stymied my progress.  What do my typical workouts look like? I have a posted section about my workouts in my original write up. Generally I sweat but I don't kill myself. I take 3-5 min breaks between my primary lifts and a min to 90 seconds between my accessories. I also super set everything I do with the exception of squats and deadlifts.  When did I focus on dieting? This past January.  Tips for other people in my situation?  Make small changes so that you can make a lifestyle change. Download My Fitness Pal, it is in my opinion the single most important fitness tool that exists and it is free. You are insane not to take advantage of it.  Did I do cardio: No. Zero treadmill, elliptical, stair climber, erg, or anything else. I played some tennis over the summer but that's it. In the past I had tried to lose weight using cardio but I had been *very* unsuccessful. It is much easier to eat a smaller portion then to sweat on the stationary bike for an hour.  Do I track macros? Not really. I try to get at least 140g of protein a day but beyond that I don't really care as  long as I am not hungry. I have fallen into a groove where I am comfortable with what I eat.     ",Holy shit you went from average flabby guy to Captain America in one picture. The change in your face is amazing. ,513

59dwfb,"Hi Reddit! I cross posted this to /r/crossfit. If this isn't allowed, mods, feel free to delete.  I had previously shared my weight loss story a few months back but only shared the basics with just face photos. I wanted to share how I lost my weight and became a Crossfit athlete along with full body photos. **The background story:** Ever since I can recall (probably around the age of 12), I have been overweight/obese. By the age of 19, I was at my heaviest when I hit 285 pounds. I decided I wanted to lose weight and started running with some gym work. I was able to shed about 40 pounds, although my diet was still sloppy. I fluctuated around this weight and around the age of 24, I decided to check out the local Crossfit gym. With the support of the local gym, I learned the Paleo lifestyle but for some reason, I wouldn't stick to it. I would eat great 2-3 days a week, workout 1-2 times per week and then go back to my old, unhealthy lifestyle. I would lose a pound or two one week and gain 3-4 the next. It was a large struggle.  I later moved to a different region and joined the local crossfit in this city. I decided I wanted to take the gym a bit more serious and this is where the transformation happened: **The crossfit/exercise :** What called me to this specific gym was the fact the box owner was in the Regionals that year and the box frequently had top athletes in local competitions. I figured if I could do half of what they do, I should at least look somewhat better than the fat dude I once was. I began their programming at the age of 27 (about 2.5 years ago). My goal was somehow, someway, to turn back over 15 years of damage the best way I can, and this was exercising every day with a great diet. I started doing their WOD every single day, 5-6 days per week. I would rarely miss more than twice per week. I would scale accordingly and in the beginning, I couldn't finish a single workout in the time provided. The days I wasn't feeling in the mood to crossfit, I would push myself to run at least a 5k. The 5k was difficult to achieve in the earlier days so I would run half a mile, walk half, etc. Now, it's much easier, I could run an entire 5K unbroken, albeit, my times are not excellent, running below 9 minutes is satisfactory for me.  **The Diet:** Modified Paleo. I would try Paleo the best I can but I wouldn't solely stick to it. If it wasn't available or I wasn't in the mood, I would just try to eat as healthy as I possibly could and portion-control took a huge part. **Current Status:** I've since become a fitness-fan. I don't just love Crossfit, I love fitness. I enjoy running. I now get an exciting feeling when my hands grip a barbell. I enjoy speaking about fitness and love when I hear people share their stories. I enjoy the healthy lifestyle that I always thought I would never be a part of. I used to give myself excuses - from ""My genes aren't made to be fit"" to ""I must have something wrong with me, I just can't lose weight"".  This past weekend, this former 285lb fat boy competed in his first local competition. I didn't place top 3, I did compete scaled and not RX, I placed decent, I completed every single workout on time and even placed 1st in my division on one of the 7 workouts. I'm not a Games' Athlete but I am proud of how far I've gotten. **Current Shape:** You will notice on the photos, while I look significantly different from my original self a few years back, I have scars to remind me of my lack of fitness years ago. The stretch marks are there and the excess/loose skin, while not a whole lot, is very visible. At the moment, I don't plan on surgery. This is me, this is what I look like and I don't know what I may consider tomorrow, but at the time being, they're a reminder of the bad choices I've made in years past which I hope to never put myself through again. **PHOTOS:** It was really hard to find a before pic without a shirt since I was ashamed of how my body looked. Here's a few old shots I was able to find.

5bpywx,"[Before and After](https://imgur.com/gallery/v34QG) Hey /r/fitness I wanted to share the first step of my journey with you!  So much of what I have learned came from this sub Reddit, like eating habits, diets,  exercises and so much more.  For anyone out there who is doubting themselves or struggling to find that motivation, I know how hard it can be. How slow the results seem to come. You can do it, its all about seeing what you CAN be, instead of seeing what you are.  If you guys are interested Ill post what exercises I used, just let me know! Thanks in advance for everything you guys.   EDIT: So this got a lot more attention than I expected with people asking for Workout routines and diet plans so here we go. If you see any glaring errors in the workouts or diet below feel free to let me know! Always looking to improve.  EDIT: Okay people really? Stop reporting the post and get over yourselves I fixed it. Really going to be that anal about it?  My workout routine is six days a week, with one rest day in the middle. I also train abs every day at the end of each workout, Ill post the Ab workout towards the end.  Day 1: Chest/Biceps/Abs Incline dumbbell press, 4x12 Bench press, 4x10 Cable Fly, 4x12 Chest Press Machine, 4x12 Dumbbell fly, 4x12 Preacher EZ bar Curls, 4x12 Dumbbell curls, 3x10 Chin ups, 3x10 *Ab Workout at the end* Day 2: Back/Triceps/Abs Lat-Pulldowns, 4x10 Cable Rows, 4x12 Dumbbell Side Bend, 4x12 Overhead Tricep Extensions, 4x12 Pull ups, 3x10 Dumbbell Rows, 4x12 *Ab Workouts at the end* Day 3: Legs/Abs I use a variety of machines for leg day, pretty much ever machine my gym here has to offer. To be honest I don't know the names of all of them, so I will do the best I can.  Squats Rack . I start on the squat rack first. Here I place my starting weight, about 120lbs and do two sets of ten. I then add another 25 lbs to each side, and do 1 set of 8 reps. Then add more weight and do 1 set of 6 reps. Going down in variables of two and adding more weight each time. This was shown to me by a classmate and I've been sticking with it, so far it works wonders.  Lunges. 20lbs in each hand (whatever weight works for you is fine. If you are just starting I recommend doing the first couple with little to no weight. The burn is more intense than you realize, especially when you just start.  4 sets of 10. At this point my legs start to feel numb and shaky, and the most brutal part of the workout is over.  Leg Press (horizontal) 4x10 Leg Press (Elevated) 4x10 Leg Extension machine, 4x12 *End with abs* Day 4: Rest Day. God I can't get over how important rest day is to the workout. My muscles are always in shock after the first three days, and its important to just give them time to rebuild. On rest days however don't turn into a massive couch potato. Try to be active somewhat. Go for a light jog, move around. Keep your blood flowing. Also if you are trying to gain weight like me, this is the best day to eat a lot! Day 5: Shoulder day Seated shoulder dumbbell press(90 degrees), 4x12 Seated shoulder dumbbell press(45 degrees), 4x12 EZ bar standing shoulder press, 5x12 (this one feels the best burn IMO) Lateral raises, (90, 45, 0), 3x10 each One arm Cable Raises, 4x120 *Finish with abs* Day 6: Arm Day (every Teenage boy's favorite right?) Overhead Tricep Extensions, 5x20 EZ bar curl 5x20 Hammer curl, 5x20 One Armed Cable Curl 5x20 Bench Dips, 5x20 DB Preacher Curl, 5x20 Tricep Rope Pulldowns, 5x20 2 Arm bar cable curl, 5x20 Wrist Curls, 5x20 Reverse Wrist Curls, 5x20 This workout is probably the most brutal, and I have only started doing it for the last two months. Go slow here, if you rush it you will wear out your arms and not be able to finish the whole workout. I learned that the hard way Day 6: Leg day #2.  (See leg day above) Ab workout: The way I workout my abs is a bunch of exercises in a row, followed by a rest of about a minute and a half. Then I repeat 2 more times. So the following workouts are done 3 times with a rest period between each set.  Standard planks, 1 minute Side planks (both sides) 1 minute each Leg kickers (I think this is the right name for them) x20 Crunches x20 Leg rotators? I don't know the name for this one. But you lie on your back and place your hands under your butt. Then rotate the legs in a small circle counterclockwise, then clockwise the other way back. One rotation both ways is 1 full rep. Do this 10 times After every workout, I'm sure you have heart it many times here before, but you NEED protein within half an hour of each workout. I make my own ""Calorie shakes"", as I call them. They get me the protein I need after a workout as well as increase my calorie intake for the day drastically.  3 ounces of whole milk, 5 scoops of ice cream. 2 bananas and two scoops of chocolate whey protein powder.  The entire thing comes out to about 1100 calories (Ballpark).  DIET Diet is huge. Diet is so much huger than I realized when starting. My diet is pretty standard every day, and has massively helped me put on the weight I wanted. Also the majority of this diet comes from information I found here on /r/fitness! So thank you guys! Breakfast: 4 eggs, scrambled. Two packets of oatmeal, two scoops of peanut butter, mixed with a handful of raspberries. It makes it taste like a warm PB&J. I absolutely Love it.  Between breakfast and lunch I have a cliff bar or two, just to keep me from munching on unhealthy snacks.  Lunch: School food here at college isn't terrible, but normally I resort to making two PB&J's ( I love PB&J's), another large glass of milk, and a banana.  Dinner: . I do either one of two things for dinner. Chicken breasts from the store, or a burger from the college cafeteria. Pretty much anything over 800 calories filled with protein fits the bill for me.  Thank you guys for reading all of this. I appreciate all the kind words and help you've given me along the way. I'll do my best to answer any questions you have below!!  ","Solid 6 month progress. Probably want include routine, diet, etc.",529
5busdb,"So after almost 3 years of lifting I feel proud enough to share my journey with you all. [Here's the transformation for those who don't like to read all about it](http://imgur.com/SRLiqaI) **Where everything started** I was always the scrawny kid. I played soccer since I was 6 years old and was pretty athletic - but that was it. I was about 130 lbs (59 kg) at 5'7'' (170 cm) when I turned 18. After finishing high school in Germany, I was given the opportunity to go to the US for a year and work as an intern. During that time I started something called Freeletics, a german bodyweight / cardio program, which promised great muscular results after 12 weeks. I completely neglected my diet and even lost weight during that time. I quit about half way through and decided I had to gain weight no matter what it takes. **Going to the gym in the states** I started going to the high school gym (the high school my guest families kids went to) about two or three times a week, where we followed a training regime given to us by the gym coach. He actually thought I was an exchange student for about half a year, haha. It was pretty much a full body powerlifting workout. We deadlifted, squatted and benched, doing a few acessories here and there. I was really lucky to have proper guidance from the start, so I didn't waste a lot of time doing uneffective workouts. He also drilled us to eat a lot. I pretty much used myfitnesspal from the get go (shooting for 3500 kcal in my first year) and bulked to about 148 lbs (67 kg). I think I benched 185 lbs (84 kg), squatted 250 lbs (113 kg) and deadlifted 275 lbs (125 kg) when I left the states. **Back home** Back in Germany I moved out to study in a bigger city about 4 hours away from home. Now I could cook for myself and go the gym without relying on someone to drive me! I was psyched. I started a PPL routine, but soon switched to a classic upper lower split, due to schedule issues. I just couldn't make it to the gym 6 times a week. I continue to follow this routine until today. Bench is 250 lbs (113 kg). I haven't actually squatted or deadlifted in a long time. The last time I deadlifted, my 1 rep max was 350 lbs (160 kg). Upper: Bench Press 3x6-8 Incline DB Press 3x6-8 T-bar Rows 3x6-8 Close grip lat pulldowns 3x6-8 Overhead Press 2x6-8 Later DB Raises 2x6-10 Incline seated DB curles 3x6-10 Overhead DB Tricep Press 3x6-10 Lower: Hacksquats 3x6-8 Leg Press 3x6-8 SLDL 3x6-8 Lying leg curls 3x6-10 Machine calf raises 3x8-12 Cables Crunches 3x8-12 **What my diet looks like right now** Honestly, I have never cut in my life, so I only know how to ride the bulk train. My heaviest was around 170 lbs (77 kg), but after a few months of not being able to lift I am back at around 160 lbs (73 kg) at the moment. I shoot for 3200 kcal (at least 130 g protein). A nice clean, slow bulk. Due to dairy and nut intolerances that I just discovered I have had to change quite a bit in my diet. Breakfast (800 kcal): 2 rolls with chocolate spread Glas of juice and cup of coffee Lunch (500 kcal): Toast with margerine and sliced chicken breast Roasted Sunflower seeds as a side, just to snack on Shake (900 kcal): Oats, Soymilk, frozen berries, a banana, linseeds and olive oil Dinner (1000 kcal): This varies a lot. I try to get a good amount of protein at dinner. I like stir-frying and steak with sweet potatoes and veggies, and so on - anything's allowed as along as I hit my 1000 kcal. Of course I try to sleep as much as possible. I get in about 8 hours every night, weekends vary. I am sure I could have had even better progress cutting out alcohol completely, but I can honestly say that a few beers on the weekend really didn't kill my gains. **Supplements** 5 g creatine Fish oil Whey protein (I stopped putting it in my shake when I discovered my dairy intolerance) **Final words** Can't describe how lifting benefited my life. It taught me discipline and made me much more confident. The first few months in 2016 were hard for me, I wasn't able to workout consistently due to work related stuff and lost quite a bit of the muscle. I was devasted how weak I was when I got back in the gym, but I pushed myself and started building the habit again. For me it is all about building habits. After 3 years one would think it is a no brainer to get off the couch and go the work out, but for me it is a continious struggle to stay motiviated. Eating enough is super hard for meas well and I have to remind myself everday to hit my goal, but when you're persistant and trust the process without looking to far into the future and being overwhelmed by the path in front of you, everything is possible.  Edit: Thank you all for your kind words! The Captain America comparison made me chuckle multiple times - I'm very honored. If you have any more questions about my routine, diet, etc., feel free to send me a message, I'll try to respond to everyone.","Holy shit, great job man. ",245
5cvnj2,"I'm a 31 year old female who last september finally got fed up with the way I was treating my body and my health, both mental and physical. I decided that it was time for some drastic life changes, so I joined a gym and started counting calories.   Before and after: [caption](http://imgur.com/RuUZCIc.jpg) Face before and after: [caption](http://imgur.com/bEpapsG.jpg)  Some details:   I started going to the gym three times per week, doing upper body one day, legs another and mostly cardio the third. I tried to go on hour long walks two times per week aswell in addition to the gym, just to get used to moving around.   At the beginning I started small. Lifting light and just focusing on the basic muscle groups, with help from my dear friend the internet. When 3-4 weeks had passed I added some weight and just kept at it like that.   On the days I did upper body I would mostly use barbells for every muscle group, doing 10 reps in three sets each. Leg day I mostly used machines, the same amount of reps and sets.   When I was doing cardio I started with 30 mins on the treadmill, 5.5km/h with a slight slant and then 15 mins on the eliptical. Nothing fancy, just something to get my heartrate up.   After a while I upped my game to 6km/h and 20 mins on the eliptical and after about four months I did HIIT (high intensity interval training) for 15 mins at the end of every gym session. That really did wonders for my stamina and metabolism! I usually did HIIT on the eliptical, starting with 20 sec active, 20 sec rest and then cut the resting time to 15 and then 10.   When summer came along I started cheating, skipping gym sessions and started falling back to my old habits so in august this year I signed up for sessions with a personal trainer and dietist, just to get things moving again.   In this program I did a VLCD diet the first four weeks. I lost about 20lbs. On mondays and wednesdays I do circuit with my PT and on fridays and saturdays I do my own circuit and cardio. In between that I also walk/jog and do pilates at home.   My week now:  Monday: Circuit with my PT. It varies greatly but it focuses mostly on strength and getting your heartrate way up.  Tuesday: Walk/jog 60mins Wednesday: Circuit with my trainer Thursday: Pilates at home 50mins and Tabata 10mins as warm up.  Friday: Upper body circuit and HIIT  Saturday: Legs and abs circuit and HIIT  Sunday: Rest   Diet: I started using myfitnesspal, set my calorie goal at 1800 and made sure that my macros where okey everyday. My macro goals were 40% protein, 25% carbs, 35% fat.   I cut out sugar, white bread and white pasta from my diet and only splurged on ""bad food"" on special occasions. I kept my portions small and never took seconds.  I ate three meals a day to begin with, now I eat five.   Normal day at the beginning:  Breakfast: High protein, non sugar, low fat yoghurt with blueberries and a hardboiled egg. Coffe with non fat milk  Lunch: Waterbased salad, some high fiber vegetables and chicken/fish  Dinner: waterbased salad, high fiber vegetables, potatoes/brown rice etc. And some meat product.   Normal day now: Breakfast example: hard bread, low fat cream cheese, low fat ham, bell pepper, cucumber and two eggs  Lunch example: tuna salad with beans and eggs  Dinner example: low fat ground beef, tzatziki, oven baked potatoes and veggies, waterbased salad on the side  Snacks: carrots, apples, high protein yoghurt, berries etc two times a day.   I base my meals on the following model:  One hand waterbased veggies One fist of high fiber carbs/veggies One fist of protein One thumb of fat   On saturdays I get to eat what I want. Often it's going out to a restaurant, or party or something like that. It works great if you can go back to normal the next day.   I also do guided meditation three times per week, to help with stress and focusing on my goals.

5er32k,"I'm an active gal but I loath running. I prefer literally any other form of cardio but I promised my husband that I would run a Thanksgiving morning 5K with him.  It wasn't the running or boredom I had an issue with; it was the other people. I exerted more energy dodging people and playing Frogger than I did actually running. At one point, a woman pushing a stroller knocked me over. I was physically prepared for the race but not mentally prepared for the 3,000 other people wandering 3.1 miles in a clusterfuck.  Is this normal for a 5K? To mix walkers and runners together and just let it be a free-for-all on the road or did I just happen across the most unorganized race ever? Edit: I wrote this last night and immediately passed out in a turkey-induced coma and when I woke up was amazed at all the responses. Thanks for the feedback guys!  We (stupidly) started near the back because  the crowd at the front of the gate was overwhelming. We'll try a much smaller, more organized race next time or go for a 10K. Happy holidays! ",totally normal and something you have to deal with constantly. this is mainly caused by narrow paths and or big cities with huge turnouts. here in houston it's generally like that.,1018
5ezaz7," https://imgur.com/gallery/yOFCW Background: 23 M 5'8/9?  At my highest weight I was 356 Currently fluctuate between 205 and 210. Net loss of around 150 lbs.    During high school I played football for 3 years, stopped playing senior year. I continued to lift with a friend and cousin as my gym partners. I had a passion for weightlifting my entire time through high school and was very much into trying to lift heavy. My PRs at this time were : squats 500, deads 500, bench 300, leg Press 900. I always fluctuated around 200 lbs weight wise and that would depend on if it was the off-season or not. Overall I lifted for about 5 years during high school as well as my early college years.  I was a smart kid and got into my dream school of Penn State. I started out strong but unfortunately, I fell into a very deep depression due to family health issues back home. I felt too far away, helpless, and I eventually collapsed. My stress from family health, school, as well as my continuing self-esteem issues from failure with women proved to be too heavy on me. I stopped taking care of myself, kept by myself, played video games nonstop, stopped weightlifting, and ate garbage. I stopped talking to my best friends as well. Near the end of my 2 year stay, I had ballooned and gained over 100 pounds.  My thoughts became twisted and I stopped communicating with my parents who became very worried about me. The depression eventually became too much and I became obsessed with death and dying. I wanted to end my own life and I felt powerless. I would spend a lot of sleepless nights standing at my apartment window thinking about jumping(I lived on a higher floor). The only thing that stopped me was knowing how painful it would be for my parents if I did this.  My family finally pulled the plug on me and decided I needed to be back home. The new plan was for me to go to community college and to start getting my shit together. Slowly, things started to fall back into place again. I got a part time job, started school again, and started to try and reconnect with people. I slowly started losing weight just from moving at work. After about 5 months I bought a gym membership but didn't use it. Around September 2015 I decided to go and lift weights a little bit nothing major. I tore my PCL in November so I stopped all activity.  After recovering, I started lifting with my cousin in February of this year. Something a friend said to me that stuck was that ""you just have to treat lifting like it's your job, go and give it your all. If you don't, there's no point in going"". I went every day of the week doing a 5x5 6 day split with cardio and cardio only on Sundays. I would go to the gym for an hour and a half, 45 minutes lifting and 45 minutes of cardio. At this time weight was melting off. I have since cut down my time at the gym though I still go every day.  Early Routine I never had a ""set"" routine and just used my knowledge from previous years of lifting and football workouts. It proved to work before so I stuck with it M: chest/shoulders/tris/cardio T: back/bis/cardio W: legs/cardio Th: chest/shoulders/tris/cardio F: back/bis/cardio S: legs/cardio Su: cardio only  Current Routine I now use a simple PPL routine that always has the same majors with minors cycled dependent on what I need to work on.  M: back/bis Deads 4x5, 1 AMRAP Barbell rows 1 AMRAP T: chest/tris/shoulders Bench 4x5, 1 AMRAP Overhead press 3x8  W: legs/abs  Squats 3x5, 1 AMRAP Leg Press 5x5 Th: back/bis Barbell rows 4x5, 1AMRAP Deads 1AMRAP F: chest/tris/shoulders OHP 4x5, 1 AMRAP  Bench 3x8 S: legs/abs Squats 3x5, 1 AMRAP Leg Press 5x5 Su: cardio Current lifting stats Bench: 245 Squat: 365 Deads:325 (should be higher, really need to invest in a belt zzz)  OHP: 130 Leg Press: 600   Diet At the start I didn't take my diet seriously but I still ate at a deficit. It honestly didn't matter considering how many calories I was burning from cardio, work, and lifting. I ate around 2 thousand calories a day but was burning around 700-1000 depending on work. I still remember eating a lot of fast food while still rapidly losing weight.  Now I try to eat around 1200-1600 calories since I've slowed down cardio. I eat clean for the most part cutting out almost all carbs(except for my recent increase in alcohol intake from a growth in social life) eating fats, protein, and veggies.  Water also has been my best friend as it helped to cut calories instead of sugary drinks. It also helped as I finally started to interpret thirst as thirst and not hunger.  Overall, I'm absolutely happy about how far I've come. I was staring into hell and am fortunate enough to be where I am today. My goal weight is around 170-175 but overall want to be cut so plans may change when I reach that weight. I was lucky enough to have a good amount of my muscle still. I'm still super tough on myself and get down about where I am currently but 35 pounds is a drop in a hat compared to 150. Hopefully in a few months from now I can post an update showing that I hit that goal. I appreciate anyone who took time out of their busy day to read my story. I hope that this pushes anyone out there struggling with what I went through and gives them motivation to turn things around.  If I'm missing any information or if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. I'll be as honest as I possibly can.  TL;DR: former weight lifter, gained a massive amount of weight due to depression and became suicidal. Turned everything around and  lost 150 lbs in a little over a years time. Edit: I never thought this would blow up the way it has! I'm still trying to answer all questions while I'm working and doing other things. Thank you all for such kind words it really means a lot to me. All of you are awesome!!! ","You basically transformed from a ""chubby neckbeard"" into a ""black ops operator"".",534
5gpc6l,"24 yr old. Male, 5'11"" and 179lbs. Before and after: https://imgur.com/gallery/A3hwN  I grew up being a fat kid my whole life. Up until I was about 18. I tried to avoid any kind of physical activities since I wasn't good at any sports nor interested.  Right before I finished high school, one of my friends asked me if I wanted to go to a gym with him and I just went without knowing what to expect. My first day at the gym was horrible. I remember using two 35lbs dumbbells to do a flat bench dumbbell press and thinking I was going to pass out after the 3rd rep. Since then, I've always been in and out of the gym. I did the typical bro split (chest/tris, back/bis, and etc). I didn't know what I was doing but since I was somewhat consistent, I didn't look ""fat"" anymore. Fast forward to summer of 2014, my clinical depression (got diagnosed way back in the day so I've had it pretty much my whole life) hit me harder than usual and I just dropped everything. I flunked all my classes, ate whatever &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;whenever and  slept when I wasn't eating. Fast forward to December 2014, I went to my mom's house for Christmas dinner and decided to weigh myself to find out that I gained 35lbs in span of 5 months(and I wasn't working out at all during that time so I'm assuming it was 35lbs + how much ever muscle mass I lost).  I decided that enough was enough and started dieting again on New Years. For diet, I carb cycles which worked really well with my carb cravings and 3 day split that I was running. I didn't really count my calories since I was tracking my macros instead but it usually went like this. My macros were: Day1(rest) 50c/30f/200p (1250-1300kcal) Day2(push) 150c/30f/200p (1800-1950kcal) Day3(pull) 150c/30f/200p (1800-1950 kcal) Day4(legs) 300c/60f/200p (2200kcal) Every 8th day of my high carb day, I had a ""cheat meal"" but tried to stay on healthier side instead of binging on calorie condensed food (deep fried, sweets, and etc. but I did treat myself to milkshakes from time to time). I didn't really do any cardio during my cut just because I was lazy. Routine:https://www.jefit.com/routines/workout-routine-database.php?id=22104  I ran this for a while but also took time away from dieting when I was on vacation and enjoying summer. From fall of 2015 until August of 2016, I fluctuated back and forth between 185-195. In September, I was sitting at 185, not happy with how much mass I had I decided to ""mini-bulk"" up to 195 before cutting again. I'm not sure if that bulk did much at all but I started my cut again in October same carb cycling but upping my fat to 60 per day while dropping my protein according to my body weight. Routine now: https://bodymaxing.com/2016/09/15/dltbb-routine/ I'm sitting at 179-180lbs right now hoping to cut maybe 5lbs before I reverse diet or maintain. But I'm pretty happy with my result so far. It took me longer than some people's transformation, but I enjoyed myself when I wanted to and made it work with on my own time. Someone once told me, ""your fitness journey is not a sprint, but a marathon. So as long as you stay consistent and never give up. You'll get to your destination."" And it really helped me out a lot when I was in doubt or feeling down with how I looked. Thank you for reading and again, sorry about the format and grammar. Edit: whoa, thank you all for compliments, advices and just responding in general. I didn't expect this post to blow up! Yes, my mirror is dirty... I do clean it often, but when I wash my face, I splash water everywhere... I'll clean it more often . My hair looks horrible in my before pics because they were all pre shower hair + bed hair.

I used to play video games constantly, stay up till 3am and sleep in till 1-2pm. I suffered from depression because of this and hated my body/looks and life style. I decided to suffer through the first few months of forcing food into me and training at the gym with a few friends, it was hard being so skinny and weak, I was barely benching the bar or squatting anything at all. **Persistence is key** and I can't count the amount of times I thought I was going no where and wasting time, not making progress but it was only when I looked back through photos that I realised I'd changed.  It changed me as a person, I still sometimes relapse into depression briefly but only for a day or 2 max and even then I know its something I can't control and just ride it out for the day. **Lifting** I train purely hypertrophy so I don't have any great lifts:  **Bench**: 38kg Dumbbells 4x10 **Squat**: 100kg 4x8 I can write up what I train if people are interested but its no  different than any other plan, eating is the key! **Routine** 5-6 day split (Chest / Legs / Back & abs / Arms (always lacked) / Shoulders & abs)  It's not really important what exactly you do, hit the muscle group with 4-6 different exercises of 3x10 - it's not about moving a high weight it's about a full extension and contraction, **squeeze!** Dumbbell bench, dumbell incline, flat bench, cables superset with push-ups to fail.  Squats, front squats, leg press, leg extensions, leg curls Pull ups, lat pull down, bent over row, seated cable row, close grip pull down Rope triceps, close grip bench, tricep push down, dips machine, barbell curl, dumbbell curl, preacher machine curl, cable curl  **Quick Edit:** I'm not an expert in training or diet, this is just what I train and i'm sure it isn't optimal or perfect but it gets me to the gym because I enjoy doing it. Read the FAQs, read articles/forums, try different things and find what works for you.

5hyjxn,"Pictures at the bottom if you don't want to hear my life's story (I apologize for the length)! Me: Age: 28 Sex: Male Height: 175 cm Starting weight: 137+ kg Current weight: 69 kg Goal weight: Sub 70 kg.  **The Past:**  Like so many others, I've struggled with my weight. I had tried everything (or so I thought) but nothing really stuck. Was I the problem or was it the world? I was convinced then that the world was done in such a way that everything delicious made me fat just to spite me. I was also convinced that ""it wasn't that bad"", that ""so many others are way fatter"". Essentially I didn't view myself as ""fat"" but just slightly chubby. I lost girlfriends due to this, as I simply wasn't attractive anymore and I didn't want to change. I was content with sitting in front of the computer monitor all day long and had resigned myself to that form of life.  **The Tipping Points:**  So what made me change my ways? Well several factors played in. I moved cities after I finished University in 2014 for work and barely knew anyone. This resulted in a lot of alone time in an almost empty 94m^2 apartment in front of the computer. This time was what I had looked forward to in University. No homework and all the cash to do whatever I wanted and build whatever PC I required.  However as time went on, I grew bored with the games and the series and the movies. It started feeling like everything was just a loop, that I had seen everything and everything I did was just a repeat of what I had already experienced. Since I was mostly cut-off from the outside world outside of my parents and my co-workers, I had precious little input in my life. As it turns out, even an introvert can get lonely. This spiraled into a mild depression and once I recognized the thought patterns for what they were, I sought out a therapist in the start of 2015. I started spending almost every weekend at my parents house, even though it's a 2 hour drive away, simply to not be lonely, so my parents have been a big support for me in this journey.  I am still unsure whether she actually helped me in the strictest sense, other than maybe by listening to my ramblings about nothing mattering and my total state of apathy. I suppose it helped me in the sense that I suddenly had new input that might help combat the internal feedback loop of spiraling thoughts. But we had also talked about weightloss and I was actually losing a bit of weight, strictly by dieting. I was down almost 20 kg! But it didn't last. Come summer 2015, I started eating like I used to and quickly gained back the lost weight.  September 2015 is where everything crashed. My absolutely lowest point. A few months now I had experienced some sharp abdominal pain every now and again that would last for about an hour after I had eaten a boatload of unhealthy food. I had dismissed it and not really done anything other than to take some heart-burn relief meds, as I figured it might just be that, and since the pains only lasted for about an hour, I didn't question it. However, one Sunday in September 2015, the day before my first business trip around the globe by myself, I had decided that I wanted strawberry ice cream and barbecue bones while watching some series. That of course means the entire liter of ice cream and 1 kg of bones. As I was gorging myself on these treats, I started having these same abdominal pains as before. But this time they just didn't stop. I had to call emergency services. I waited the longest 30 minutes of my life for the ambulance to come. Get to the hospital, still in immense pain, but they wouldn't give me anything for it since they didn't know what it was yet. Cue me being in pain for most of the day until they figured out what was wrong: Gallstones and Acute Pancreatitis. I spent 2 weeks in the hospital, either in immense pain or completely doped in pain killers, only vaguely thinking about the missed business trip that a co-worker had to do instead.  This visit had brought one good thing though, I hadn't actually eaten much in 2 weeks and my lust for food had dropped considerably in the following weeks. I grabbed this opportunity to start dieting again, but there was still something missing from my life. I hadn't broken out of the hell that was coming back to my empty apartment. So after some searching I found a post on my city's Reddit page, detailing a free running club. I was still overweight though and self-conscious about it, but I think it speaks volumes about my fear of the empty apartment that I actually started showing up. A self-conscious introvert that can barely move without sweating in a running club.  Whether it was the gallstones, the lack of immediate friends or the depression that drove me to change my ways, I still cannot really give an answer. All I know is the combination made me change.  **The Journey** So how did I actually lose all the weight? Well it was both diet and exercise.  *The exercise:*  To accompany the running I had started, I did a lot of walking inside on treadmills with incline on, as well as some strength training with a few friends I had from my online life, that I had only really met a few times before in real life.  I started in the running club, and damn it was embarrassing. First run which was in October, I was joined by one of the founders of the club for what seemed like an eternity for me back then, all of 500m which was all I could run before being completely out of breath. However I stuck with it and it became easier. I could suddenly run 1 km after a few weeks. Suddenly 2 km and even 3 km. In the start of February I ran my first 5k. The thing that kept making me come back was the people though. Suddenly having people to talk to and care about whether you show up or not, really made a huge difference for me. I suddenly didn't feel quite so alone anymore. I decided to push my pace since I was growing complacent. First I wanted to get under 30 minutes on a 5k. With a bit of luck and some healthy pacing from some lovely runners, I made it and it felt fantastic. I had set a goal and I beat it. Damn I was proud. I kept setting new goals for myself, and I beat my 5k record and came in under 25 minutes with some healthy competition from a fellow runner, pushing each other to do more.  Since pace wasn't an issue anymore, I decided I needed some longer runs. By the 16th of April I had done a 10km run. I didn't think it was possible just 6 months previous but there it was. The running club even made a post about it since I had started from absolutely nothing, and it just felt awesome. 14 days later, on a regular Saturday training with the club, I ran my first half-marathon in 2 hours and 5 minutes. It just felt so good. It really felt like I had found what I was missing from my life in this.  My dad had always been a runner and had for the past years run a specific half-marathon, so I figured I would join him, it was only the weekend after my first, what harm could it do? Well on the 14th km, my left foot started to hurt. I did finish my first official marathon in 2 hours and 20 min, but I had to walk some of the way. Cue me meeting a physiotherapist some days after, and it was a tendon overload injury. Basically, I had to keep off putting weight on it for 3 weeks and even then I had to start slow again. I was bummed out but it's something every runner has to go through.  So I started looking around for other things to do in between my runs so I could keep active most days without overloading my tendons. One of the girls from the running club dragged me to spinning one day to try it and I was hooked. I started doing spinning 3 - 4 times a week, even bought my own spinning shoes. I even started swimming regularly in October, also due to being dragged down there. I had been swimming a lot in my younger years, before University.  Once I was back on top with my tendons fully intact, I ran more than ever. In October I reached over 200 km. My longest run ever was the day before the operation, with 31 km.  *The diet:*  This one I cannot recommend to most people, as it is simply not healthy. I knew that when I did it but I found something that worked so I stuck with it. I consumed roughly 1200 - 1500 calories a day. This continued well into summer 2016.   Below is a usual day:  Breakfast: 250g Skyr with Pear and Banana + ½ can of peaches Snack: Apple / Banana Lunch: 200g Carrots + 100-200g of meat (depending on what the lunch ladies at work at prepared) Snack: Apple / Banana Dinner: Any low calorie meat like fish or chicken  After I was within 5 kg of my goal, I started eating more regular food and increased my calorie intake to 2000 - 2300 and allowing myself some cheat foods like pizza, oreos and gummy bears.  **The Surgery and now** I had lost 65 kg and I was ready. The surgery happened, paid for by the state due to universal healthcare. They removed 1.7 kg worth of skin, measuring slightly above 2 meters in length. The first two weeks were the worst, although the nice doctors and nurses at the hospital made it just above bearable, they were really nice and encouraging. Going from being active 6 - 7 days a week to not doing anything is not fun, and having to adjust to wearing a compression belt until sometime in February is not really all that great. But I feel fine. I am currently counting the days (28 DAYS!) till I can start doing proper exercise again, as right now I'm only allowed to walk. But with a few audiobooks, some friendly folks from the running club (or my mom!) who offer to take walks with me, I think I can pass the time until I'm allowed to exercise again.  **The Future** Right now I have a few goals for 2017: * Copenhagen Marathon 2017 * 1/4th Ironman sometime in 2017 * Start proper weightlifting routine  **Pictures** [Progress Pictures - NSFW!](http://imgur.com/gallery/XdZlI) Still a bit swollen around the waist from the surgery, but hopefully it'll subside within the next few weeks.  [Tanita Weight stats](http://imgur.com/gallery/2Jn7W) I wish I had taken more measurements with the Tanita weight during my weight-loss, but for some reason I was too scared to, even though I was losing weight. ",Nice work man.  Sucks that you're down for a month.  Good luck post recovery.,769
5lioa6,"**TL;DWTR:** After many set backs, restarts, injuries, etc. I finally reached a total weight loss of 200lbs this morning. Don't confuse that, Ive LOST 200lbs, I weigh 207. All diet and exercise, no thermo pills, no surgery, etc. It's awesome, but the loose skin sucks. [Pics for the Impatient! Each is annotated for clarity.](http://imgur.com/a/aWLXG) ***************************************** ***************************************** **Story:** ​When I was a kid I was told I would never be fat. My mom even had trouble finding pants that could fit me properly. But just before puberty I began to gain weight. By the time I graduated from High School I was ~320lbs. Started college and gain an additional 40lbs within the first 2 years. When I was 19, I was rushed to the ER from work with severe chest pains and shortness of breath, the initial thought was heart attack, but luckily it was a massive panic attack. Nevertheless, I was put on blood pressure meds and told to lose weight. Of course, I didn't do that. My Junior* year of college I moved to main campus, weighing about 390, and reached 400+ by end of the 1st year on campus.  Second year of on campus I moved with friends from back home. This was when I reached my max of 407.8lbs. It is very possible that I weighed more, but the 407.8 figure is the highest I found logged by a medical office, so it is the one I use. Anyway, one night my friends invited me to the gym and to this day I am quite sure they were only being nice to the fat guy/friend. But, for some reason I went. I picked a recumbent cycle and went about 30 minutes for a distance of about 3.5 miles. I remember distinctly thinking that I must not have been as out of shape as I thought I was. The next morning, I woke up at 7am to get ready for my 8am Psych class ... to this day, it is hte only class I ever missed for something like this. I literally could not walk. My legs felt heavy and radiated pain into my pelvis every time I moved. It was a good half hour before I was finally able to hobble done to the bathroom to pee. I was 24 years old and if someone on the floor had access to a walker, I would have used it without question.  What happened next is hard to explain, I don't really even understand it myself. My legs continued to feel better and I felt there was something that had changed in me. The idea that I did this to myself, but knowing that when it was better it would never be this bad again. Two days later, I went back. I was, once again, sore but this time I could walk. 3 times a week that first month netted me a 35lbs loss. It was enough to be my catalyst for change so I kept going. At the end of the first year I had lost 120lbs. That was 120lbs I would never gain back. As I continued to lose I got very sick and no one could tell me what was wrong. I was terrified it was undiagnosed cancer or something worse. Finally, at 30 years old a Nurse Practitioner successfully diagnosed gall stones (which has been previously ruled out by a HIDA scan). A week after the surgeon's consult, I was in surgery. I had 8 primary gallstones, all of them larger than 1/2"" with the largest being just over an inch in diameter. These are apparently common in people losing a lot of weight. The ordeal had set me back about ~40lbs. A year after that I was down a total of 165 lbs when I severely screwed my back up laying hardwood. Unfortunately, this is not a double entendre, it was hardwood flooring and I was basically in the bed for weeks, followed by physical therapy for another 3 months. After an MRI it was discovered this was my obesity coming back to haunt me. I had a lateral bulged disc at L4/5 with moderate foraminal stenosis causing a lot of pain down my left side, but no central stenosis, so that was good. With PT this resided and I have been on a strict core workout regimen to keep myself pain free. This time, I had gained almost 50lbs back. For the years after that, I yo-yo'ed pretty regularly as is the custom of most previously obese people. Mostly I stayed between 230lbs and 250lbs. I knew how to drop weight, but hadn't yet learned how to properly change my lifestyle to the point where I could keep it off. But it would come in time. Fast forward to now, I am 38 years old, I have surrounded myself with friends who are active and supportive. They understand the struggle I have been through and refuse to let me fail. I have finally trained my family to not throw out the ""But you're skinny, you can have a couple bites."" or the grandma favorite ""You're getting too skinny, you need to stop losing weight."" These things combined has helped finally move my head into the mental space where it needs to be to be successful on a long-term basis. I also think switching to the concept of ""getting better"" (lifting, looking better, etc) versus ""weigh less"" helped a lot too. The scale is a good tool, but if you start lifting and you aren't obese, it is a poor indicator of your overall success. Thirteen weeks ago I hurt my shoulder. It is the first upper body injury I have had in my life. Before the aforementioned mental shift I would have rested and recovered. But not now. As such, I merely changed my habits to accommodate this injury. I talked to my doctors and physical therapist to develop a short term program where I can workout, but with minimal shoulder involvement. I work legs 3 times a week and cardio the other 4, usually a stairclimber for 30-60 minutes. leg exercises avoid loading the shoulders/traps with significant amounts of weight. The doctors assure me that I'll be back to lifting soon. ***************************************** ***************************************** **Diet:**  I have basically been on all of the options at some point. Low-fat is where I started, then moved to high-protein for a stretch. After about a year of yo-yo dieting, I adhered to a strict ketogenic diet for nearly 3 years. I cut about 45lbs off on keto, not much for 3 years, but I lost it and kept it off. For the last ~9 months I have switched to a IIFYM style of eating, which is, in my humble opinion, the best out of the various options.  I eat roughly 2500-2600 calories a day when actively lifting and trying to put on muscle. During cuts, I drop to a crazy, but effective, 1600-1700 calorie/day diet that is heavy on protein to help maintain lean mass. Protein always stays at, or above 195g/day. I think due to my history of dieting and focusing so much on weight loss I need the ultra low calories to be effective in dropping fat, 2000/day doesn't seem to help me drop weight. When I move back to a lifting caloric load I have to do it slowly over a few weeks, otherwise I get really sick to my stomach and seem to pack on fat quick. ***************************************** ***************************************** **Exercise:**  My approach to fitness is functional with a heavy slant on looking decent. So I guess I want to just look like the classic ""male."" Im not in the gym to impress or break records (other than my own). Due to some former fattie issues I can't really deadlift, so I rack pull and dumbell Romanian DL instead. I can squat, but Im still working on form for BB squat, so I do a heavy amount of DB goblet squats. As for bench, I prefer incline over flat, and as I mentioned earlier, before the injury my PR was 2 sets of 5 at 185lbs. When lifting I run a 6 day split.  * Monday is Chest/Tricep  * Tuesday is Core/Legs  * Weds is Back/Bicep  * Thursday is Aux/Cardio  * Friday is Shoulders * Sat is Legs.  As I said previously, I like the stairmaster for cardio, but I also jog and use the spin bikes at the gym. Currently, due to my injury, I do ...  * Legs on Monday * Cardio/Core on Tuesday * Legs/Light Chest on Weds * Cardio on Thursday * Light All Over/Cardio on Friday * Legs on Sat.  I also hike when I can with a light pack to prevent loading my shoulder too much. ***************************************** ***************************************** **Tech:**  I have religiously worn a Polar M400 for the last 2.5 years, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Only taking it off for the few hours needed to recharge it every 2 weeks or so. I love it and it serves well as a motivator and it reminds me to get up and move. *FYI I like to remind people that if you use some sort of tracker tech, remember to update the weight it uses for calorie calculations, as you lose, to make sure you're getting as accurate a count as possible.* ***************************************** ***************************************** ​**Aftermath:** ​I honestly don't know how to feel about it. Part of me wants to shout it from the rooftops. Part wants to cry in a corner in happiness. And the other part of me says, ""Ok ... whats next?"" The biggest downside to the loss is the massive amount of loose skin I have remaining. I probably need to drop about 5 more pounds, 10 at the most, and the thought of more skin disgusts me. To have come this far and still not be comfortable taking off your shirt at the beach or even in the locker room kind of sucks. Unfortunately, there isn't anything that is going to fix it for me but surgery. Most of mine is covered in scar tissue left over from the many many stretch marks I developed. Much of the scar tissue has faded, but it doesn't magically revert to skin.  As an example, under my arms, from the armpit to down on my torso, it literally looks like I've been burned. I've been told by doctors there isn't anything they can do for that other than remove parts of it and tighten it up. But those parts aren't really saggy enough to have removed, I can always put muscle on under it. But around my abdomen, I will never have a V taper (much less visible abs) without having the skin removed. Then, naturally, the docs follow it up with the sticker shock of $8,000.00 - $10,000.00​ (or more)​.​ Also the fact it is a very, very, painful procedure that possibly will result in small numb patches of skin around my lower torso.​ C'est la vie I suppose. ***************************************** ***************************************** ​FAQs, stuff Im just going to go ahead and answer now to save responding later because people always ask the same stuff: * Did you use surgery or chemicals? >​No. No gastric bypass or lap bands. No thermogenics, appetite suppressants or stimulants aside from caffeine. In fact, I only tried pre-work for the first time about 1.5 months ago.​ Sheer Strength in Cotton Candy flavor is by far my favorite and gives me the best results of the one's I have tried. * ​Is your penis bigger? >Ok, get the giggles over with. It's a common question, one you would assume is usually asked in a hushed whisper. But, I can't even count the number of people who so nonchalantly ask this question in public. Is it actually bigger? No. Does it LOOK bigger, absolutely. I probably gained about 3"" of visible penis​. I was also told by a urologist that the higher testosterone from having lost weight can create a ""plumper"" flaccid penis as well as firmer erections. * ​Which is the best diet? >Highly subjective and depends on you. Keto was very effective in the short-term, but got very boring, very fast for me. However, it kept me very strict knowing that I couldn't eat carbs. For your average person, I would recommend using keto for quick cuts when you need to strip some fat, but if you're not going to stick to the diet for at least 8 weeks, don't bother. Otherwise, just do IIFYM and keep your protein at an adequate level for your lean body mass.​ * Did you ever consider suicide? >I don't think a person can be as large as I was and not at least consider it, if only in passing. Luckily for me, I am tall, so I was able to carry the weight without losing significant mobility. I couldn't hike a mile uphill, but I could get across campus without feeling like I needed a ventilator.​ So I never really felt like my life was over, more like it was slightly impeded. But yes, there were times when it crossed my mind, a few even involved loaded weapons being close. **If you are morbidly obese, just overweight, even if you are a genetically-gifted aesthetic God/dess and you are considering suicide, PLEASE get help, there are lots of options for help, regardless of where you are in the world. You might think suicide will stop what you currently are feeling, but it also robs you of everything you could be. In the US you can call 1-800-273-8255, 911, or go to the nearest Emergency Room. Also, [here is a list of Suicide Prevention orgs in various countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)** * ​Who do you see when you look in the mirror? >I don't see the ""new"" me, but I also have been small enough, long enough, that I don't see the old me either. I guess I see some amalgamation of the two ... maybe ""small-ish"" is a simplified but adequate term to use.​ * What would you do different? >Screw cardio, that's what. There was a period where I was doing 1-1.5 HOURS of cardio 6 days a week and after the 1st month I would stall hardcore. At the time, most people were afraid of fat and preached low-fat and cardio for weight loss. As such, if I could do it all over I would have went straight weight lifting and super light cardio. The only upshot to all the cardio I did is that I have excellent cardiac vitals now. 105/65 blood pressure and a resting pulse of ~52 bpm. If I am really rested it can drop into the upper 40's. Plus, I can out cardio the 18 and 19 year olds I currently workout with. * What isn't a con of the weight loss, but more of an annoyance? >Clothes. I can't imagine how much money I've spent on clothes or the amount of larger clothes I have given away. I desperately need new jeans right now, but I refuse to buy new ones because I know if I drop another 10lbs or some miracle happens and I can get the surgery this year, they will be useless. Also shirts ... Large for the Upper Torso, XL for the lower spare tire of skin, guess which size wins out? XL, every time. So I look like 5lbs of flour in a 10lbs sack on my upper torso and 11lbs of flour in the same 10lbs sack on my lower. * Do you do anything weight loss related with your experience? >I am a non-practicing psychotherapist/counselor. One of my goals in 2017 is to finally set up shop as a weight loss/sports/eating disorder counselor. Perhaps even look into providing support for new bariatric patients. * What's next? >First I need to get my shoulder healed up. I went from an Incline Press of 185lbs for reps to basically feeling like the bar is going to crush me within a day. I have a friend who is a personal trainer, we trade skills ... I get workout/form help from him and he gets diet/macro help from me. He and I have been discussing where to go next for me. First of all, I need to get my upper body strength back, 12/31 was 13 weeks since the injury so I've lost a lot of size, especially in my shoulders. Once I get back to where I was, I'd like to continue on the path to wherever it might lead. I doubt I will ever compete or anything, too damn old for that now, but as they say ... age is just a number. I always wanted to do the Mammoth Cave trog tour, but even after dropping 200lbs I've realized my normal chest size is beyond their max diameter, oh well. I guess, if I had to name something I'd like to do off the top of my head, I'd like to climb a mountain. Maybe Mt. Elbert or Rainier?​ Something with proper snow and requires a bit of technical climbing.​ I'v​e ​always been a bit of an armchair mountaineer.  * Any tips or tricks? >Crockpots. Get 2 of them and constantly be using them. You can have pre-measured, hot food, anytime of day with maybe 20 minutes prep each night. Plan you crock pot meal so that you can eat the entire thing, throw it in around 10pm and cook overnight on Low. I do chicken breasts and beans (kidney, black, chili, or green beans for lower calories) alot, or even chicken/beef chilis, or just slow cook a ton of meat to use for other stuff. You can also opt to make extra then freeze/refrigerate leftovers as you go to build up a small selection of take-along meals. ​If anyone has any other questions or comments feel free to ask.​ EDIT: *changed Senior to Junior, Senior year was when I started. EDIT 2: I really want to keep responding to everyone's comments but Im about to pass out. I'll try to respond to everyone tomorrow. EDIT 3: Some people have questioned my height based on the girl standing next to me in one photo. 1. She was a college basketball player, she is abnormally tall. 2. Maths ... Check the wall behind us. Standard building block height in the US is 8"" high. There is exactly 9 rows of blocks from feet to the top of my head, that is 72"" (6') before even adding in mortar seam height. Giving .25-.33"" per mortar seam, which there are 8 of, gives an additional 2+ inches, making 6'2"". Clearly there is some play with shoe sole thickness, mortar thickness, and overall camera angle.

5llljo,"Hey folks, i've made a super quick wrist warm up that you can do anywhere and it shouldn't take longer than a minute. Personally, i use it when i've rested for half an hour time between climbing sessions and don't want to spend another 10 minutes on a long wrist warm-up before continuing. It's really effective for all kind of activities that put strain on your wrists and grip. * It's pretty easy: Extend your arms, elbows straight, now a fist with your fingers and extend your fingers explosively. * Repeat this exercise with flexed wrists, extended wrists with both - internally and externally - rotated arms. * Now bend your elbows and repeat the exercise with flexed and extended wrists. Done! * It takes about a minute to do, is quick and gets the blood and the synovia flowing. **[You can see a demonstration here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF-RHMI-Oo0)**. I hope most of you don't know this quick exercise yet and will find it useful. :) I've got some questions for you aswell: * Do you warm up your wrists before grip-heavy lifts? * If yes, how do you usually warm your forearms and wrists up? Happy new year!",I'm a single teenager who lives without parents. My wrist is never not warmed up.,348

5oxnv2,"**Background:**  I have always been in pretty good shape due to the various sports I played while growing up.  Then in college the gym became my stress relief, the place I would go to get away from the stresses of work, finals, whatever.  I made great friends there, and always enjoyed the various associations I made there.  That was until I got married in September, 2015.  I'd still go to the gym once or twice a week, mostly by myself and sometimes with my wife, but most, if not all of my healthy habits started to diminished very quickly.  Over the course of 2016, my marriage started to crumble and became very toxic.  I was the most unhealthy I had ever been in my entire life, in every category.  I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating right, I started to struggle at work, I was emotionally fragile, and spiritually shattered.  It was obvious to everyone but me.  I eventually came to see what was happening, and decided that enough was enough.  I filed for divorce in September, and it was finalized on December 22. **Plan**  I figured that since I had 90 days to basically wait in limbo while everything was processed by the courts, I would take this time and try and get as big and strong as I could, basically just to give me something to do and work towards.  Here are the [results](https://imgur.com/gallery/DA6x1).  I didn't do anything crazy, but followed the advanced part of [this routine](http://www.myprotein.com/thezone/training/push-pull-legs-routine-best-mass-building-workout-split/) almost to the letter.  I'd never done a PPL routine before.  I really liked it! I didn't do a very good job of counting calories or macros.. But on an average day I'd eat around 3000 calories.   Breakfast *oatmeal and a banana Lunch *was completely random each day, as I eat out most of the time...  Dinner *Almost everyday was 2 chicken breasts, 3 golden potatoes and a protein shake. **Gains** My starting weight was 180 and my weight at the time of the pictures was 193.  My peak weight was 196.5.  I've since been sick for about 2 weeks and have settled back to about 185..   I've never tried to do a bulk before, so I really didn't know what kind of results to expect, so I'm not sure if this is good or not, but I feel great!  I plan on getting more serious about the nutrition side of things as I go forward, because I know it's important. I wish I had done a better job of documenting my starting lifts..  Since I hadn't really lifted seriously for at least a year, I think that accounts for why I gained as much strength as I did.  I probably awakened a lot of the strength I used to have too.  I remember going into do flat bench and struggling to put up 185.  Last week I did 3 reps of 265!  Most I've ever done.    The  biggest gains by far were in my self esteem and confidence.  Getting out of an unhealthy situation and putting myself into a healthy one.  I am much more confident now.  I smile more.  I laugh.  And I sleep better than I have in a long time.  I'm happy with myself again.  Don't ever settle.  Especially if you're in a shitty situation.  Thanks r/fitness for all your help!  ","You can definitely market a fitness program after this.

5pwxki,"#**What is a foam roller? How does it work?** * A foam roller is a large, cylindrical self massage tool. You roll over this cylinder and the pressure of your own bodyweight helps to knead your muscles and relax large areas of your body. So, that's why I have one. It's like getting free massages for the rest of your life. * # [Link to video tutorial on how to use the foam roller.](http://youtu.be/miFbBqZ_Zj8?list=PLOj76wV2WfPuiHYrXTYsRQ67xfOJTcNd0) ## **Foam Rolling GIFs** I also made looping GIF's with my doggie to help save you time. * [Upper Back](http://gfycat.com/CooperativeImpracticalGrassspider) (avoid lower back; edit: [read here why](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5pwxki/foam_rollers_and_lacrosse_balls_are_awesome/dcukorl/)) * [Neck](http://gfycat.com/NastySomeCanadagoose) (not meant to be aggressive) * [Calves](http://gfycat.com/RemorsefulHandsomeHarrier) * [Shins](http://gfycat.com/OccasionalLameChafer) (lateral side to get anterior tibialis) * [Quads / Hip Flexors](http://gfycat.com/CircularLastHatchetfish) (bent legs and/or straight legs) * [IT Band / VLO / Hip](http://gfycat.com/AcidicCanineHornshark)  **Note:** I like to do 10 passes for each body part. However, you don't *have to* constantly roll back and forth. Sometimes, just putting pressure on ONE tender spot and holding it for 30-60sec is effective, too. --- ## **What is a lacrosse ball? How does it work?** * When someone gives you a deep tissue massage, they use their palms/fingers/elbows to apply pressure to help relax tight muscles and make you feel better. A lacrosse ball is a fairly hard, dense ball about the size of a tennis ball that helps mimic this deep release massage with your own bodyweight. It allows for much more localized pressure than a foam roller. * # [Link to video tutorial on how to use a lacrosse ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUjoQuJ36OU&index=5&list=PLOj76wV2WfPuiHYrXTYsRQ67xfOJTcNd0) * The best part is that you could go to town on your **glutes and hamstrings** in a way that not even many massage-therapists will because of how intimate that area is. (When was the last time someone FIRMLY massaged your ASS? Right?)  So thats why I have one, to get free ass massages, haha.

This works extremely well for the glutes and triceps and many other areas. **Lacrosse Ball Alternatives** * If you don't have a lacrosse ball, you could use a tennis ball, baseball, softball, billiard ball, cricket ball, floor hockey ball, golf ball, spalding bouncey ball as alternatives. They don't work as well as the lacrosse one in some cases, but it's better than nothing and sometimes it may even be better! With the combination of a lacrosse ball and foam roller, I can practically massage most of my body and the best part is, **these don't take up much room and I could easily travel with them,** *especially* the lacrosse ball.

5qteyq,"Hey /r/fitness, i've always wanted to be able to do the middle splits like Van Damme, but (no surprise) when i started training i was as flexible as a brick. About half a year ago, i decided that i still want to go and try to learn the middle splits and researched the internet for various middle splits routines. Since there's plenty on the internet with many different approaches, i put my own routine together. A portion of my routine consists of stretches that i learned from the [Focused Flexibility](http://www.gmb.io/ff/) program from Gold Medal Bodies. It's a full-body self-assessment program that shows you your flexibility weaknesses and makes you work on them on a day-to-day basis. Half a year later, i've made [tremendous progress](http://imgur.com/a/BkluW) - i did this routine 3x a week. So, instead of keeping this to myself i've made a follow-along video out of it, so you can try it out yourself and join me on getting those middle splits. *** * Start all practice with the [Horse Stance](http://i.imgur.com/xz4gqH2.png). I prefer 30 seconds, but you can aim for a minute or longer. It's a wide squat position that really prepares your legs for the split position. * I continue with a [Hamstring Stretch](http://i.imgur.com/mCe8BI5.png) where i sit on my one leg and extend the other one in front of me. Now switch between dynamic contractions and static holds, while you lean forward. It's like PNF stretching where you switch between contracting and relaxing. * Third stretch is a [Kneeling Lunge](http://i.imgur.com/9qXYFhL.png), where you again dynamically contract and relax into the stretch. Get the angle between the front leg and the back leg wider while you relax. This also prepares you for the front splits. * Fourth exercise is a [Butterfly Stretch](http://i.imgur.com/jtXkx05.png), where you sit on the floor and place your feet against each other. Now you rotate your hips outside to get your knees to the floor. This stretches your adductors really good. You continue this, by afterwards laying on your back and extending one leg into the air. Now let it [rotate outside](http://i.imgur.com/EqzNim8.png) and hold it there - pulling it towards a split position. * Next exercise is the [Frogger Stretch](http://i.imgur.com/hE7hpXw.png), where you form a 90° degree angle between hips and torso, and also between your legs and calves. Spread those hips on the floor and rock back and forth. With relaxation, you will be able to widen the stretch between your legs. * Last exercise are the [Middle Splits](http://i.imgur.com/CC1km1n.png) themself. You spread your legs and start to hold a comfortable, light stretching position for 30 to 60 seconds. Afterwards, you deepen the middle splits and repeat. Once you have done so, you hold the deepest you can go for 10 seconds (without support from your arms). * Done! You can repeat this routine every other day. Personally, I find that i need a day's rest afterwards. See the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyuBbYx28sg) for visible explanation of the exercises. *** So, i hope this will help some of you to get back to their dream of achieving the middle splits. I've got some questions aswell, to start a discussion and hear you guys' opinion on this: * If you got the middle splits already, how did you train for them? * Have you given up on learning the middle splits? If so, why? Do you want to start again? # Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyuBbYx28sg",Do you do any kind of warmup before stretching? ,227
5rbh33,"[Here's the progress that I have made](http://imgur.com/a/Uq16s) I wanted to lose weight for a long time.  Ever since I started 6th grade I was very insecure about my weight and the way that I looked.  I always thought that maybe I would just grow into my body and get better looking when I got older.  That was not the case.  After my first semester of college I was extremely depressed, my father had passed away about a half a year before that and I noticed I was laying in bed a lot wallowing in my own self pity.  I was morbidly obese, I was convinced that I would be alone forever and all I could do was lay in bed and go to school.  I finally got the motivation and courage to ask my mother if she would be willing to get YMCA passes for the family so I could start losing weight.  For a while me and my whole family were going to the gym.  Soon, everyone else gave up but I kept going.  I LOVED IT.  Both cardio and working out, the feeling that I got afterwards was amazing, it was like being high but better.  I've been going to the gym since January 20th of 2016, I remember the date because it was the time I started to really turn things around in my life.  I've never felt better and I plan on continuing to better myself.  My final goal weight is 180 pounds but my current goal is 220 and I'm almost there.  Then it will be 210, 200, 190, 180.  This subreddit is something that got me going too and I wanted to show you lovely bastards what you did.  Thank you. I started off doing SL 5X5 but after about three months of that I moved on to a lot of different workout routines that I can't remember off the top of my head but the most recent one I've started is PPL. On Mondays and Thursdays:  Triceps, Shoulders and Chest  On Tuesdays and Fridays:  Biceps, Traps and Back  On Wednesdays and Saturdays:  LEGS  I also do about 30 minutes of cardio everyday.  At least 10 minutes of running on a treadmill, never less than that and the rest of the time I do cardio on a bike.  When I first started out tho I did 30 minutes of nothing but an elliptical, I thought it was a way of bitching out of running on a treadmill at first but I found it to be very effective.  By the end of the first 2 weeks I had lost 14 pounds.   EDIT: Thank you everyone, it means so much to me that you all left these kind words.  I recently have started feeling more and more confident in myself and this just solidifies my confidence even further.  I wanna become the best version of myself and I plan on doing it with you guys.  I'll update as I progress further.   A lot of people have also been asking about my diet.  I have no real extensive diet plan, all I try to do is eat a decent amount of vegetables with a decent amount of high protein meat like chicken and I was going at about 1500 calories at first but had to increase the calories during the spring of 2016 because of plateaus that I kept hitting.  But when the weight is coming off I try to stick to about 1500 calories a day consisting of pretty much veggies and meat, no real specifics there and I'm sorry for that but it's not something I plan too much considering I am pretty busy most of the time and have no time to prepare my own food as I have work, school and the gym to attend.  Sorry, I know when I first started losing weight I would come here to find out good dieting techniques but to tell the truth the thing that works best for me is basically eat less food, also cut out soda entirely as well as sugar and other junk food.  Good snack foods are things like almonds and walnuts and other nuts like that.  I pretty much never eat breakfast anymore because I have to wake up early enough for my classes.  That's pretty much it though.  Thank you all so much for the kind words.  It feels amazing for people to call me an inspiration to them.  There is truly no feeling like it that I have experienced.  ","You're hot. Sincerely, a girl.",1019
5rjsjm,"I'm training for the Arnold Sports Festival Raw Powerlifting Challenge in early March and this is a giant milestone i've ran across along the way. I've been trying to get to this point in my powerlifting career for several years now and am happy to finally have deadlifted 700 pounds!! Here's the video below (I do a 700 pound block pull first, then 700 off the floor second, so please watch both): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnLmFGUxQ9s I figured i'd post a bit about my training and diet here as well. **Diet** I overshot my intended goal weight of 231 pounds a couple months ago and am currently several pounds over. While before I was eating pretty much everything, I've started watching the amount of fat and carbs I've been eating much more closely. I've cut out most unhealthy foods like shakes and donuts whereas before I would freely eat these foods to garner energy for lifting and to put on size.  While I'm moderately attentive to my carb and fat intake, I am extremely concerned with eating enough protein. I try to average about 1g of protein intake daily per pound of bodyweight (therefore aiming to consume 234g protein daily).  **Training** I recently changed my training from 3-4 days a week to 4-5 days a week to accommodate an additional bench day since the lift seemed to be lagging behind. This has been a lot more taxing that I thought, but I figure it's worth the effort if I want to do well at the Arnold. After all, the Arnold will be my last powerlifting competition as junior (ages 20-23) and I'd like to maximize my strength. I set my training up so that several months out from the meet I was doing hypertrophy work (work to build muscle which will later be conditioned). I gradually tapered towards lower reps and sets to condition my muscles. Currently, at one month out, I am doing 2x2s and 3x3s.  I bench twice a week now; one day is a heavy day where i'll do 2x2 or 3x3 and the other day is typically lighter and a bench accessory like close-grip or using boards. If you have any questions regarding powerlifting or any critiques, please post here and I'd be glad to comment!

5ssn6s,"I'm 42, got back to the gym after my divorce because it was my refuge during my teens and early 20s. However, I spent much of my 20s and all my 30s not going to the gym. During those days if I was talking about six plates it was likely a reference to the last Chinese or Indian buffet I visited.  I was a college football player (small school, DIII), so I had a decent frame underneath all the weight I gained during almost 20 years of sedentary life. Even still, that first trip back to the gym was humbling. I struggled doing pushups. My knees gave out when I did lunges. My squat form was shit (I blame my old coaches, but they were teaching me what was the norm back then).  Plenty of times I felt like stopping, this is stupid, you're not as young as you used to be, your body can't do this anymore, etc, etc, etc. But I kept after it. Eventually, my knees stopped hurting, and pushups got easier, and I started to build strength. I had a few setbacks, a herniated disc in my neck put me out of commission for much of last year. But I kept going back, and once I got the all clear from the doctor, I was fully back at the gym, working my way back up the ladder.  Yesterday, when working on my one rep max, I finally got back up to 3 plates on each side of the bar. Something I hadn't seen since my junior year in college. It felt good to push that weight up, and to see the younger guys at the gym give a side eye glance at me and the bar after I racked it. Yes, I saw you looking. And I grinned. My routine wasn't anything spectacular. Just strong lifts 5x5 to start and then modifying to a 4 day split. I'm there maybe 45 minutes total, so it's not a major time commitment.  Older guys, younger guys, gals, people, basically if you're healthy, it's never too late to get back to the gym. Don't think you need commit to a 6 day routine or anything overly time consuming. 45 minutes, 3 or 4 days a week. You've got that time. tl/dr I benched 315, needed to tell someone. **1st EDIT** Apparently I need more information. **Starting weight:** 270 (November 2014) **Current weight:** 225 (As of this morning) **Current sex:** I'm still a guy **Routine:** My routine began with Strong Lifts 5x5, then I moved on to a 4 day routine. I mix up the lifts a bit every 8 weeks or so, trading out some exercises when I hit a plateau. [Here's a screengrab of my last 7 weeks](http://i.imgur.com/Oi1gILM.png). I ruptured my Achilles tendon 4 years ago, so my legs are still a work in progress. I also did the occasional cardio (mostly elliptical due to my knees and achilles). **Chest & Biceps**   Bench 5x5   Incline DB 3x6-10   Cable Fly 4x12-20   Standing DB Curls 4x5   Conc Curl 3x8-12   Hammer Curl 3x10-15   **Back & Abs**   Pullups 4x6-10   Rows 4x6-10   DB Pullovers 3x8-12   Lat Pulldown 4x10-15   Decline Crunch 4x10   Cable Crunch 3x20   **Legs**   Squats 5x6-12   Leg Press 4x8-15   Rom Deadlift 4x6-10   Leg Curls 4x8-15   Calf Raises 5x6-12   Calf Press 3x10-15   **Shoulders Tris Abs**   Military Press 4x5   Lat Raises 4x8-12   Bus Driver 3x10-15   Skull Crushers 3x6-10   Tricep Ext  3x8-12   OH Extension 3x10-15   Hanging Leg Raise 4x12   **2nd EDIT** Apparently you guys need to know what I ate as well.  I used MyFitnessPal to track my calorie intake. Roughly consumed between 1800-2200 calories a day, with the occasional trip to the Indian buffet on a cheat day. No supplements, didn't really track macros either. I just tried to eat sensibly and avoid the midnight pizza deliveries. Midnight pizza deliveries still happened, just on rare occasions. **3rd EDIT** Apparently (some) of you guys think my routine defies the laws of time and space. I go to the gym on my lunch hour at work. I get an hour for lunch, but I'm salary so if I get back in 1:05 or 1:10 it's not that big of a deal. It's a five minute drive to and from the gym, plus time to change and shower. I really only do 90 to 2 minutes of rest between sets, and I occasionally will superset lifts (abs and pulldowns for example) so I'm not standing around too long. I never have to wait for equipment because no one is there at lunch.   When I say it takes me 45 minutes, that's the time I'm in the gym, it doesn't include drive, change, shower. Hopefully that clears it up.",I'm jelly. 3 plates was my ultimate goal way back in the day. I got to 305 for 2 reps but never got the 315. Seems like shooting for the moon now. ,517
5utz8e,"This was recently posted on [/r/bodyweightfitness](https://redd.it/5nd91p) and it turned out to be supremely helpful for most people because one of the most common bottlenecks people encounter when trying to follow our [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) is figuring out **how to start doing rows at home.** With this video I show you all the options you have for doing them with minimal equipment so that there are no more excuses about this! #Video: https://youtu.be/rloXYB8M3vU My favorite minimalistic way is to simply get a bedsheet, make a knot at the end of it, throw it over the door, close the door shut, hold the sheet and row, row, row your boat! The lower you hold onto it, the harder it will be. By the time you max out this progression, hopefully you will find an alternative (like a pair of rings), but you could also do **one-arm rows** with this setup and it works *very* well! This way, nobody has excuses! ","Yo dude I just watched your video about the right way to do push ups and holy shit it was helpful. Before I could barely do one, but after watching your video I can do 4 (I'm weak as fuck I know lol). Thanks!",429
5w7a4v,"[Here's the pics.](http://imgur.com/a/0IQCr) The only decent gym in my area charges $50 per month and it's always packed, so I figured i'd try building a gym for the price of roughly a one year membership (~$600). Here's the rundown: * Standard weights (220 lbs), dumbbells, ez bar and standard bar on CL - $100 * Olympic weights (400 lbs), olympic bar and pair of 35 lb hex dumbbells on CL - $200 * [Olympic bar from Amazon - $70](https://www.amazon.com/CAP-Barbell-Olympic-2-Inch-Chrome/dp/B002OOYINA/ref=sr_1_4?s=exercise-and-fitness&ie=UTF8&qid=1488065079&sr=1-4&keywords=olympic+bar) * [Power Rack from Amazon - $200](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N4I8FOY/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza) * [Bench from Amazon - $100](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OHQALU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) * Floor mats - $80 * Weight stand from play it again sports - $25 * 5 54x24 mirrors on CL - $40 Total - $815 I went a bit over my budget, but I might still end up selling some of those Olympic plates.  I justified the extra I spent by telling myself I can always just sell most of this stuff on CL and still end up with a relatively minimal loss compared to what I originally bought the stuff for. For anyone thinking about doing something like this themselves, I can't recommend mirrors enough.  Not only do they let you look at your magnificent self while you lift heavy things, but they're terrific at both adding more light to the room and helps you keep your form in check. If I had to do it all over again, I think the only thing I would do different is buying the heavy duty floor mats instead of the jigsaw ones.  You can tell they're cheap and they seem like they're already breaking down a bit.  I'm going to buy at least one to put underneath the Olympic bar i've got on the ground there. I'm also probably going to buy a pair of dip handles and something to tag onto the side of the cage to hold the rest of the weights i've got stacked in the corner, so I can use that space for stuff like curls and resistance band exercises.",May the gain gods bless your gym.,1970
5wvmeb,"Hey athletes of /r/fitness! Archer Push Ups are a great exercise for your chest, triceps and your deltoids, so i made a video tutorial for them. They are quite easy to learn, if you watch out for a few form cues, so i hope you enjoy it. If you don't want to watch the video, i'll also include an explantion below. * For the archer push ups, **[you start in a plank position](http://imgur.com/ByQ4CDi)** and externally rotate your arms, while keeping them about double-shoulder width apart. * **[Hand positioning in the upper part.](http://imgur.com/0EbN9yv)** * Now you lean to one side, while keeping the other arm completely straight. **[The bottom position should look like this](http://imgur.com/VvD1kxu)** While you do so, internally rotate your arm and keep your elbow close to your body. * **[Hand positioning in the bottom part.](http://imgur.com/tmmLnX8)** * Now you press up into the starting position, while keeping the elbow of the straight arm completely straight. Repeat to the other side. * Form cues: You need to keep your straight arm completely straight at all times, or you're doing a biceps exercise - which isn't the goal of the archer push up. You want to train your chest, triceps and your deltoids - and this is best achieved by having your elbow straight. This way, your biceps and brachialis aren't activated as much. This also makes the exercise much harder! * A good way to build up to archer push ups is, by starting weighted push ups and work up to 20%-30% of added bodyweight. Once you are able to do 2-3 reps with that weight added, you'll find negative archers easily achievable, and real archer push ups aren't far away. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and find it helpful to achieve this new cool skill. :) I've got a few questions aswell, to start a discussion: * If you can already do them, what progression did you use to learn archer push ups? * Have you tried archers before and failed to keep your arm straight? What was the reason? # Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91e47oNbSdA","Yeah, but how will this help my squat? ",996

5yf1oj,"I’ll start with everyone’s favorite part, the pictures. Caution, shirtless fat guy inside. Don’t say you weren’t warned, lol:   http://imgur.com/a/1VJ8r Statistics:   6‘2“ Male   Starting - 301lbs, BP 135/95, resting HR 90, Doctor was concerned about my cholesterol, 38.6% BMI   Today – 200.5lbs, BP 118/62, resting HR 55, completely clean blood panel and an amazed Doctor, 25.7% BMI Let’s flash back to 6 months ago. It’s the beginning of September, my now ex-wife asked me for a divorce while I was running for political office, was stuck in a rut at work, and everything felt like a chaotic mess. The walls were closing in, my future was over, etc. There were a couple of really dark weeks at this point. Suicide was legitimately considered and “planned”. Didn’t leave the apartment for a couple of days. Then something happened. I really can’t say what it was, but I decided to just...do some stuff I had planned on doing for awhile. I cleaned the apartment, tried to constructively reach out to my ex (didn’t work, but amenable divorce was finalized in February), and actually got a promotion at work. But relevant to this post, I decided to fix my diet and start doing CrossFit. I actually went from 290 to 210 about 5 years ago, but I did absolutely no exercise, hit the low point weight but still looked fat. Was super discouraging, ended up meeting my ex around this time, and just got lazy. My ex was also on the larger side, and we just settled into a routine of buffets, movies and inactivity. This time was going to be different. I had been reading various health related subreddits ( /r/loseit /r/fitness /r/crossfit etc) for a bit and had gleaned some “rules”. 1) Eat less to lose weight, exercise to be awesome. Not looking better was super discouraging those few years ago. 2) No food is off-limits, it’s all calories in/calories out. Managing Keto for me back then was a nightmare. I can’t stand food prepping. etc. 3) Don’t keep junk food in the house. If I really want ice cream, I have to put on pants and drive to get it. This was another struggle back when I first lost the weight. 4) You can only do so much damage in a day. 4000-5000 calorie binges derailed me the first time around, and they existed early on this time around too. Just realizing that I could just get back on the wagon and barely have taken a step backwards was huge. There was plenty of other tidbits and mantras that did and continue to keep me going, but these were the big ones. Now for the specifics:   As number 2 says, I downloaded MyFitnessPal and started logging. I set a calorie daily goal of 1500 a day, no routine cheat days (if they happened, fine, but it was because of un preventable circumstances, not something I depended on), and did not factor in exercise. An example day of eating would be nothing for breakfast (never been a breakfast guy, so I intermittent fasted for most of the last 6 months), a Lean Cuisine (350ish), a Yogurt cup (100ish), a pack of Starkist flavored tuna (100ish) and a banana for lunch (650ish calories), a chicken breast and very large serving of veggies (usually mushrooms or spinach) for dinner (600-700ish calories), and a protein shake mixed in somewhere depending on when I did my workout (300ish calories).   I am now sponsored by a company here locally that does chef prepared, never frozen, calorie and nutrient controlled meals. The meals are delivered to my gym Mondays and Thursdays. I eat around 600 calories for lunch and 600 calories for dinner, then supplement another 200-400 calories with things like protein shakes and bars. Meals can range from herb roasted chicken and a baked sweet potato to bison chili with braised greens as a side. Currently on the Paleo meal plan. Yes, they’re a sponsor, but they’ve GREATLY simplified my food life, I never have to cook anymore, and I’m eating foods I’d NEVER cook on my own. If you can afford it and have a quality local company, I’d definitely recommend signing up for a fresh meal prep service. As for fitness, I initially started with 3 CrossFit classes a week, M/W/F, with all other days being pure rest days. I was super interested in CrossFit because it seemed like the perfect weightloss routine, covered my programming and got cardio in (which I’ve hated since HS football) while primarily being weight lifting (which I love). I read all the horror stories, watched all the YouTube fail videos, and listened to all the advice to just hit a gym and lift. But I also heard from friends that had done CrossFit with a solid, knowledgeable coach. So I went out and found one. Tried several gyms, probably close to 10 around me, before finding the one I’ve been using since. My coach has a couple of degrees, almost every CrossFit certification, and has been doing it for a long time. My first day, he told me to put the bar down during Front Squats after watching me and said, “We won’t be touching that again for awhile, that going to be okay with you?” Knew I found a good place. Since then, I ramped up to 5 days a week after a month filled with DOMS, to 6 days a week attending Sunday’s Olympic Weightlifting class with Saturday as a rest day, to where I am now, training 10-12 times a week. Current routine is an intense cardio routine in the morning at 5AM (training for a marathon, so usually at least 5K distance pushing for faster mile times. Have a marathon training program I’m following). When I hit goal weight, this cardio will scale back and involve weight lifting once I’m in a calorie surplus. Then, after work, I go to CrossFit at 5:30PM and complete the day’s programming. This is M-F. Saturday is still a true rest day unless I have a 5K/10K or a CrossFit competition, then Sunday becomes the rest day. If I don’t have any of those, Sunday is Olympic Weightlifting training.   Starting Fitness Stats:   Max Back Squat - Struggled with body weight (old football injury complicates this), Deadlift - 175lbs, Benchpress - 85lbs   Today Fitness Stats: Back Squat - 255lbs, Deadlift - 375lbs, Benchpress - 215lbs I know this has gotten super long, so I’ll wrap up here and answer anything I missed in the comments. I love talking about my journey and I’m considering going into personal training once I hit goal weight, not sure on that end yet. Been using my social media feeds to chronicle my journey and hopefully inspire others. Not sure if I can post them, will edit them into here if someone says it’s okay. Long term plans are potentially personal training, competitive powerlifting and competitive CrossFit. Since I started in September, I’ve competed in 3 CrossFit competitions, completed my first ever 5K, my first ever 10K with a sub-hour time, and my life has radically changed for the better. I know I saved myself from an early grave, and I’m going to try to make the most out of this extra time.   Thanks for taking the time to read all of this if you’re still here. And thanks for being a part of a community that has changed my life so fundamentally. ",Wow man way to go!! This is super inspirational! Get into anything you wanna!

5ym51i,"Hello Reddit. Before I start this thread I'd like to thank everyone on here who's helped me. I have private messaged a lot of people with questions on pretty much everything, and you've all been wonderful. So thank you for that! I'd also like to apologise for the length of the post. Starting off, I was diagnosed with anorexia at the age of 11. I skipped the entire final school year of primary school and was generally in a really dark place. Fast forward to 18. I had just left an emotionally abusive relationship, and I weighed just 44kg. Yes, 44kg. I could barely eat, let alone go to a gym. I had never touched a weight ever, I barely had energy to do anything. The measurements: Age: 18 Height: 5'11"" Weight: 44kg (not a typo) https://imgur.com/a/bynPD This was 5-6 years after ""recovery"".  Since then I met a girl. I actually smiled, for the first time since I could remember. Despite my social anxiety, my eating anxiety and general mess of a human being that I was, her and her family took me in. It took me 3 years of forcing down food to eventually get to the below: Age: 24 Height: 5'11"" Weight: 61kg https://imgur.com/a/dVbTx I still only weighed 61kg but still hadn't been to a gym yet, that was what I wanted to do next. I did a bit of research and eventually started on the 5x5 SL on M/W/F with rest in between. This was the most I could manage, I ached, I was tired but I wanted this. I wanted this more than you could imagine. I started of off barely being able to finish a 5x5 squat with just the 20kg bar. Squat: 20kg OHP: 2x5 12kg Deadlift: 20kg Bench: 3x5 20kg Barbell row: 3x5 15kg I realised 3 months in that I was no longer as small as I was. I was eating anything I could find, aided with 3 shakes a day of the MyProtein ""Hard Gainer Extreme"" shakes to help with the bulk. I had trained hard, but had got to a surprising point in my life. Age: 25 Height: 5'11"" Weight: 69kg I had finally put on the weight I wanted, and I could see a light in the tunnel. The pain I went through I proved to myself that I could do. I didn't need to prove it to anyone else, I needed to show myself (All 5x5) Squat: 60kg Deadlift: 57.5kg OHP: 25kg Bench: 22.5kg Row: 20kg https://imgur.com/a/PeeHF And this pushed me further, to when I'm writing this post now. It's 10/03/17, and I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life. Aged: 25 Height: 5'11"" Weight 75kg https://imgur.com/a/Dk7Vx (All 5x5) Squat: 75kg Deadlift: 72.5kg OHP: 32.5kg Bench: 40kg Row: 40kg I now have told myself what I can do. I've shown myself what I can do, now I'm going to show everyone else what I can do. Since the start of all this, I've met a girl. Got engaged, had laser eye surgery, started and finished university, got a 8-5 job, saved up enough for a 10% deposit for a house with 6 months left, and shown myself that I'm not as pathetic as I thought I was. I hope this post shows a few lurkers out there that it's possible, it's definitely possible. Compared to 90% of the people on this sub I'm weak. But I won't be for long, because I won't let myself be for long. Thank you Reddit, stay beautiful. Obligatory happy picture! https://imgur.com/a/2GFUa ",I think it's so important for you to share your story as anorexia is often portrayed as an affliction faced only by women.

Was originally just going to share our last cut progress (1.5 months), but decided why not the full journey so far --- First, progress pictures!

Estimate would be 300 Lifts now: Bench: 260, Squat: 350, Deadlift: 460 [Bonus flex picture](https://imgur.com/a/Q2crv)  --- Background: We’ve been varsity athletes for the past 5 years. We actually **have** had short stints of weightlifting in the past; in 7th grade (12 years old) for two semesters for 45 minutes a day, the first semester of freshmen year for an hour twice a week (football conditioning, though we both quit before the season), and the summer before our senior year for an hour twice a week (track conditioning, the sport we’re varsity athletes in. They added conditioning during our senior year). Just wanted to start off by saying this because posted before and got a lot of skepticism so wanted to clarify early ---  Training: It was pretty variable at first. The first two months, we didn’t even deadlift because our main gym didn’t have it (hence the weak deadlift in comparison of the other lifts at the beginning). Still not on a reddit program but we have a structured routine now Abs whenever we feel like it. Mostly 2-3 times a week of a high intensity interval training just abs, and 1-2 times a week of weighted decline sit-ups for a few sets. \+ means supersetted All of the weights go increasingly higher. We train to failure. We recognize we could get more volume if we didn’t, but both of us enjoy doing it to failure. That’s just what works for us. --- **Day 1** Barbell Bench Press (5x5) up to 225 Dumbbell Incline Press (4x8) up to 80 lb dumbbells Dumbbell Flat bench (3x12) up to 65 pound barbells Pull-ups (3xfailure) (around 15 each set, last one ~12) **Day 2:** Standing overhead press (4x8) + Barbell Bent-over-rows (4x10) up to 105 Dumbbell Shoulder shrugs (4x25) + Stiff-legged Dumbbell deadlift (4x5) up to 110 Dumbbell Curls (4x8 (each arm)) + Dumbbell Bent-over-rows (4x8) up to 70 Hammer Curls (3x15) up to 30 lb dumbbells **Day 3:** Squat (5x5) Up to 315 (Yup, that's all for squat day. Though squats are almost always abs too) **Day 4:**  Same as Day 1 **Day 5:** Dumbbell Overhead Press (5x8) up to 120 + Dumbbell shoulder shrugs (4x25) up to 105 Barbell Curls (5x5) + Barbell rows (5x8) up to 100 Dumbbell hammer curls (3x15) up to 30 lb dumbbells **Day 6:** Deadlift (2x5, max out at 460/435, then 3x5, or just 5x5) up to 375 **Day 7:** Rest (if we feel like it. Otherwise just repeat) --- Diet: IIFYM. Generally eat healthier during cuts or otherwise we’ll starve. Generally eat less healthy during bulks because otherwise can’t get in enough food. We’re college students with 2 meals a day so we make do with what we have. Oh, and also allergic to nuts, peanut butter, and all fish so that eliminates a lot of snacks people suggest. Pork rinds are a life saver. And coffee with Splenda. Only macro goal was 140 grams of protein a day. ---  Final points: Just wanted to wrap up the post with some advice - Diet matters a lot. Was basically spinning our wheel for the first month because we continuously ate like shit while working out. We’d say it’s about 50/50 gym/diet. We don’t even eat incredibly healthy; just get your protein in and count your calories. Don’t drink soda unless you’re realllly below on calories during a bulk or drinking diet (might get crucified for this but if it wasn’t for artificial sweetners, every other day would’ve been a cheat day) - **COUNT YOUR CALORIES**. Unless you eat the same thing every day. Mentioned in the last point but honestly think would look almost exactly the same as the before pictures if we didn’t start counting them. It’s a 5 minute a day commitment, it’s not that hard. -  Don’t make yourself miserable with your diet. We see a lot of people say “eat 0 grams of sugar, only drink water, and the only carbs you should eat is rice, oatmeal, and those from vegetables”. If that works for you, great! But if either of us were to stick to that, we would’ve quit within a week. Find a healthy balance -  Consistency is key. Just go and stop making excuses. If you hate it, find something else. Fitness is a lifestyle and you’re not going to stick to a 4-8 hour commitment of something you despise. Find another physical activity you enjoy. Swimming, rowing, calisthenics, rock climbing, biking, sking, skateboarding, biking; there’s dozens upon dozens of different options. Just pick one and be consistent!  --- Edit: [I've been told to add our leg picture here, because of our low volume, we have chicken legs.

My friends have repeatedly told me, if I improved my posture, I'd appear more taller. But, it's tough. I noticed on other posts, practicing good posture isn't initially instinctual. It's a constant reminder. Even right now, I'm studying and I notice I hunch over my desk, and my lower back will slouch. And tbh, it feels better/comfortable to slouch while I sit on my computer chair, than straighten out my lower back.  So, what did you do reddit fitness fam to improve your posture? I was told some suggestions from a friend (go to a chiropractor, do yoga, swimming, lose weight).  Thanks for reading! Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this much support.

Starting 9 months ago I go to the gym at least 10-12 times a week, usually cardio in the morning and weight lifting at night.

This has really been a spiritual journey for me, because I have been over weight my whole entire life. I got laughed at, made fun of, and got joked about and it never felt good, then years passed by when i got my first job and they hosted a weight loss competition and I was like you know what lets try it and finally had the courage to sign up for a gym membership. At first it was going good and lost 60 lbs and felt impressed with my self, the results came in and i lost and felt devastated and lost motivation. My friends still encourage me and said ""you know even though you lost you still lost 60 lbs which is incredible you should still keep trying!"" and I was like ""you know what? you guys are right!"" So I tried going back, but it felt different, I didn't feel the same motivation as I did before and I didn't last long and kept on failing over and over and started to slowly gain my weight back and was depressed and went MIA. because I felt so ashamed. Years passed by and I moved to Saint Louis to work at my cousins restaurant to start my life anew, to find myself and then one night...I skyped with one of my best friends and when I saw him I was so shocked, because he been trying to get fit too and he looked amazing, he progressed so much and I was like wow....and we talked and he gave me good advice encouraging me and etc. All night I was thinking ""wow....I'm really jealous, think i could've looked like that? what if I never gave up, what if I actually stayed on tracked..I don't think I can do it.."" but the next morning something happened..I felt something different inside me and I was like you know what....I don't wanna feel this way anymore! No more What ifs! I'm going to get my ass up and go back to the gym! The first week there....I finally felt it...the motivation that I had before except this time it was stronger, this time I'm not going to give up, I won't fail this time, I'm going to turn those dreams into reality and I felt an endless amount of motivation flowing inside of me and was able to push my self beyond my limits and even surpassed my weight goal of 200 and got to 190 and i feel great! I made a facebook video telling my whole story here, because I want to encourage people to never give up and achieve their goals! https://www.facebook.com/ChrisKittavong/videos/1497362106954441/?l=8153277874841881366 No matter how many times you fall, always find the courage to stand back up again and keep pushing forward! I know I still got ways to go, but I promise I won't stop here and will keep on going strong because I do have some loose skin that I need to convert to muscle now and I won't give up! *Never Give up, Believe in yourself!* *sorry for any grammar mistakes above* and I will take any tips available to help me lose some of the loose skin and I know I won't be able to completely get rid of it all, this is what i currently look like now http://imgur.com/T1YXoRa  ",Hey dude I used to work with you in Smyrna.

64r9pi,"# Routine Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_sHL0WXZDs Hey athletes of /r/fitness, i created a short Squat Mobility Routine that you can do daily to supplement your leg and hip flexibility. It's bodyweight only, so you need no equipment. It will still benefit your lifting when you have problems with squatting. To be able to do it, you should be able to sit comfortably in a deep squat **(or put a block under your heels)** and have 5 minutes of time. Feel free to do it in the morning, or after your workouts. If you don't want to watch the video, i'll put a description below: * You can put a block or a book under your heels if you can't squat all the way down yet. * Start by deep squatting for a minute. * Now do 30 seconds of bumping squat movements. Afterwards, do another 30 seconds, but rotate your upper body in the process. * Place your arms behind your back and rotate your hips open and closed, until your knees bump softly against each other. Repeat for 30 seconds. * Now you place your hands in front of you and lean forward until your elbows touch the floor. Bring your butt up into the air in the process. Afterwards, move back into the deep squat. Repeat for 10-20 times. * Next exercise are pistol and cossack extensions. Place your weight on one foot, extend the other leg into front or sides - while you use your extended arms as counter-balance. Repeat for 10 repetitions for each leg. * Last exercise is the forward lean. Lean forward and place your hands behind your legs on the floor. Stay in this stretch for 30 seconds. You're done! Thanks for trying out my routine! I hope you like it, and i hope you will improve your squat with it! I would like to ask you guys some questions aswell, to start a discussion. So here we go: * What do you usually do to improve your squat flexibility? * Do you think hip mobility is important for lifting? Edit: Since some of the comments mention missing the video link above, [here it is again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_sHL0WXZDs)!",Oh god. I did the 1 minute in the squat and tried to move to squat bounces...did 3 and was done. I apparently have a long way to go with hip opening,785

677fbl,"Hi all, For the past 6 months i set a target of moving my bench from 2 plate to 3 plate and last month i finally achieved it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJhJxi9THR8 My Family and mates were kinda 'meh' about it....so i crave the glory from those who actually understand the achievement to go from 2 plates to 3. My next goal is to turn it into a competition acceptable lift (pause), and have a crack at a local meet for the 3 lifts. Going from 100kg (225) to 140kg (315) took a variety of approaches.   ##100kg >> 120kg## I used Negatives (with spotter arms) for 2 weeks to get my body used to lifting 120Kg and i just smashed out the volume, benching 3 times a week. Most of my bench days included strength reps in the 5x5 range and then pending how i was feeling, i might throw in 3x10 finisher sets. I complimented my bench days with  * Incline bench/incline flys (DayA, DayB) * Chest cable fly/Chest fly (DayA, DayB) * Tricep pulldowns * Tricep extensions ##120kg >> 130kg## **FOAM ROLLING**:  Started foam rolling as a 15 min pre warming before every session...can't recommend this enough to anyone lifting heavy weight.  I swear by its ability to reduce injury and aid in recovery * Example chest roll https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKMwQDMShc * Example Shoulder Roll https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QL9_k2loX8 * Example Upper Back Roll (Lacross or hockey ball really good between shoulder blades - each side of spine) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF58M-25CoM For chest, i'd spend about 10-15 on these rolls....then i'd move into a  * wall stretch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yJ1357Hj5M Then id do  * warmup sets 40kg for 5, 60kg for 3, 80kg for 2, 100 for 1 etc etc - depends where you are Got my self a PT who is very good in the Powerlifting community and taught me heaps. Really focused on form and technique, programmed with more strength and volume work. Added in Floor presses which helped my lockouts ##130kg >> 140kg## When i could hit 130kg for 1 rep, i used smolovjr and managed 135kg in the first round and the magic 140kg in the 2nd. Smolovjr gets a bad rep, but my body responded well to it....and more importantly, i listened to my body and didn't push anything if i wasn't up to it. Also i have retested my 1RM a month later and have retained my strength from the 'peaking' style of the program. Anyway, looking forward to continually improving on my bench :D Note: i was at the gym 6 times a week, so my 3 day a week bench was also complimented with squats, deadlifts, back etc. **Edit:** Feeling the love from the /r/fitness community, thanks internet bros **Edit2:** I'm actively trying to answer everyones questions...hope i have not missed anyone. Also added Foam Rolling mention above ""FOAM ROLLING:  Started foam rolling as a 15 min pre warming before every session...can't recommend this enough to anyone lifting heavy weight.  I swear by its ability to reduce injury, increase mobility and aid in recovery""","Woot woot! Congrats! Such a great accomplishment!!! Persistence, discipline, and dedication really pays off. Good job, man. Nice work! Keep getting stronger brah",451
67iu4u,"There's one thing I encounter pretty frequently when browsing /r/fitness (and pretty much any online lifting/fitness community) that bugs me from the scientific perspective. Most people assume that everyone is more-or-less average:  sure, there's a range, but the range is reasonably small except for maybe some incredibly rare outliers. This assumption plays out in a variety of ways. 1) Is someone still pretty weak after two years of training?  Well, they're just lazy. 2) Did someone make exceptional gains in a progress post?  Well, they must be on steroids. 3) Countless threads where the poster is asking a question along the lines of, ""I heard that when I did 'x,' 'y' was supposed to happen.  When I tried 'x,' 'y' didn't happen.  What's wrong with me?"" Here's the deal, though:  you can be a long way from average while still being perfectly normal.  The assumption that people cluster really close to the average (for pretty much anything related to lifting, at least) is wrong. Let me give you an example. I recently snagged a huge dataset with all of the USAPL's competition results since 2008.  I was curious to see whether someone's level of strength is predictive of how quickly they'll continue gaining strength (we assume that weaker people predictably have a pretty easy time getting stronger, whereas stronger people take a lot longer to see meaningful progress).  So, I narrowed it down to the people who showed up in the database multiple times, and calculated their average rate of strength gains per day. When I plotted every *individual* result, there was actually **almost no relationship** between how strong someone was and the rate their strength increased between meets.  However, when I grouped people together by strength level, *group* averages were almost perfectly predictive of how quickly someone could gain strength. You can read about all of that in more depth here to see that dichotomy graphically.  The difference is pretty striking, really:  **[Group Data Don't Tell You Much About Individuals](http://gregnuckols.com/2017/04/24/group-data-dont-tell-much-individuals/)** Here are a couple other examples from published research: [#1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7794282_Variability_in_muscle_size_and_strength_gain_after_unilateral_resistance_training) HUGE sample size (585 people).  On the same training program, average increase in muscle cross-sectional area was 19%, but there were people with increases of 50%+.  Over 1/3 of the people gained muscle at less than half the average rate, while quite a few people gained muscle at over twice the normal rate.  Ditto with strength.  Average increase in 1RM was 54%, but quite a few people had increases of 100%+ and a lot had increases of less than 25%. [#2](http://jap.physiology.org/content/102/6/2232.long) Also a pretty big sample (66 people).  In this study, they grouped people based on how well they responded, with low responders being roughly the bottom 1/4, high responders being roughly the top 1/4, and modest responders being the middle ~half of the group.  The low responders didn't have a meaningful increase in muscle fiber size, and the high responders made *double* the gains of the typical modest responder. In both of these examples, you can see a lot of people who were a long way from *average* but who were still perfectly *normal.*  The second study is a particularly good example – the high responder and low responder groups weren't anomalies – they combined to make up almost half of the subjects! If I'm trying to get one thing across in this post, this is it:  **average** and **normal** are two entirely different things.  ""Average"" is a single point and ""normal"" is a range.  Crucially, it's a MUCH bigger range than most people expect.  The range of perfectly normal responses to training is enormous. I'm not sure how much this post will change the day-to-day conversation in this sub, but hopefully it'll help at least a little bit.  If you're making slower gains than average but you're training your ass off, don't worry about it too much – you're below average, but you're still normal.  If you are a lot stronger than most other people, you may be better than average, but don't get too big-headed about it – you're still normal (unless you're winning world championships, but that's not going to apply to many people here). **Focus on what you can control**, advise other people to focus on what they can control, and let the results take care of themselves.  Those results may differ substantially from *average* results, but that's...normal.","Well one of the big problems on this sub is that we don't know any of the individuals, so we give advice based on the average. Granted everyone will respond different but I cant see all of what \u\COCKSMASH69_420BLAZEIT does so I give him advice based on what works for most.  The rest is just confirmation bias. We see people making glaring mistakes so most assume whoever is posting is doing the same.",745
68vj4c,"Hello All, Wanted to take some time out to share my experiences with /r/fitness since this sub has provided me so much useful information and inspiration.  I have tried dieting more times in the past than i care to admit. I always lose some weight and then would yoyo back up to my starting weight or higher. I could never stick to a diet for more than about a month or so. I was a D1 football player years ago, so i knew how to lift, and how to train.... but i didnt know how to be healthy, and how to manage my nutrition. I had lifted off and on for the last 10 years or so since i quit playing, but i never got serious about being back in the gym.  As i am writing this, my daughter is 3 years old and i also have a 2 year old son. To go along with my beautiful fiance and my two step sons at 6 and 8.  I was always overweight, but in the last few years it was spiralling out of control. last summer and fall i found myself extremely unhappy with who i was becoming. I would literally bring sweat rags with me anywhere i went so i wouldnt soak through my collar... i was having trouble with simple tasks like tying my shoes, or playing any sort of athletic sport. I also was constantly too tired to play with my kids when i got home from work. I just chalked it up to being tired from a long day, but it was more than that. i have a desk job... i should not be this tired.... I desperately did not want to miss out on my kids childhood because i couldnt take care of myself. And i dont want to die and miss them growing up. And most importantly i dont want my poor lifestyle choices to hold them back.... i want them to be outside playing and having fun, and not stuck inside with tv because i wont go out to watch them. I started doing research in november to figure out what i was going to do. I wanted to take my time and formulate a plan that i could stick to once and for all. after several weeks of studying and thousands of hours and blogs researched, i decided i wanted to try the keto diet.  I know the keto diet is controversial, but i had done my homework and i knew that the low calorie diets had failed for me in the past. I want to point out that i dont claim keto is the answer for everyone, and i never try to push it on people. I think that when it comes to diet, everyone is different, and its important to find hat works for you individually. Whether its iifym, paleo, vegan, low fat, low calorie, or keto. I think that the key is finding what works for you and having the resolve to stick to it. For me this has been KEto. the diet is basically high fat, moderate protein, and low carb. It isnt atkins.... because its high fat. the idea is that the higher fat consumption will help satiate and keep you from having cravings or binging. There is also alot of studies surrounding the medical benefits of a ketogenic diet.  So once it was decided what diet i was going to do, all that was left was to start. I decided to start the Monday after Thanksgiving. November 28th, 2016. I gave myself the one last holiday to enjoy and then started. I considered waiting through the holiday season and starting the new year.... but i knew there would always be a reason to wait and something coming up... so i just started. I have always been competitive, and knew i would need results to stay motivated... and i would need aggressive goals to keep working towards.  So i set a 3 month weight loss goal of 100 pounds lost... and a 6 month goal of 150 pounds lost. my 6 month date happens to fall on memorial day. On February 28th... my 3 month mark, i was down exactly 100 pounds. I hit the goal dead on. I was motivated to keep working. My training: at first i really only walked. i did long dedicated walks, but i also just walked whenever i could... whether it be taking smaller loads to the trash or smaller handful of groceries.... anything to get a few hundred more steps in. after a couple of weeks i started going to the gym.... boy was i out of shape. Most days i was lucky to last 30 minutes....  As the weight came off, my endurance began to grow... before i knew it i was starting C25K (around the 2 month mark)... and i was lifting for longer and longer in the gym. I had settled on a 4 day gym split doing a push/pull routine. I did light legs on my pull days to not wear my legs out so i could continue doing cardio in the evenings.  At the 3 months mark i decided to up my protein and start getting more serious in the gym. I decided to switch my routine and i started with a modified Wendler 5/3/1 program. Basically i was just doing a couple accessory lifts every day in addition to the base program. I have now been doing this program for two months.  As far as health goes... my life has changed dramatically... I was on 2 different blood pressure meds... cholesterol meds... and was pre diabetic.  I am now off all of my meds and completely normal A1C.  The Numbers: 131 pounds lost (at 5 months mark) 12 belt notches lost 5x t-shirt down to 2x as far as lifts i wont post starting because most of the ""gains"" were noobie gains from getting back in the gym finally. bench: 325 squat: 435 deadlift: 485 these lifts continue to increase dramatically week to week. I expect i am nowhere near my potential yet.  Calories consumed: december: 1915 cal/day january: 1528 cal/day ... 44 workouts february: 1687 cal/day ... 36 workouts march: 1732 cal/day ... 32 workouts april: 2083 cal/day ... 31 workouts Here is a recent side by side photo from me in the gym this morning vs me in the summer: http://imgur.com/cg8egWS here is an album of other progress pictures from throughout the journey: http://imgur.com/a/IXRO3 Im not posting this to try to convert people to Keto... and i know alot people have strong feelings one way or the other about it. I do think it could help some people who struggle with traditional diets. But i am not trying to be pushy. I more so just want to share and let you all know what has worked for me and to say thanks for all the inspiration i have gotten. I decided at the 100 pound mark to begin chronicling my weightloss journey for anyone who was interested and i really just want to share my experiences. I dont claim to be an expert or anything... just a guy who was changed his life in a short amount of time and am available for anyone who has questions about how. thank you,  EDIT: i'm 6'5"" .... the pics were from 5 months before i started so i gained a little more weight... there is more pics and shirtless pics (beware!) from right before i started on my instagram.

6a73yi,"[NYT article: Why Everything We Know About Salt May Be Wrong](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/health/salt-health-effects.html) > The salt equation taught to doctors for more than 200 years is not hard to understand. >The body relies on this essential mineral for a variety of functions, including blood pressure and the transmission of nerve impulses. Sodium levels in the blood must be carefully maintained. >If you eat a lot of salt — sodium chloride — you will become thirsty and drink water, diluting your blood enough to maintain the proper concentration of sodium. Ultimately you will excrete much of the excess salt and water in urine. >The theory is intuitive and simple. And it may be completely wrong. >**New studies of Russian cosmonauts, held in isolation to simulate space travel, show that eating more salt made them less thirsty but somehow hungrier. Subsequent experiments found that mice burned more calories when they got more salt, eating 25 percent more just to maintain their weight.** [JCI paper one: High salt intake reprioritizes osmolyte and energy metabolism for body fluid conservation](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/88532#SEC3)  > Natriuretic regulation of extracellular fluid volume homeostasis includes suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, pressure natriuresis, and reduced renal nerve activity, actions that concomitantly increase urinary Na+ excretion and lead to increased urine volume. The resulting natriuresis-driven diuretic water loss is assumed to control the extracellular volume. Here, we have demonstrated that urine concentration, and therefore regulation of water conservation, is an important control system for urine formation and extracellular volume homeostasis in mice and humans across various levels of salt intake. We observed that the renal concentration mechanism couples natriuresis with correspondent renal water reabsorption, limits natriuretic osmotic diuresis, and results in concurrent extracellular volume conservation and concentration of salt excreted into urine. This water-conserving mechanism of dietary salt excretion relies on urea transporter–driven urea recycling by the kidneys and on urea production by liver and skeletal muscle. **The energy-intense nature of hepatic and extrahepatic urea osmolyte production for renal water conservation requires reprioritization of energy and substrate metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle, resulting in hepatic ketogenesis and glucocorticoid-driven muscle catabolism, which are prevented by increasing food intake.** This natriuretic-ureotelic, water-conserving principle relies on metabolism-driven extracellular volume control and is regulated by concerted liver, muscle, and renal actions. [JCI paper 2: Increased salt consumption induces body water conservation and decreases fluid intake](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/88530) > A 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased urine osmolyte excretion, but reduced free-water clearance, indicating endogenous free water accrual by urine concentration. The resulting endogenous water surplus reduced fluid intake at the 12-g/d salt intake level. Across all 3 levels of salt intake, half-weekly and weekly rhythmical mineralocorticoid release promoted free water reabsorption via the renal concentration mechanism. Mineralocorticoid-coupled increases in free water reabsorption were counterbalanced by rhythmical glucocorticoid release, with excretion of endogenous osmolyte and water surplus by relative urine dilution. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake decreased the level of rhythmical mineralocorticoid release and elevated rhythmical glucocorticoid release.

6d9bdr,"[**Progress Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXHonzhxjho)  Edit: Just read that I'm allowed to post a video if it's in relation to the post, check it out! It summarizes my progress. --- ##Hi Reddit! I shared my progress pictures with my family and friends yesterday. I got nice comments that I thought to write about my fitness progress so far in more detail here. --- ##**Stats** --- + Height: 5'11"" / 180 cm  * Age: 16  * [**Progress pics**](http://imgur.com/a/6BzWC)  * Starting weight: 125 lbs. / 57 kg  * After weight: 152 lbs. / 69 kg --- ##**Initial motivation** --- I always wanted to go to the gym. I was weak and quite underweight. I could only do a few pushups and only one proper pullup. I browsed /r/fitness and /r/bodybuilding a lot but never really got around to it. There was a gym in my town but it was quite expensive €38 per month without a free weight area. ---- ##**Training** --- I started off doing bodyweight training only. My town did not have any fitness parks to workout at. Instead I used different school playgrounds as my main workout area. As the exercises became easier I either added weight through a backpack full of boring school books or moved on to a harder progression which you can see below.  Exercise | Before | After | -------- | ------ | ----- | Pullups	| 1x	| 3x7 +5kg (+12kg bw) | Dips	| 2x	| 3x10 +8kg (+12kg bw) | Rows	| 3x4	| 3x10 one arm incline rows | Pushups	| 3x5	| 3x12 +20kg	| Squats	| 3x12	| 3x8 +10kg single leg squats| Lunges	| 3x8	| 5x20 +40kg | Abs	| 30 sec plank	| 3x10 hanging leg raises| Sprints | 5x40m | 10x90m	| ######Basic Workout Breakdown:  This is a basic example of what my average workout looked like. Some days I'll sub in different exercises, but this will give you a good starting point. For example once I got to 15 reps on pushups for 3 sets I either added weight through a backpack or moved onto diamond pushups.  Workout A| Workout B| Workout C | --------- | --------- | --------- | Pullups 3x5-10| Dips 4x5-10 | Wide Pullups 3x5-10 Dips 3x5-10| Chinups 4x5-10  | Dips 3x5-10 Rows 3x8-15| Weighted Pushups 4x5-10| Rows 5x8-15 Pushups 3x8-15| Pause Rows 4x5-10| Pushups 5x8-15 Squats 3x15-20 | Leg Raises 4x10-15| Squat Jumps 3x5 Walking Lunges 3x15-20 | Hill Sprints 50m x8| Lunges 5x15-20 --- ##**Diet** --- I usually eat whatever I want and I make sure to get enough calories and protein at the end of the day. But I know people on r/fitness always want the full package so below is an example of what my diet looks like on a school day.  Meal | Example |Calories| Protein |  --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |  Breakfast | 3 Scrambled eggs, turkey ham, oatmeal and a glass of milk| 850 | 39 | Lunch | 6 Sandwiches: 2x cheese, 2x PB, 2x ham and a glass of milk | 1050 | 34 | Dinner | Ground beef with potatoes and veggies | 700 | 30 | Snack | Bowl of quark, a banana and a handful of walnuts | 400 | 27 | --- ##**Supplements** --- I didnt take protein shakes, BCAAs, ZMA, etc. Simply because I could not afford it. The only supplements I have taken daily and will continue to do so are:  + Vitamin C * Vitamin D  I feel like that's all I need for now. As my budget increases, I might consider experimenting with taking other supplements. --- ##**Sleep** --- I know and feel sleep is important. School requires me to get up at 06:30. This is why I am in bed 22:30 Sunday to Friday. I religiously sleep 8 hours at least and about 8.5-9 in the weekend. --- ##**Habits** --- I now workout three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I can't remember a moment in my life dedicating to something and being consistent with it before I started fitness.  I also wake up and go to bed at the same time almost every day. Before I would wake up one day at 10 am and go to bed at 2 am.  Last but not least I changed my way of eating from around barely 1300 calories a day to 3000 a day which was necessary for the gainz to be made. --- ##**Conclusion** --- Starting to workout has been the best decision in my life so far. I have changed my habits and I have probably laid a good foundation for the rest of my fitness and life journey. I am feeling much happier and more productive in general.  Training wise I came to the conclusion that weighted work is much easier to program progressive overload allowing you to see more consistent gains. Due my dedication my brother bought me a gym membership. The past weeks I started with barbell squats and deadlifts. I missed out on so much ~~fun~~ leg gainz. ---- **Edit 1:** Thanks for the nice comments everyone. I've always been paying attention to school and performing well. Only thing that changed is that I am able to do more pullups now.  **Edit 2:** I'm new to Reddit. Someone gave me a month's worth of Reddit Gold. Can somebody explain Reddit Gold to me?  **Edit 3:** The workout is supposed to be done three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Each workout takes about 50-80 min. For example 3x12 stands for 3 sets of 12 pushups. ","The fact that you're 16 and showed this much dedication deserves massive credit. The amount of people I know that complain, ""Oh, I can't afford the gym"" or ""I don't have weights,"" is ridiculous. You put them to shame hahah. Keep it up.  As you get older, the gym, weights, and $$ for supplements will all come with time, but **the dedication is something you have to achieve on your own**. You did that. ",1992
6dvjjo,I genuinely feel more energetic after a long day of the boring 9-5. What the hell gives? ,"This is because of cortisol, in particular, glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids are a stress hormone and are responsible for giving you energy. So right before you fall asleep, glucocorticoids are at the lowest amount and slowing rise as you sleep. Once you reach a particular level, you usually wake up. At this level, glucocorticoids are at the highest. So if you do nothing all day, glucocorticoids levels drop dramatically but if you get up, do something at least, the drop of glucocorticoids isn't as dramatic.  On another note, people feel like they have more energy throughout the day if they work out in the morning because their glucocorticoid levels are increased during and after your workout. So you feel like you have more energy throughout the day. ",1100
6e2mde,"[Progress pics here](http://imgur.com/a/Hnbz0) M/26/6' I started at around 200 lbs in the first pic, 175 lbs in the second, and 172 in the third. The first and second pictures are roughly 6 months apart, and the last two pictures are about a month and a half apart. In the first picture, I was entirely focused on strength gains and putting up bigger numbers in the bench, squat and deadlift. After ballooning up too much, I decided it was time to lose some weight. **Diet** I decided that I would try a ketogenic style diet for my cut. I say ""style"" because I didn't really care much about being ""in ketosis"" - I quickly discovered that simply by eating fat and avoiding carbs I was much more satiated and able to stay out of the kitchen and snacking throughout the day. I also kept my protein intake at 1g per lb of bodyweight, which according to the keto bible will knock you out of ketosis. The protein intake didn't seem to affect me too greatly. I ate 3 meals per day, and tried my best to stick to the eating hours of 12pm-6pm, though this didn't always happen. As this was a low carb diet, I ate plenty of fatty foods. Breakfast would be something like this: 3 eggs 4 slices of bacon 1 oz cheddar Avocado Lunch: 8 oz ground beef 1 oz cheese Serving of veggies Dinner was similar to lunch. For snacks, I drank protein shakes to fill in my protein requirements and ate quest bars for the fiber and protein as well. Occasionally I would have some full fat Greek yogurt (Fage brand is relatively low in carbs) or whole milk (Fairlife Milk is relatively low in carbs). This all added up to somewhere between 1900-2100 calories daily. **Exercise** During this whole cut I followed [nsuns 531 5-day variation.](http://archive.is/2017.01.27-015129/https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5icyza/2_suns531lp_tdee_calculator_and_other_items_all/) Despite losing weight, I did gain some decent strength in the deadlift and squat using this program, though my bench/OHP didn't increase quite as much. My numbers went from: Squat: 340 lbs > 370 lbs Bench: 230 lbs > 240 lbs Deadlift: 385 lbs > 440 lbs OHP: 145 lbs > 155 lbs For the first 6 months (from first to second pic) I did absolutely no cardio. For the past month and a half, in hopes of losing the final 5 lbs to get to 170, I've been incorporating 3-4 days of steady state cardio for ~20 minute sessions. On off days I will also do some kind of circuit training with light weights. **Conclusions** Overall, I really enjoyed the keto style diet, although I acknowledge the most important factor is achieving a caloric deficit. For my eating preferences, I was able to achieve a sustainable deficit by eating fatty foods and feeling satiated, and that's enough for me. I don't believe keto is ""magical"" or superior to a traditional style diet, but it certainly worked well for me. If you're curious about the diet, check out /r/keto and /r/ketogains - they were great resources for me along the way. TL;DR: Keto style diet + powerlifting style training = better physique Thanks for reading! Edit: I guess it is also important that I mention in the first picture, I had been training consistently for over a year, and I had a decent strength base. **My muscle gains did not all come in the last 7 months**. I don't wish to be misleading.  Edit 2: Apparently the nsuns link isn't working for some so [here's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8EbfzFB0mBrSjBFZ1NUUklHU1E/view) a link to the spreadsheet. Edit 3: Alright since I'm getting a lot of questions, let me give you guys some important info regarding my abs. No, I do not train abs directly, but that does **not** mean that you can necessarily get abs without training them directly. Ever since I was 12 years old, I was obsessed with the idea of a 6 pack, and would do ab exercises almost every day throughout my teen years. I had a horrible physique, but was convinced getting a six pack was the answer - it wasn't. [Even when I was skinny fat, I had some abs under there](http://imgur.com/a/4ZeFM) (this pic is about 4 years old). I don't train abs because I had already developed them as a teen, and heavy compound lifting is enough to maintain them. Going on a huge cut and losing 30 lbs is not going to give you abs if you don't already have them! ",I think I just became homosexual.,820
6fe941,"Decided in late February to get my diet and fitness back in line. Was always a very active guy but some things in my life back in that time period kinda got me off the fitness train. Turns out there was a 90 days body transformation contest starting at the same time I told myself I would start cutting for the summer, so that was a great motivator.  **Diet:**  Everyone knows to lose weight it is pretty simple, you need to burn more than you eat. Simple, not easy. I decided to go pretty strict and to go cold turkey. Now I'll admit at the start I thought I would get to 200lbs and call it a day, the last time I was under that number was back when I was in university, but as I kept going, I kept dropping, feeling good and looking great so I kept at it. Granted when I calculated my TDEE I was a little too conservative in my calculations for my maintenance calorie goal so I ended in a bigger deficit than I originally intended. First month was 2300 calories a day, at least 200g of protein, the rest didn't really care. With the meals I ended going with I was very low carbs, but that worked out fine for me. The first month I had to detox from sugar, mood swings, headaches and the whole nine yards. Month #2, down to 2000 calories a day. At this point I was losing on average 2lbs a week which was great but kinda fast looking back. Still keeping with the 200g of protein a day. I would meal prep on Sundays everything I was allowed to eat for that week. The secret? Friday night was pizza night. I was allowed 4 slices to keep my sanity. I am not a big drinker to start with so cutting alcohol wasn't hard for me and only went with water on diet drinks. Month #3 was the hardest, 2000 calories a day + lots of cardio. Meals stayed the same, I ended up eating the exact same thing for every meal except lunch every single day. I would switch my lunch recipe every week or two to keep things ""fresh"". Month #3 was the hardest, finish line was approaching and I was getting cravings again. Whenever I was really hungry or had massive cravings I would give myself a portion (15g) of the rice chips. The last month I was also drinking probably 4 cans of diet ice tea a day....!  **Workout routine:** Simple PPL, worked out 6 times a week, hit every part twice. Kept my deadlift with my pull day. So I had chest and tris, back and bis, legs and shoulders. Would always hit my main lifts and I would alternate the accessories.  I would also focus on chest on the first push day and tris on the second push day to keep things balanced. My 1RMs at the end of the cut: Squat: 325lbs Deadlift: 325lbs Bench: 225lbs OHP: 135lbs  **Cardio:** Ran 3 times a week outdoors, also played volleyball once a week. With such a high calorie deficit I could only run 5ks, which I would do twice a week + a 2.4k once a week. **Sleep:** Sleep was very crucial. You are putting a lot of stress on your body and it needs extra time to recover when you are in such a high deficit, made sure to drink plenty of water and tried my hardest to get at a minimum 8 hours of sleep per night. **Before and after:** [And here are the pictures, very happy with the results, but now I'll try to not go back to fat and simply maintain!](http://imgur.com/a/EWGS6) Now I'm back on maintenance calories and feel much much better, lost a bit of definition in the abs but I am now seeing progress in the weight room while being in a deficit, I was simply happy with not losing too much strength. **TL:DR**: Don't eat much, lift a lot, run a lot, feel like shit, look awesome!

6fkhhn,"I notice someone else has done the 90-day challenge thing as well and looks insane! Awesome job dude (if you see this) :D ------ Before and after pictures: http://imgur.com/a/8fmJw ------ **Background information:** I work as a web developer. 9 - 5 behind a desk all day though I usually work later so it's more like 9 - 7 and when I get home I'll either be on my laptop again or on the ps4. Basically very unfit and I had never been to the gym before. I used to watch a lot of fitness YouTubers to learn about working out (in the hope one day I'll get enough courage to get into the gym - since I was skinny but had a bit of a belly as well I didn't know what to do and yeah just felt embarrassed). A YouTuber did a 90-day transformation challenge. I took it up. These are my results. ------ **Starting weight:** 153.8lbs **Dumbbell bench press (starting lift):** 12kg (on each arm) for 8 reps. **Bench press (starting lift):** Just the bar with 2.5kg plates on. **Squat (starting lift):** Smith machine bar for 8 reps. **Ending weight:** 149.2lbs **Dumbbell bench press (ending lift):** 30kg (on each arm) for 8reps. **Bench press (ending lift):** The bar with two 25kg plates on (I think it comes to around 70kg total with the bar). **Squat (starting lift):** 40kg Smith machine for 8 reps. ------ My journey consisted of a 60-day bulk and then a 30-day cut. So I'll break these up below. * First 60-days. My maintenance level was around 2400 calories so I bulked for the full 60 days eating around 3000 calories a day. I struggled to hit my target goal everyday (since I wasn't used to eating so much) so I'd have a lot of smoothies that consisted of *peanut butter, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, banana and a mix of yoghurt or water with protein powder*. I did the PPL split I found on this subreddit and followed that religiously without changing anything up. I hit the gym 6 days a week and on the 7th day, I'd just hit whatever wasn't hurting. **My end bulk weight was 158.8lbs** * Last 30-days This is where I had learnt the most from reading through this subreddit, Googling and as a result changed things up a bit. I began my cut. I spent the first few weeks at 1850 calories but I was drinking a lot of Dr Pepper to fill my hunger *(not understanding you count calories in drinks thus I wasn't losing a lot)*. So I cut the drinks out and dropped to 1600 calories a day and began losing weight. I mixed my PPL up. Since my chest was lagging. I'd hit my chest close to three times a week *(if I felt like I could - if not I'd just do another body part)*. I started to superset everything with core work. So I'd do my lifts then immediately go onto some hanging leg raises or something then give myself 30second rest. I did this because of the lack of cardio in my routine and I wanted to cut quicker (I found cutting weight a lot harder than gaining it). So 6 days a week consisting of a PPL while super-setting every set with core work. On the 7th day, I'd do some very light cardio. Walking on a treadmill at a 10% incline at a speed of 5 for 30minutes usually resulted in me burning around 300 calories. **My end cut weight was 149.2lbs** ------ *Things that helped me/I learnt along the way:* * Super-setting everything with core work made my workout a lot more fun and intense. * Next time, leave more time to cut. First time cutting so didn't realise how hard it was to lose weight. * Go every day no matter what and make a routine out of it. Many times I'd get in late from work, around 11 pm. I'd get into the gym for 11:45 pm and leave around 1 am. But I made sure every single day I went to the gym no matter how tired I was the next day. Now, I was on holiday for the past week and all I could think about was the gym lel * Googling a lot, read a lot and ask questions on this subreddit. I learnt so much from doing just that. * Once a week on each body group I'd lift the heaviest I could for 4 reps. I'd up this by the next weight possible each week. Really helped me feel a better sense of accomplishment. * Be nice and genuine to people in the gym. Since I was a noob and all I was always apologetic and polite when asking people stuff in the gym whether it's questions or just asking for a machine. A few times people have just asked do I want to workout with them and they've ended up really pushing my limits which were nice (I usually workout alone). ------ I know it's not the best transformation ever.  But I feel a lot better. My sleep has improved massively. I have more energy. I just all round feel a lot better about myself. **Advice** My single advice would be to go every single day to form a habit. Regardless of what you work on just get in the gym every day and once you're more comfortable in the gym then you can start worrying about what's what. ------ I hope a few people try this 90-day challenge thing. It really is amazing! ------ **EDIT** * I seen someone ask and figured I'd update the post. Here's some pictures of the workout PPL I followed for 60-days. After that I started playing around a bit more with what I did: http://imgur.com/a/cqcbL","Nice work dude.

6grz83,"I’ve been a long time lurker on this sub and have pretty much built my entire exercise life around /r/fitness, thank you so much for everything. Obligatory before and after pictures, nice and early in the post: http://imgur.com/a/kVsiA (scroll to the bottom for most recent pic) **My life:** I’ve been working out for 5 years, but I’ve been traveling around the world and doing freelance consulting for the last 2 years (shout out to /r/digitalnomad). The first 3 years, I consistently went to the gym almost every day. When I started traveling, I knew it was going to be different, but I didn’t realize HOW different. I went/go to the gym whenever convenient, but in many of the places I end up, it’s difficult. I knew things had to change, so I bought some elastic bands I take with me everywhere I go and it’s been awesome. This is a progress update from the last 2 years of traveling and doing a combination of gym + what I like to call *airport* exercises. **May 25th, 2015 > Today (5’9” 21 years old)** **Weight:** 187lbs > 216lbs **Bench (1RM):** 225lbs > 320lbs **Squat (1RM):** 295lbs > 410lbs ________________ I try to work out every single day of the week if possible, but about half the time, that doesn’t mean going to the gym. Some disagree with me when I say it, but sticking to 5X5 is the way to go for me. This post isn’t going to be about 5X5 or the gym, though. I’m going to talk a little bit about how I supplemented NOT having access to a gym. First off, your body is the most amazing set of weights that you have. You can stand up from your seat right now and crank out a bunch of push ups, I’m sure some of you just did. You can further enhance body-weight exercises by getting elastic bands and learning to use them properly. Seriously, if you ever think you are going to be away from your gym and missing a workout, I cannot more highly recommend anything as portable and effective. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been couchsurfing, in airports, hiking, or just in a new city that doesn’t have gyms with day passes. It’s hard to ask in Urdu to use a gym for a few days, especially when you don’t speak Urdu.   [Here are the elastic bands I’ve been using since February](https://www.joshuatreedepot.com/collections/resistance-bands-heavy-duty-latex) (had another set but they wore down, these are my favorites so far). I recommend getting a set instead of a single band because different exercises require different levels of resistance. Also, I quickly progressed and didn’t need some of the lower resistance bands at all any more, I ended up giving the lighter ones away to fitness freaks & geeks I’ve met along the way. [Here is a pdf of band exercises.](https://www.acefitness.org/getfit/rubrbndwkout.pdf) It looks like it is stolen from a middle school health book, but this is actually a really great place for first time/novice elastic band users to start. I followed this pretty closely but tweak my workouts depending on what accessory day I’m on.  Unless I had a crazy night and didn’t sleep a ton, I don’t take breaks in between sets. Each cycle of exercises takes about 10-12 minutes to complete, I can be done in 45-60 minutes which would be roughly the same amount of time I’d spend at the gym, if not less. **Diet:** Fish. So much fish. Cans of fish. Fresh fish. Nigiri. Filets. Sashimi. Every day. Salmon in my eggs, tuna in my sandwich, shrimp in my salads. Unfortunately meal prep is very rarely an option for me, but fish almost always is. I’ve only had red meat once so far this year, and they were the most delicious rocky mountain oysters I’ve ever had. I’ve basically made it a rule to make myself eat seafood with every meal, it’s where I get all of my protein. I know a lot of people can’t afford to do this without eating tuna all of the time, but a nice alternative is to buy some salmon filets from a local butcher and bake/grill/sear those with some Cajun spices + lemon slices. Delicious, fast, sexy, tons of protein. I take creatine, multi-vitamins, fish oil, and caffeine daily. My cut bulk is relatively cyclical, I tend to do slow cuts and fast bulks (2 month cut, 1 month bulk), usually staying roughly 400-800 calories above/below maintenance. I try to eat above 200g of protein daily, I also tend to eat a lot of carbs and don’t have the highest fat diet. I used to use MFP, but have been eyeballing it since I started traveling and occasionally looking up new foods for estimates.  Other important junk: * Sticking to my commitments was the number one thing that helped me above all else. Even with just an elastic band for the majority of my work outs, I was able to achieve results I am extremely happy with. * Sleep. I’ve got a million red eye flights which I used to fill with movie time, now, I force myself to catch as much sleep as possible, even if it means I can’t watch Shawshank Redemption for the 11th time. * Research, Google, watch Youtube videos. Especially when it came to doing work outs on the go, I ended up doing a lot of those corny video classes where there is some jacked lady nicely shout-encouraging you. * Bands are not a replacement for heavy lifting in the gym, but they are a great supplement. You can always size up on the amount of resistance weight. * I really can’t thank /r/fitness enough for all of the amazing content and resources available, you guys are collectively my hero.

6iajmm,"Hey guys! I wanted to re-introduce myself to the sub! My name is Ian and I have posted a couple progress photos in the past but have never really been active on reddit until more recently. A little background about myself and my story: [This](http://imgur.com/a/aMGHj) is a photo of what I looked like at 300lbs and where I was after I cut sugar out of my diet at 195lbs.  [This](http://imgur.com/a/cG0EU) is a year later, June 2017. I still weigh 195lbs but can see the difference in definition and have thinned out. [This](http://imgur.com/a/Cayga) is what I look like without a shirt on now (Sorry my closet is pretty messy ;P) I was always too ashamed to take a picture with my shirt off before so I don’t have one for reference. My problem area has always been my mid section and my body is holding on for dear life.  About ten years ago I hit 300lbs and was at my worst. I bought a gym membership and quickly saw 40lbs drop as I began watching what I ate and started doing more aerobic activity.  Soon after I hit a plateau and fell off the wagon. I struggled up and down for the next eight years going up and down between 240lbs- 260lbs. Mentally I had started to accept that I was just “supposed to be big” for the rest of my life. I had been pretty active throughout that time but I wasn’t seeing results – or the results that I did see would come and go in a blink of an eye. I was 24 years old and about two years into started my career in the entertainment industry. It isn’t a lie – that is an industry where people treat you based on how you look. Not that people would ever put me down or be rude to me but it was obvious that I was overlooked for certain things or people would be short with me. I was on the cusp of my 25th birthday and took a job where I was responsible for dropping off the shows footage to post-production at the end of the night. The problem was I would most likely run into OT so production gave me money to get a meal at the end of the night. So at the end of the night I would drop the footage off and drive-thru somewhere to grab a bite that was paid for (They gave me $7 so it usually ended up being jack in the box – a Large Jumbo Jack meal with a Dr. Pepper to be exact. Two sides of Ranch).   One night in particular I came home – got Jack in the Box, headed to my apartment and started to eat. In the middle of my burger I stopped and realized that I wasn’t even hungry. I was eating the burger routinely and didn’t even think twice about the fact that I didn’t need to eat – I just did because hey, the food was covered by production and why wouldn’t I? It was in that moment that I realized I needed to take things more seriously in my diet. I knew that my weight was an obstacle for me not only personally – but it was actually affecting my long term goals in my career. I was 24, turning 25 and I was unhappy. I thought to myself “My twenties are supposed to be the best time of my life and look at me, I'm miserable.” I know it sounds harsh but I had hit a low point and it was in that moment I decided I needed to make a change. Now – I want to just put it out there that I had always been a bigger kid and never really had a grasp of nutrition and was looking for a way to retrain myself how to eat. I had no sense of moderation because I never had to – it was always a “Large number fill in the blank” or an entire bag of chips. I knew it wouldn’t be easy and I would need help. I asked my roommate to do something for me that I wouldn’t suggest anyone just doing – to be ruthless with me.  Now I want to make it clear that for me – I had to go to the extreme because I didn’t know any other way. I asked her to be on top of me when it came to eating – be harsh. Make a comment if you see me slipping up – point out that I am messing up. This really helped ME a lot (again I don’t suggest this for anyone). I had spent my entire life dealing with people bullying me and my weight and I wanted to use that as motivation and she did it. I told myself the next morning that I would cut out dairy and bread and that is where I would start. The next day on set our Crafty crew had done the unthinkable – they made home made pizza bagels and walked around set offering them up. I had told my coworker that I had given up bread and dairy in hopes to drop weight and he scoffed saying that he would believe it when he saw it. If he hadn’t been there in that moment to tell me that he didn’t think I could do it, I’m not sure I would have turned down that pizza bagel but I knew I couldn’t budge. Time to prove people wrong. I spent the next 3 months without dairy or wheat of any kind and I saw 20lbs drop pretty quickly. That show came and went and it was on to the next, as did my 25th birthday. I had noticed that my sugar intake skyrocketed in the coming months. Sure I had dropped weight but I found myself replacing those things with sugar and soon my body stopped dropping weight and I started gaining again. It was at that time that I had read an article about sugar and the effects it had on your brain. The article noted that coming off sugar was very similar to breaking a meth addiction – I knew I had to see if I could do it. It is interesting how my brain changed in this moment. When people start asking you how you dropped weight and what you did many of them were shocked to learn that cutting dairy and bread helped a lot (I hadn’t really started working out at this point). I knew that I had to try. Cutting sugar out of my diet was one of the toughest things I think I have ever done. It is NOT easy. The first two weeks are by far the most grueling – headache-inducing things I have ever had to do.  Mood swings, depression, anger, HUNGER, cravings, anything you could imagine. 25 years of my body were dependent on sugar and removing that put me through hell and back. After about two weeks of no sugar and feeling like I was ran over by a bus every day I woke up one day and felt…amazing. My head was clear and I had more energy than I had ever had before. I spend about 2 months without sugar, diary, or wheat in my diet and dropped 45 more lbs. In this time I had started working out 4-5 days a week after work. I was exhausted but I knew It was what I needed to do to drop the res of this weight. Eventually I reintroduced sugar, diary, and wheat into my diet within moderation. One thing that hasn’t changed is my ability to eat. I try and keep these things out of my diet because I tend to binge on them now. I was 260lbs when I decided to give up dairy and sugar and today I weigh 195lbs. In total I am down 105lbs and never have felt better in my life. But it isn’t over and it never will be. I still binge eat, I still crave, but I have learned to tell myself no or stop myself from over eating.  Now my workout consists usually of running 3-6 miles, 3 if I am circuit training, 6 if I am not. I follow that up with swimming 400-700 meters depending on whether or not I circuit train.

6ip5is,"https://ibb.co/h8gFiQ so quick backstory: former fat kid, got really into exercise early teens and basically developed some kind of eating disorder. I was eating way too clean, eating way too little and exercising way too much. I was basically trying to maintain 4% BF for like...a decade. needless to say, not a good thing. I was depressed, foggy headed, lethargic and unfocused all the time. a little over a year ago I got sick and I'll spare you the details but had a year from hell. Needed a bunch of surgeries, which led to me not being able to work out, and eat less. I dropped to about 140 pounds. I came out the other end of all this medical shit feeling like I had a second chance. That sounds corny as hell but its the best way to put it. I started eating way more, eating way smarter and exercising like a real person. (I spent years just fucking around at the gym, avoiding deadlifts and squats, doing too much cardio; led to a really lean frame, but under developed.) Anyways I am now 170 pounds 5'11. I am still bulking, and hoping to get to about 185-190 before cutting back down to a lean 175. Before and after pictures are about 14 months apart. Keep in mind that before picture was at like the worst, right after 3 surgeries; not pretty. Diet is not going to be anything you haven't heard before, I stick to mainly whole foods, lots of oats, sweet potatos and rice. Lots of chicken and lots of vegan protein powder (I love whey but cannot tolerate it.) I recently got some food allergy testing done and found I am ""sensitive"" to dairy and gluten and eggs (!!). While I don't necessarily plan on eating that way forever, I am currently dairy free, gluten free, egg free (kinda fucking sucks).....I want to see how I feel in a couple months and reintroduce foods from there. I am still able to hit my macros, just takes a bit more preparation (no more protein bars, lots of vegan protein powder and real foods: tuna, chicken, potatoes etc) However the majority of my bulking was done while eating all those goodies; lots of greek yogurt, eggs, some cheese, lots of nut butters, tons of vegetables, whole wheat bread, wraps, granola etc.  I also quit drinking. Or at least am stopping for a long time. I never drank a huge amount, but its all subjective, I definitely had at least one drink every day. I always thought it would be the ""last thing to go"" but it was okay after a couple days. Its been since January 1st. Definitely notice a difference, feel a million times better, sleep better, no anxiety etc etc.. I'm also off caffeine which kind of sucks too. I just wanted to quit all my vices, see how I feel, then decide which ones I may want to re-introduce.  I follow a IIFYM style of eating but don't really go overboard. The last meal of everyday is usually some ""healthy"" style of dessert, typically a protein ice cream (protein powder, ice, nut milk in the vitamix, then depending on my remaining macros for the day, i will top that with granola, trail mix, chocolate chips, dates etc etc) this daily ""treat"" keeps me very satisfied.  I started on a PHUL program, before transitioning to 5/3/1 and I am currently on my 4th week of nSuns which i think is my favourite so far. It offers tons pf variety and I enjoy the volume. lifts are: squat 270 bench 210 deadlift 350 ohp 140 unfortunately I don't know my ""before"" #'s since I didn't really track them (fuckarounditis) I track everything now like a god damned maniac though. Makes all the difference in the world. My current macros are 2800 calories 62 fat 175 protein 385 carbs I weigh myself everyday to get a weekly average and make sure to gain around 1.5 pounds a week, I typically change my macros slightly every couple weeks depending on the scale #'s I think thats it? Any questions, fire away. Thanks to all you guys, this place is an incredible wealth of information.  EDIT: thanks for all the incredible feedback folks. you guys are truly the best. humbled by all the kind words and more than happy to continue to provide any information I can to anyone in need. sidebar: some people were upset with my use of ""bitch smacking"" in the title. i get it, no offence intended. the phrase doesn't pop up in my vernacular, but for some reason i decided to use it while titling this post, go figure. clearly no disrespect, i was talking about the disorder. that shit is a real bitch.",R u single ,298
6ksxsk,"https://www.transcripts.io/transcripts/tim_ferriss_show/2017/05/04/rhonda-patrick.html Rhonda Patrick discusses her exercise regime: ""In addition to squat jumps and running, I also lift some weights and do lunges and squats with weights either two to three times per week. It is really important to maintain muscle mass. Starting in middle age, people lose between .5 to one percent muscle mass per year. One study involving over 300 twins speaks to the importance of legs in particular. Greater strength and power in the legs, in particular, was associated with an increased brain volume 10 years later and less brain aging in over 300 twins. Other fitness measures, besides that of legs, such as forced expiratory volume or grip strength, were not associated with brain aging when leg power was excluded. Other lifestyle and health measures, such as frailty telomere length also indicated that reverse causation was not likely. To get right down to it, don’t skip leg day.""",This seems like a grossly unjustified leap from correlation to causation. ,1030

I’ve been lurking r/fitness off and on since before the first day ever stepping foot inside a gym, and I thought maybe my story could be interesting to a few of you. I notice we get a lot of posts about people who were playing video games all day and ended up quitting that to pursue a healthy gym life. Totally cool - but my story is a little different. I actually got MORE dedicated to my love of video games during my fitness/life transformation, so I want to give hope to people who think it’s an either/or decision!    At the time of writing this I’m the 3rd ranked achievement hunter in the world on PC (Steam - over 117,000 achievements earned, over 840 games 100% complete) and have had a wide variety of success including a few dozen Guinness World Record book appearances, Xbox/Playstation world championship victories, getting my own official video game trading card, and various other nerd stuff like getting some articles written about me for a 43-hours-straight marathon session (which resulted in a world first for Borderlands 2). Since this is an r/fitness post I don’t want to dwell on the non-fitness parts of it, but totally willing to talk more about it in the comments if you guys are interested. I think it is an important part of my story to make clear though: **I got WAY better and more accomplished at video games after starting my fitness journey!** In fact I gave a talk at one of the big gaming conventions (PAX) about how I feel gamers are super-charged potential ready to be unleashed on fitness success. One of my main goals is to show other people like me that they have this power inside.   Anyways, I grew up very small and skinnyfat, reaching a peak of 130 lbs as an adult after being in the low 100-something lbs range through high school. Somehow not that lean of a 100-130 because I grew up never playing a single sport or...going outside, and instead spent my developmental years glued to Runescape, World of Warcraft, Halo, etc.  Before lifting:  http://i.imgur.com/zn6SW3z.png   So many people told me I had to quit playing video games all the time and start going to the gym, and I gave a big “hell no” to that. It wasn’t until my third year of college that my formerly-overweight best friend tried lifting weights and convinced me to give it a shot. He basically said “dude check out r/fitness and try Starting Strength” and I was on my way. This was mid-2011.   First day in the gym was a confusing nightmare. I was googling “what does a barbell look like” and similar questions from my phone, desperately trying to figure out what was going on. I still have a picture of a squat rack from the very first time in the gym, which I sent to someone to ask what it was. My starting lifts were basically 45 lbs or slightly more. I will forever remember failing 45x1 on overhead press and having to try some lighter dumbbells to get the motion down. Needless to say, I was very weak and had a long road ahead. I ended up alternating between a day with squat/overhead press/deadlift and a day with squat/bench press/assisted pullups, sometimes throwing in a few curls or something. Basic minimalist linear progression with barbells (3x/week). I had help and motivation from a few cool internet people like u/MythicalStrength and was on my way!   This is my first “after” picture, the strongest and most fit I’ve ever been in my life (yikes): http://i.imgur.com/2ELD36a.jpg   Eventually I started getting pretty burned out and realizing that I needed to do something more fun, I started doing 5/3/1 which introduced the startling concept of...doing more than 5 reps of an exercise. Needless to say the adjustment was brutal, haha, and it was definitely the right move. AMRAP sets were a huge motivator for me, and I made an excel spreadsheet with a full list of all my best reps at each weight, best sets of 5x10, etc. After that, I rotated through a few powerlifting-specific programs and worked my numbers up to a 200-something bench, 300-something squat, and just over 400 deadlift...then totally lost motivation at the beginning of 2013. Didn’t really make any progress that year. Here’s me in 2014 getting ready to set goals again:   http://i.imgur.com/8PkgqHE.png   As you can see I’ve put on a TON of mass from where I started...but a lot of it still not good, haha. I stuck to barbells as a foundation again with almost the exact same program I started with in 2011, then switched to the PHAT template and learned a ton of new exercises. For the first time, building toward looks as a primary goal seemed like a cool thing to do, rather than obsessing over the barbell numbers as my only metric for success. My motivation was very off and on, and the big long term goal and my discipline toward it was the only thing that kept me on track most of the time. Eventually I switched over to some basic push/pull/legs action and modified that completely by feel. Sometimes I’d do sets of 30-50, sometimes I’d do a bunch of sets of 4, and so on. But usually I’ll gravitate, these days, to sets of 8-12 for my main work, maybe 15’s or 20’s for certain stuff.   Here’s me now after all that, sitting right at 200 lbs.   http://i.imgur.com/7qcw3Z7.jpg http://i.imgur.com/zIJ7ci1.jpg http://i.imgur.com/vdWGHyo.jpg   Example template for the workouts. Exercises would be worked on with increasing weight or reps each time until I don’t feel like the following session would be productive to attempt this (loss of rep quality, or just running myself too hard into a wall) and then rotated out for another variation. Another strategy I may use is to REDUCE the weight of an exercise every single week, but increase the sets and reps. Nothing groundbreaking, but I spent so long desperately trying to increase the weight every single time that it took me a while to realize all these other options, haha   Here’s a recent example of how my 3 days on / 1 day off rotation looks:   Push: Barbell incline up to a heavy set of 10, then lighter 4x10 Dumbbell ohp 5x10 Rope pushdowns 3x12 Overhead rope extensions 3x12 Side raises 3x15 Dips 3xFailure Pull: Deadlift 3x5 Tbar rows 3x10 Seated rows 3x15 Rear flyes 3x12 Face pulls 3x15 Lat pulldowns 3x15 Preacher curls 3x20 Legs: Squat 4x6 Leg press 3x20 Leg extension 4x12 Leg curls 4x15 Calf raises 3x18 Dumbbell curls 3x12 (<-Yes I know this isn't legs, but it's a major weakpoint, haha)     Biggest struggles / mistakes / lessons:   1. CONSISTENCY - Lots of on/off cycles of going super hard, then not at all. In 2017, I feel like I finally for the first time in my life locked into a firm unwavering dedication to a fitness-based future and am feeling accepting about the ups and downs in the process. Understanding that not every week or month will have 100% dedication is a huge part of fitness for me, because beating myself up too much about it will surely lead to crashing and burning. 2. BALANCE - Not like, balancing on a tightrope, but I mean balancing the effort you put into your workouts. I’ve had bad habits of dumping 90% of my energy in the first exercise or two and then neglecting the rest, and then years later tried to correct it by putting way too little effort into my exercises in fear of not finishing the workout strong with good reps. Of course, I then figured out that the answer is somewhere in between. Hit your “main” movements hard, but with a smart plan, and then attack your assistance movements with sufficient ferocity as well! They matter a lot more than I realized. 3. NUTRITION - I’ve struggled a lot with eating properly throughout my life and I neglected it for a very long time. For most of my time lifting, I was basically cramming myself with whatever easy fast food I could find, just desperately fixated on putting in more calories and gaining more muscle and adding more strength. I even did ""gallon of milk per day"" for a month early on, haha. I started to find pretty good success with the IIFYM style, eating a lot of “unhealthy foods” but at least “intelligently chosen junk”, for lack of a better phrase haha. But my results were very slow, and very strength-based (eat whatever I need to get my squat to go up, even if I gain some fat) so as my goals shift, my nutrition has shifted to roughly the following for now, and obviously adjustments are made up/down depending on goal and results:   7am: Eggs, sliced turkey, toast, packet of flavored oatmeal 10am: Cereal, whey shake (usually I DON’T use protein powder, but started to now preworkout like this) 11am: Start sipping on a 50g carb shake (lots of brand options, go with taste preference haha) 1pm: Some kind of meat (maybe chicken or tilapia), rice, some cashews, some veggies 6pm: Some kind of meat (maybe salmon or steak), potatoes, and a small salad 8pm: Greek yogurt and nuts   Quantities are adjusted up and down but right now that’ll put me around 220g pro / 320g carb / 85g fat. This is the most protein and least fat I’ve ever had in my life, for what it’s worth! I’m liking it.   Current goals: Making fat loss a focus while trying to slowly improve strength, then add some mass to these arms and back! Kind of vague, I know - but my main goals end up being simple stuff like “I want to do all these reps again, but 5 lbs more on the bar next time.” Keeps me focused!   Phew, well I think that covers the main details so far! Please don’t hesitate to ask if you’re curious about any more details or info - this is the first time writing a transformation post haha! And I’d like to say thanks to you all, to r/fitness but just to everyone who has that calling to ask questions and share answers with each other with the purpose of us all collectively growing. Without internet communities like this one, I know 100% that I never would have gotten myself into the life I live now. Fitness in 2017 is such a beautiful and accessible thing because of communities like this one. It really has changed my life to something completely unrecognizable, in all the best ways. edit: Oh god I'm ""that guy"" making the typical edit - I love you all so much and I'm so overwhelmed and thankful for these comments.

6ltftt,"# Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6y0D_8kRoU Hey athletes of /r/fitness, i filmed my favorite finger/wrist sequence that's especially good for you after you have spent a day at the computer or playing with a gamepad. I consists 4 short exercises and 1 stretch and you can easily do it in the sitting position after your work. It will promote bloodflow into your forearm muscles, your finger tendons, stretch your finger flexors and make you feel good. It takes only five minutes of your time and you can just follow-along with the video, if you like. If you don't like to watch **[the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6y0D_8kRoU)**, i have the exercises written down with pictures for you here: * After a long day at the computer, start by shaking your hands a little bit. It will loosen up the tightness in the fingers and make them feel good. * [Start by closing and opening your hands in an explosive fashion.](http://imgur.com/ciUsayl) Focus on really closing the fist with your muscles and opening them quickly. Do this for about 30 seconds. * Second Exercise: Now keep the fingers tight to each other and close the hand in two steps: [With straight, extended fingers, bend at the MCP joint, then bend the PIP joint next.](http://imgur.com/CNl0qWB) Now open your hand explosively and repeat. Do this for about 30 seconds. * [Next exercise is closing and opening your fingers at the DIP joint (which is the last joint before the fingertips).](http://imgur.com/4vK9BP5) * Shake your hands again for a bit, like at the start of the routine. * Next exercise are the ""Walking Extensors"". Take the ending position from the Second Exercise and extend the Index Finger. Now while closing the index finger, extend the middle finger. Close the middle finger and extend ring and pinky finger. Go back to the middle finger. And back to the index finger. Repeat for about 30 seconds! [Example picture here.](http://imgur.com/eFgvqcb) If you can, go really fast at this one and increase the speed. * End the routine with a flexor stretch of your fingers. [Extend them, grab them with the other hand and stretch.](http://imgur.com/GN967VP) Done! Go for 30 seconds per side. I hope you enjoy this routine. To promote discussion i would like to ask you guys a few questions aswell: * After a long day at the computer, do you stretch your fingers or do a sequence like the one above? * Do you think it's necessary at all to warm up/work out the fingers before/after sitting for a long time? **Edit: [Someone X-Posted it to /r/videos for me!

6mvakz,"Hey all of you. TL;DR Was fat, am not anymore.  https://i.imgur.com/rBVgYk9.jpg Just wanted to talk to you a bit about my transformation in the last 2 years. It was a hell of a rollercoaster. In May 2015, I had enough. I was feeling sick, I was 24 and supposed to be in my prime. But at 340 pounds and 5’11’’, it was not the case. So I decided to change. I went on the subreddit r/loseit and learned how to lose weight by counting your calories. And it worked. In the first week I lost 17 pounds. Sure, a lot of it was water but God did it give me motivation to continue. The second week, I was 10 pounds lighter. It really worked.  So I counted my calories until I was around 215 pounds. By then, I had lost 125 pounds in around 7 months. While I was doing this, I decided to do the C25K (r/C25K) to help me start running. I ran my first 5K while I was weighing 275 pounds. It was slow, so very slow, but I did it. I was SO proud of myself. I was working on becoming a healthier person. That’s when I saw one of my childhood friend who is a gym rat. He was so proud of me and asked me if I was going to the gym. I was, but I did not follow any program. I was still doing some “FuckArountIt”, meaning I didn’t know what I was doing. So he helped me to do a basic program. 3 Days Split PPL LEGS Cardio 20 minutes Squat 4 x 8 Lying Leg Curl 4 x 8 Stiff-Legged Deadlift 4x8 Russian Step-up 4x8 One Leg Squat 4x8 Calf Raise 4x8 Cardio 20 minutes PUSH Cardio 20 minutes Flat Bench 4x6 Seated Cable Row 4x8 Lat Pulldown 4x8 Incline Dumbell Bench Press 4x8 Dumbell Row 4x8 Flat Fly 4x8 Cardio 20 minutes PULL Cardio 20 minutes Deadlift 5x6 OHP 5x8 Shrug 4x8 Barbell Row 4x10 Glute-Ham raise 4x8 Cardio 20 minutes  With this new program in the gym, I then started to follow something like LeanGains (r/leangains) in counting my macros. Training days 1800 Calories High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat. Rest Day 1500 Calories High Protein, Low Carbs High Fat.  And I continued to shed some fat. It was slower, of course but progress kept on going. I stopped after 11 months at 172 pounds lost. I was weighing 168 pounds and was pretty skinny.  https://i.imgur.com/c4BEQyK.jpg  At this point, I started going to maintenance a bit, around 2200/2400 calories. It was summer so I went in vacation, had fun and enjoyed my new shape. I even did a 21k for fun with a friend.  So, here we are. 168 pounds, able to run 21k, going to the gym 3 to 4 time a week. Eating 2200 calories a day. What was I going to do now?  It’s Bulk time. To do this, I changed my 3 day Split PPL a bit. LEG Cardio 20 minutes Squat 5 x 10 Lying Leg Curl Machine 5x8 Leg Extension 5x8 Leg Press 5x10 Calf Raise 4x8 Stiff-Legged Deadlift 5x10 Shrug 5x20 PUSH Cardio 20 minutes Flat Bench 5x8 Dumbbell Row 5x8 Seated Cable Row 5x10 Incline Bench 4x8 Flat Fly 4x10 Push-up AMRAP Lateral Dumbbell raise 4x8 Front Dumbbell raise 4x8 Shrug 5x20 PULL Cardio 20 minutes OHP 4x10 Chin up 4x5 Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension 3x8 Seated Cable Row 3x10 Parallel Bar triceps Dip 3x10 Barbell Curl 3x10 Triceps Pulldown 3x10 Shrugs 4x20 Lat Pulldown 4x8  As for my macros, it looked like this: Training Days 2900 Calories, High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat Rest Days 2100 Calories, High Protein, Low Carbs, High Fat I bulked from October 2016 to March 2017 and put on around 20 pounds.  https://i.imgur.com/2HYDCcJ.jpg  So in March, I started a cut to shed a bit of the fat that I got while doing this lean bulk. I finished it in June at around 175lbs. I was doing the same program. Just added some cardio 3 days (10k). As for the macros:  Training Days 2100 Calories, High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat Rest Days 1700 Calories, High Protein, Low Carbs, High Fat  https://i.imgur.com/Zh6lK9K.jpg  Since then, I’ve switched to nsuns 5days program and upped my calories to go into maintenance/recomp. I’m still getting leaner so I guess everything is going great. ","How come every time I see one of these fat to fit things the guy is always good looking as fuck.

We try to get a minimum of 200 grams of protein a day (as opposed to 140 like last time). Even though people recommend 0.5-1g of protein per pound of bodyweight, we feel like our progress has significantly improved by sticking to the 200 grams of protein, ESPECIALLY during our cut.  During cuts, we eat at around 2200, which was 2 lbs a week deficit (during the summer, we walk A LOT as we have no car, and the gym is 3.5 miles one way. During the school-year, our TDEEs are closer to 2900-3000). We're doing our first bulk in a long time, and our first long bulk. Right now we're eating 3500-3700 everyday and it seems to be going well.  --- Competing: We competed in our first powerlifting meet on July 8th.

Justin got 2nd place in teens and 7th overall, and [beat the teen Georgia State Deadlift Record with a 227.5 kg deadlift]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKyidZ0bh-I&feature=youtu.be). Not going to clog this post with this but go to [this link if you want to read more about it (and feel free to comment on it as well!)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/6mawin/meet_report_5_bar_showdown_525_kg_681_kg_404/) --- Thought to end this post with 5 points that we wish we knew before we started lifting 1.	Get on a program! We just did random 5x5 workouts at first and while we made some amazing progress, getting on nsuns made everything SKYROCKET. Our modifications was after running it for a bit to fit our preferences, but the bottom line is that if you’ve never lifted before, follow something from someone who knows what they are doing will be your best bet 2.	PROTEIN! We had to cut at a significant rate for our powerlifting competition (2-2.5lbs a week). We went from 163lbs to 150lbs  and 154lbs to 143 (including water cut) in a month Our bench digressed by 5 lbs but our other lifts both improved by at least 10 lbs. We STRONGLY attribute that to keeping our intensity as high as we could manage while mitigating the risk for injury as well as having a LOT of protein (200 grams eating <2000 calories)  3.	Don’t assume a cut means you’ll lose strength. Sorta add on to the previous point but we were terrified that we would lose strength for our competition but as we previous stated, most of our lifts went up during our drastic deficit and water cut 4.	Count your calories! We mentioned this during our last post but we think counting your calories is absolutely vital for success. Unless you’re eating the same meal-prepped foods every day, knowing what you put in your body is invaluable  5.	Consistency. It won’t happen overnight. Some days you’ll be bloated and look terrible. Some days you look great. Some days you just don’t want to go to the gym. Honestly, just push through it. Making going to the gym a habit (or whatever your chosen physical activity) will make the whole process smoother Edit: Becuase we have a lot of skepticism, yes we are completely natural. The biggest proof we have is when [we were drug tested for our powerlifting competition](http://i.imgur.com/YePwfu2.jpg). We have never and don't plan to ever hop on steroids.

6re9k5,"**Before/After:** http://imgur.com/334OHx8 This is from July 23 2016 to ~ July 29 2017  **26M** **Height:**5'9 **Before Picture Weight:** 196 Pounds (yes, really.  My legs can hold some serious weight bro) **After Picture Weight:** Currently sitting at 164 pounds.  --------------------------------------------- **Lifts** Disclaimer: I didn't log weights until I started taking PPL seriously, so the starting weight may not be exact, but I'm confident that this is *pretty* close. I had never lifted a weight before starting out, so my lifts were overall very weak to start with. **Bench (5X5):** 40lbs - 180lbs **Squat (3X5):** 95lbs - 200lbs  **Overhead Press (5X5):** 30lbs(I think?) - 120lbs **Deadlift (1X5):** 135lbs - 275lbs **Rows (5X5):** 50lbs - 160lbs I actually did 5X5 for squats for a while, because I wasn't paying attention and didn't realize it was supposed to be 3X5 at first.  Once I started over on my squats I did the proper 3X5 and it's been climbing since then. Some might call into question why my squat and deadlift are so low.  Well, because I didn't do that shit for way too long.   With squats in particular, I got some nasty tendentious in my hip, and had to build back up to my 200 squat slowly from 120 again.  I finally climbed back up to 200 this past week, and my hip feels just fine.  200 is also feeling pretty easy right now, so I'm confident that it will rise to a more ""normal"" squat for my size easily.  For deadlifts, I was afraid I'd snap my back in half originally, and just felt like I could skip them (I'd slap ""past me"" if I could).  I'm still heavily focused on form, and tend to drop the weight once my back shows any sign of curling.  I'm deadlifting 275 currently, but can probably do a bit more once I lock down my form. --------------------------------------------------------- **Program: October 2016 - Jaunary 2017** From October 2016 until January I fucked around with a half-assed brosplit.  I was cutting heavily at the time (~1.5 pounds a week on average). Lifting was *entirely* new to me, so I learned from a coworker at the time, who praised his bro-split routine, and I fully embraced it.  I worked 3 days a week, meandering around the gym and just sort of picking heavy shit up. **Program: January 2017 - March 2017** This is when I came across metallicadpa's ppl routine on this subreddit.  I decided to do a half-assed version of it with dumb bells and continued to kinda fuck around with *mostly* working out 6 days a week.  I didn't do deadlifts or squats, because I wasn't confident in deadlifts and felt like leg press was a substitute for squats.  Yeah, I know. I followed the rest of the program's lifts, but wasn't doing the program.  I substituted barbell exercises with dumb bells, because I was more comfortable that way, and I wasn't keeping track of my lifts at all.  Pro Tip: don't do that. Towards the end here, I started dead-lifting.  I started with 135 pounds, and genuinely couldn't go up in weight.  My lower back and hamstrings were way too weak.   **Program: March 2017 - Current** I decided to get my shit together and ACTUALLY do the PPL routine.  I got myself a little book, logged my weights, and progressed with barbell exercises like I should.  I followed, and still follow the program to a tee now.  Within two weeks I felt a huge difference in strength. This is also when I started my first bulk.  I cut 38 pounds of fat, and could have gone a little further, but I was pretty excited to start my first bulk.  I bulked from March until early July and went from 158lbs - 169lbs.  I originally planned to bulk until October, and then cut for Summer of 2018, but I got a girlfriend - and she foiled my plans.  I'm currently cutting some body fat for a month or two before I begin lean bulking through Fall and Winter. ------------------------------------------------------------- **Diet** At first I wanted to blame my metabolism for my initial weight gain (in reality it was from getting my first desk job and not changing the way I ate).  I learned through this subreddit and the wiki - rather quickly - that I was being a damned fool.   I initially cut my calories by limiting my meals to sandwiches and frozen burritos every day.  That's literally all I ate for 3 months.  I initially justified this because it was dirt cheap and effective for weight loss.  I didn't take into account that:  1. Eating a nutritionally void diet makes you feel pretty awful  2. You can get nutrition for cheap 3. You can eat more food if you eat less calorie dense foods (go figure) After 3 months of my awful diet, I switched over to a strict meal plan that I still generally follow to this day.  I eat:  * Protein Shake (whey, whole milk and peanut butter - tastes great with coffee concentrate if you have it) * Chicken, Broccoli, Rice * Beef and Eggs * And if I'm feeling crazy, sometimes avocado and/or cottage cheese And that's about it.  I eat the same thing just about every single day, and I enjoy it.  The lack of variety doesn't bother me, though I still eat other things on the weekends to enjoy my food a bit more with my friends and family.   The main reason for my ridiculously cheap meal plan is that I'm one frugal mother-fucker, and this keeps my grocery bill about as cheap for complete nutrition as you can get.   This diet doesn't include fish, so I supplement with fish oil.  I take animal (that's the brand - not talking about animal shaped gummies, here lol) multivitamins as well, just to ensure that I'm not missing out on any minerals or vitamins.   ---------------------------------------------------- **Further Ramblings** I actually posted my progress on here before: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5u1icy/my_5_month_transformation_progress/ You'll notice I get called out for my lifts seeming a bit odd when people asked for them.  That's because I wasn't logging anything and just kinda guessed where I thought things were at.  It helped me realize I still wasn't doing things optimally, and I'm sure I still have a lot to learn. > How do you prepare your food? For the shake, I blend up the ingredients in a shake bottle with a lid attachment - so similar to a bullet.  Takes me less than a couple minutes to whip up, chug, and clean.  Laziest breakfast ever. For the chicken and broccoli, I throw that shit in the oven and watch netflix for 20 minutes, take out the broccoli, and then take out the chicken after 45 minutes.   I make a shit ton of rice every week or so in roughly 10 minutes, and then everything goes in the fridge/freezer.  I toss my lunch foods into meal prep containers, and then I'm done. > How is this 1 year of progress if you started lifting in October? I started dieting in July last year, and went to the gym a few times, but I didn't really try and take lifting seriously until October.   > how much food do you eat? That changes depending on my current goal.  I'm currently eating around 1800-2000 calories a day on a cut, and while bulking I was eating around 2400-2600 calories a day. > How about seasoning? Some ""kickin' chicken"" seasoning from walmart + copious amounts of hot sauce for the chicken, and then I cover my broccoli with steak seasoning (sounds weird but it's tasty as fuck).   For the beef and eggs, I just use salt, pepper, and you guessed it - more hot sauce. > Your previous post didn't have rice in the meal plan I actually didn't add the rice until I started my bulk, and so I was effectively on a keto diet.  Adding rice made a massive difference in my overall energy.  I'll never go back to low carb.  I didn't realize how much energy I was missing out on until I re-introduced them. > What are your long term fitness goals? This goal shifts a lot.  At first, I just didn't want to be fat.  Now, I wanna look as good as I can with my clothes off.  I think I'm going to want to improve my cardiovascular fitness as well, because I currently don't do any cardio whatsoever.   Once my linear progression stalls (my squat  and bench are still steadily climbing) I'll probably switch to 5/3/1 > Why don't you do cardio? Don't feel like it.  > It's good for you I know.  I'll step up my cardio game at some point. > How about creatine? I add creatine to my shake every morning > Preworkout? Once in a blue moon I'll take it if I'm feeling fog-headed and don't have work the next day, but generally I don't feel like I need it.  Warmups are usually enough to get my ready to lift at my best. > What do you do for warmups? I usually just do 5-10 reps with really low weight to get the blood moving.  If that doesn't get me going, I'll add a little weight before tackling my big lift.   > What about your progress on your legs and back? I sadly never took progress photos of either, but I can take a shot of my back and legs and add it to the album, if people are curious. > Why are your starting lifts so low?  Were you *really* that weak? No, probably not, but these were the numbers I started with.  Keep in mind, I was completely new and learning proper form from scratch here while trying to move up in weight/reps every day, so these weights seemed to work for me at the time. ------------------------------------------------------- **TL;DR** I read the wiki and good things happened.  Looking forward to year 2. **Edits for clarity and such","Not bad. Everything looks in proportion, although your OHP is pretty strong and squat is a bit weakish.

6rysq3,"The job is pretty physically demanding. Lots of walking, squatting, bending and lifting. The packages are anywhere from 1 pound to 100 pounds (45 kilograms), and I pick up anywhere from 300-600 packages per day. I'm also in Las Vegas, Nevada, so every day is 100+ degrees (37 celsius). I guess I'm just looking for tips on how to not be so sore every morning, or how to retain enough energy to make it through the first week. I should be fine after a week. I'm 300 pounds, and I was an over-the-road truck driver for the last 4 years, and during this time I put on 80 pounds, so I'm pretty out of shape. But I'm 29 years-old, and was an athlete in high school and played recreational sports until I was 23 or 24, and I'm confident that after week 1, I'll be fine. I actually started the job on Friday, and also worked yesterday, but have today and tomorrow off to recover. I'm not as sore as I thought I was going to be. My quads and hamstrings are a little sore, but not on fire like they are after I work out. Arms are fine, slight soreness in my biceps and forearms, but that was expected. The right side of my lower back is a little sore, and I don't think it's a muscle, as I've had a pain like this before, and it just takes a few days to subside, and I'll emphasize proper lifting technique from here on out.  I have pain in my right foot. If someone told you to stand on your toes, it'd be the bone/s at the base of your toes, that all your weight would be on. I broke my metatarsal about 10 years ago on the same foot, and the doctor just had me let scar tissue heal it, but the pain isn't coming from where the break occurred, but it's right next to it. No idea if it's related. I get a pain in my abdomen at times. Sometimes when I lean over to one side, I get a pain in that side, and it subsides after 15-30 seconds. Not sure what that's about. My diet the last two nights after work has been a big plate of spaghetti, with tomato sauce and beef, and a gallon of water. I bring 2 gallons of water to work, so there are no dehydration concerns. I've been stretching every muscle group before work. I should probably stretch after work as well, right? Didn't think about it until just now. Any tips would certainly be appreciated. If I had to work today, I'd be in some trouble. I may not be incredibly sore, but I'm exhausted. edit 11:30 PST: I did not anticipate this thread getting this much attention. In a perfect world, I would be able to respond to every comment, but I just don't have the time, so please don't be offended if I don't. edit: 12:30 PST: You are awesome. All of you. I now have a wealth of information to go grocery shopping with tomorrow morning. This is a job that I'm going to be sticking with until after, at least, the ""peak"" season, which is Christmas/New Year, and many people have suggested I document my, undoubted, weight-loss, and I will not disappoint.  edit: 6 p.m. PST: It's my fault for not mentioning it, but I've already taken steps to manage ""chub-rub"". edit: 10:50 p.m. PST: This is not a ""weight-loss"" thread.

6xo5yj,"Hey all, My GF said to me the other day that she thinks I should stop counting calories and my macros and just eat what I want. She thinks I've become obsessed with it, when In fact it's just routine. She said that if I carry on, then the day where I can't track my calories it will lead to depression. To prove a point I didn't track at all yesterday and it didn't feel any different. When we eat out or when I'm around her I loosely track them and guesstimate, I don't carry a scale around with me everywhere. When I'm at home however i do track precisely. What are your thoughts on this? Should I continue to track them anyway? Cheers  Edit:  Holy shit, I didn't expect this many responses. Thank you all so much!  To clarify, I've never been depressed before and I'm not an obsessive person. I don't get addicted to things very easily.  Edit #2: When we eat out, it's not like I sit there before we go out and scrutinise the menu for nutrition info, I'll get whatever I like then log it after and make the adjustments for the rest of the day to fit my macros. Edit #3: I would reply to you all individually but I think I answered the main questions in the first two edits, and it's super late for me now, if I get time tomorrow I'll do it. Thank you all so much again! Edit #4: NO my GF is not fat. She goes the gym, but doesn't track food intake.","The idea of weighing and measuring and tracking food seems over the top to the uninitiated. I've had people make jokes, call me obsessive, and poke fun at me for doing it. But at the end of the day... who's in great shape, and who isn't? Anything worth doing is worth doing well. I think as long as what you're doing isn't interfering with the rest of your life, what's the harm?  I'd only consider it ""obsessive"" if it's getting to the point where you're losing sight of the big picture, like if a friend offers you a single sip of wine or something and you're spending the next five minutes doing Google searches on your phone looking for macro info instead of paying attention to your GF or your friends. If you want to get granular with cheat meals just take a picture of the food and figure it out later, alone. Don't let macro tracking interfere with your social life. But in general there's nothing wrong with tracking per se -- it's important information and helps inform you what to adjust when you need to re-align yourself with your goals. ",1441

No meat otherwise, and no dairy (except for the rare ice cream treat; a pint can last months in my freezer). I've been doing 16:8 intermittent fasting for many years now, and am thoroughly loving it (it's not for everyone, so always check with a medical professional before you make any significant changes to your lifestyle). **Supplements:** None, except for daily calcium & Omega 3 pills. **Sleep:** 6 hours a day, plus post-work naps as needed. **Misc:** Never drank, smoked, or used drugs. Don't like coffee/tea. I do enjoy the occasional smoothie, but otherwise primarily drink water. **Workout routine:** * Monday/Wednesday/Friday - 50 min cardio (10K run on elliptical using HIIT program, getting my peak heart rate into the 170s) * Tuesday - arms/back/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)         Arms:         * barbell curl         * one arm cable curls         * reverse curl         * chin-ups         Back:         * lat pulldown         * back extension machine         * pull ups         * vertical row         Abs:         * hanging leg raises         * ab crunches         * decline crunches * Thursday - legs/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)         Legs:         * quad extension         * hamstring curls         * leg press machine         * calf machines (standing & seated) * Saturday - chest/triceps/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)         Chest:         * flat bench press         * incline bench press         * decline bench press         * chest fly machine         * dips         Notes: I don't use heavy weights in my bench presses since I'm not a powerlifter and I don't have a workout partner to spot me, so I've incorporated more exercises to compensate.

Im going to be getting enough protein, but it's going to be mostly from red meat, eggs, whole milk, etc. So that comes with a hefty fat total as well. Carbs will be only a bit higher than what I normally eat. Is this just what bulking is about? I feel like this is a surefire way to slop on bodyfat at a faster rate than muscle.

76izu7,"TLDR: [Progress summary.](https://imgur.com/a/JqXQp)   Hi /r/fitness I have been posting every once and awhile in physique phriday threads as well as in /r/progresspics but I never got to create a dedicated thread here on fitit to expand and document my weight-loss journey and my body transformation.    A bit of background, I celebrated last week my 27th birthday, And for ~16 years outta those I've been struggling with my body. I was 10 when I was first called fat in school and ever since that day I've been the fattest kid in the class. I sweat a lot and being born and raised in Tunisia didn't help with the high temperatures around the year. So yea basically every day in school was a shamefest. Which only worsened the issue because it made me get to hate going out and hence a vicious cycle of eating and staying home playing video-games/watching movies kicked in.    Although I always had in me a strong urge, a want to practice physical activity. I wanted to run, play soccer and whatever but my body always hindered me. At some point I gave up dieting and such because I was convinced something is definitely wrong with me.  A few years ago, I moved to Paris, France for professional reasons. I got a gym membership. I used it for a couple of months and that was that. Fast forward to August 2016, I was walking home with a friend of mine and we agreed to get our shit together and start working out consistently. Mind you at some point before this conversation I weighed around 120+kg for 167cm (264lbs for 5'5""). I was convinced I had to do something and a lot of factors that I won't bore you with played in making me just get my game on. This is me on [December 2015](https://imgur.com/a/Gnkap)    This is me in [May 2016](https://imgur.com/a/6hIK4), approximate weight 100kg (?).  August 2016, started at 98kg, August 31st I weighed 90kg. Cycling in the gym and doing whatever I can to eat less (must've been eating around 1400 calories/day but I didn't know about MFP back then). I wanted so bad to run on treadmill but I couldn't because of shin splints. For the life of me I wouldn't be able to run past the 1km marker without feeling intense pain in my forelegs.  September 2016-February 2017: Continued to shed weight fast, 4kg/month on average. All by doing intense, long cardio sessions (Some sessions were 1600 calories worth) and watching my food. At that point I had joined MyFitnessPal and started to try get my calorie count right. [February 7th 2017](https://imgur.com/a/Xs6u0) , I weighed 74.5kg my scale estimates my BF to be around 20%  which is highly inaccurate imo. This period though was a huge success for me. I had successfully ran 15km for the first time ever in 85ish minutes. And got my 10k to 49 minutes. This period of time was cardio only almost, I just wanted to become a runner like I always wished I could be.  March 2017: Started at 70.5kg still shedding weight fast, my scale estimates my BF ~17-18%. I wore a size S shirt for the first time of my life. And still looked nothing like I hoped I'd look [like](https://imgur.com/a/WxHT2). I was still counting calories at a deficit and a steep one too. But at this point I was already proud of what I have achieved, and I started to believe my body transformation is actually possible :D   May 2017: This was a major turning point. I ditched my old workout regime that made no sense. And browsed the wiki here for a program I can run that can actually help me recomp. And stumbled upon the PHUL program. I never touched a dumbbell before in my life.  Going to the free weight area in my gym alone was a MAJOR step. At this point I weighed [65kg](https://imgur.com/a/C3aDS).    I already had visible abs. Scale BF estimate was around 15%. I hit the gym 5 days a week, 4 days during the working week around 6AM because basically I was a noob and didn't wanna shame myself during rush hour lol. I benched, squatted and deadlifted and it never felt any better.    September 2017: [End of my cut](https://imgur.com/ztXAk2D) September 18th at 64kg and 13% BF, at this point I was feeling too weak in the gym. Struggling to keep my numbers and failing most of the time. I started to hate the experience of squatting or benching. I was not happy with the result I have hoped to remove some more fat, but you gotta listen to your body.  At this point I was really frustrated but recomp is one hell of a challenge, the loose skin effect is doubled with a layer of fat that wouldn't leave the belt area. But I was reasonable enough to retreat and fight another day. After this I maintained for 2 weeks, and 2 weeks ago I started a lean bulk phase. Planning to make it a short one then go back to cutting alternating for 2 weeks.    I am still experimenting with both programming and diet plans, starting to feel the need for coaching but I made it so far on my own I might as well just keep at it and have fun doing it.    So there you go guys, I tried to keep it as short as possible if you have any questions just hit me up i'm more than glad to answer.

Diet:  I basically ate all clean foods, aka “bro foods.” I counted out my calories/macros to a T, and still continue to do that. When I wanted to lose weight, I was in a caloric deficit, and when I wanted to gain, I upped the calories and whatnot.

78pnc5,"[Source](http://sci-fit.net/2017/ketogenic-diet-fat-muscle-performance/) #Summary ##The basics of keto With the ketogenic diet, you aim to eat 20 to 80g of carbohydrates per day. The body then starts using fat and ketones as primary energy sources. A high protein diet (i.e. 2.2 g/kg) does not seem to prevent ketosis. Some claim that keto is the best diet for improving body composition, endurance, and strength.  We have reviewed the ketogenic literature and come to the following conclusions: ##Fat loss  Keto does not seem to offer a distinct advantage for fat loss when both groups in a study eat the same amount of calories. People on the ketogenic diet typically lose body weight quicker, but this is most likely due to glycogen depletion and water loss. The most commonly measured ketone body, Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), does not seem to correlate with fat loss. However, this depends on which studies we include and exclude from our analysis. Go to ketone levels and fat loss for graphs, details, and discussion. ##Muscle mass  We generally see greater lean body mass (LBM) loss in ketogenic diet groups. Note that lean body mass contains water, glycogen, and muscle protein, by definition. It is hard to say with certainty that LBM loss implies greater “dry” muscle protein loss. “Wet” LBM can come and go quickly because it consists of water and glycogen. ##Endurance performance  Most studies suggest that aerobic and anaerobic performance is either impaired or maintained on a ketogenic diet. However, many of the studies have small sample sizes, no control group, or are quite short (2-6 weeks). These limitations, and many others, reduce our ability to draw strong conclusions. ##Strength performance  Control groups tend to gain more strength than keto, yet most studies find no statistically significant differences between groups. In most studies, the keto group ate more protein than control. We can’t rightfully compare them without matching protein and total energy. Several of the studies do not measure ketosis. ##Individual diet responses  The data we have discussed in this article deals with how people respond on average. However, individuals can respond very differently to the same diet. Some have a lot of success on keto, and some do not. Hence, one diet might not work for you, but perhaps another will. The graph below shows what happens before and after 5 people were put on a ketogenic diet. Their endurance, as measured by time to exhaustion, varied from person to person (Phinney et al., 1983). (Graph in article) ##Issues in keto research The keto literature has many issues, conflicts of interest, and limitations. Here are some examples: - Many studies do not measure blood ketone levels, meaning we do not know if the participants were in a ketogenic state or not. - Many studies do not directly track how much the study participants ate. We are then “forced” to trust that the participants ate the amount of carbs they were assigned. - Keto groups tend to eat more protein and less calories than control groups. - Many studies have poor methodology or experimental design. - (lack of) carbohydrates affect body composition estimations.",https://imgur.com/gallery/aJ0dR,984
794wp9,"TL;DR: [Front](https://imgur.com/a/vJXAZ) Hey guys, I can't believe another 6 months have passed already! Some of you might remember my last progress post; you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/67pxj1/6_month_progress_125lbs147lbs/).  **Background:** Not much has changed in the year. I was for the most part sedentary for all of high school, and wanted to get back into physical activities. Within this year, I've been playing in different intramural sports and I've looked to pick up Brazilian jiu jitsu (started 2 weeks ago). **Training:** Over these last 6 months I have been running n-suns 5/3/1 5 day routine. I started with the 4 day routine, but found i really wanted to increase my OHP as well as being a big fan of incline bench. My accessories are focused around a lot  forearm and grip work. Outside of the main tier lifts of the program, my most important exercise is weighted pull ups. I do a standard 5x5 3 days a week of weighted pull ups outside of squat and deadlift days. Lastly I workout on Saturday doing a light fun day of whatever I'm really feeling like, but mostly just hanging out on a stationary bike.  Now for my actually main lifts I'll include my 6 month 1RM as reference: **Bench:** 65lbs ---> 135lbs  ---> 170lbs  **Squat:** 65lbs ---> 225lbs  ---> 265lbs **Deadlift:** 135lb ---> 275lbs  ---> 345lbs Sadly my squat and bench are really starting to fall behind my deadlift. Squats have never really felt that clean, but recently I've changed my stance up a little bit and it's started to really kick in. Benching I really don't know what I'm doing that wrong. I've been told by plenty of people that I should have a much heavy bench than I do.  **Diet:** Now to the root of the problem. Over the first 6 months I gained 22lbs in 6 months so around 3 and a half pounds a month which I found a little slow, but almost perfect to being 1lb a week. Now over this last 6 months, I've only gained 8 pounds. I basically have been eating at maintenance on a bulk. I've really been beating myself up over not eating like I should have.At one point I had a 220 day streak of counting my calories, but that is now long gone. It just seemed like I hit 150lbs and eating in a surplus became impossible. I feel like I'm slipping back into my old habit of not eating, and I know i could have made a lot more gains if I ate like I should have.  Again I just want to say thank you guys for the nice words I read from my posts as well as other r/fitness threads. It's a fitness community you can't find anywhere else on the internet.        ",This makes me realize how weak my abs work have been. ,443
7alu2z,"A few days ago a user on r/bodyweightfitness asked for help in regards to them clenching their jaw during exercise because it was causing a lot of tension to the rest of their skull. I ended up making a video-answer showing how I release the tension of my masseter (jaw) muscle using self-massage and thought I'd share it with you here as well. #What/Where is the Masseter Muscle [The masseter](https://i.imgur.com/VGKc5y7.png) is a mandibular muscle that closes your jaw shut and activates anytime you chew, which you do many times a day. It's technically the most important muscle in your body because if you can't chew and eat your food properly, you die. (Barring smoothie/ice cream technology, of course!) And because it works so often and hard, it can cause issues as well. You can stretch it by trying to open your mouth as much as possible but self-massaging it is just as important of a tool in my opinion. #Link: https://youtu.be/w-c1rt4zSGY This self-massage trick is one of those I always incorporate in the middle of a yoga routine or self-massage routine. If you have clenching problems or get a lot of tension headaches or have TMJ disorder, it's definitely one of those things you could try as well and see if it provides relief. Anyway, I hope it helps you out!","Nice video! I've used a lacrosse ball on that muscle as well, but it's good to be able to do it without one. Also, let's hear it for the true star of the video: your dog. ",231

I know about the harm to the community by claiming all-natural and not being all-natural. It gives others a false sense of what can be accomplished in a certain amount of time, and discouraging them when aren't able to accomplish the same. I'm sure some people have felt like shit and gave up on their fitness journey because of that, and that sucks. On the inverse, how do you think it feels to have actually put in the hours the effort of eating right only to be told ""nope, your results aren't real."" How much do you think THAT sucks? How much do you think that *helps* the community? Whatever the case, I know I'm telling the truth. If you can't take anything from this because you don't believe me, then fine. If I encouraged you to take your fitness to another level, great. I'll still answer those questions wondering about my regiment. I'm going to ignore all accusations of ""being on gear"" unless you're willing to meet up with me in LA, go with me to a drug test, then eating a dick when I come back PED-negative. Cheers. ------ EDIT 2: Thanks so much to the folks offering support. I hope I've inspired at least one person in some way. Answering the most common questions/comments below. * How tall are you? - I am 5'9 (Always thought I was 5'10, sadly I don't think I am lol) * How old are you? - I am 31, turning 32 on the 26th of November * How long do you spend at the gym? - About 2 hours a day. My gym has a 2-hour limit on parking, so I try to keep my workouts under 2 hours so I can move my car and take a shower/steam room without paying extra ;) * Why a bodybuilding split rather than a PPL? - I used to do a PPL, and while my gains came quick for strength, I am not as concerned with strength level than I am with size/aesthetic. * You are overtraining small muscles. - I don't feel like I am, to be honest. My arms are no longer sore after bicep / tricep days, and I feel like arm size adds a lot to my aesthetic. So I split them. Like I say below, I listen to my body - if I feel like I overtrain them, I would change; but I'm getting good results from the current split. * You aren't training legs enough. - This is correct. I haven't done legs regularly for my entire gym ""career"" until now. They are taking a long time to get to the pace of the rest of my muscles. When I feel like they're catching up, I will increase workload on them. * What do you take in terms of stack/supplements? - I take [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EE5DCT2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for pre-workout, and [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018S8L842/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for weight gainer. I take a multi-vitamin Centrum candy because I like the way it tastes, lol. ----- Posted before, but lots of people asked about my routine and I wasn't able to type it out till now. Plus, I just hit my personal milestone of 160lbs! I'm sure this doesn't need to be said anymore, but this is what works for ME. Listen to your body, take what works for you from this, and ignore what doesnt. **Quick notes about myself:** * Hard gainer - my resting metabolic rate is nearly 2,000 calories. * I don't do ANY cardio, aside from hitting a heavy bag every now and then. * Been lifting on and off since I was 20, but just recently put it in high gear and dieting properly due to needs at work (I act for a living) * I developed an intolerance to gluten (or whatever the fuck is in things that contain gluten that make me feel like shit), so it's forced me to lay off shitty foods (McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Panda Express were staples of my diet) * I NEVER used to work legs, so finally giving them the attention they deserve. I will be adding exercises to leg day as I get stronger. **On overall routine:**   I use the body building method of working one body part a day. My overall goal is not strength, but size and appearance. However, I did throw in a deadlift day to work overall strength. Rest days come in whenever. I just listen to my body and take rest days when I feel like I need them. * Day 1 - Chest * Day 2 - Back * Day 3 - Legs * Day 4 - Triceps * Day 5 - Biceps * Day 6 - Shoulders * Day 7 - Deadlift/Abs **On exercise order:** I generally will start any day with more compound movements, working my way into more isolated movements. For example, chest day starts with the dumbell press, and ends with a machine flye. The idea behind this is putting more work the stabilizer muscles early, while the main muscle is still fresh and able to lift heavier weight. **On sets/reps:**   My ""template"" is a 5x5. However, I am very loose with this. If I start with a weight that I can do 10 reps with, I do 10 reps. If I get to set 4 and can only do 3 reps, I will repeat that set with the same weight and do 3 more, lowering the weight on the next set. Sometimes, if I feel up to it, I will do 6 or 7 sets. It really comes down to listening to my body and adjusting accordingly. After all, my muscles don't know how many reps I did. It just knows how much work they're doing. **On diet:**   100%, the most immediately effective change I've made in terms of my health/physique. I don't count macros super well, but I eat relatively healthy. Due to my work schedule and inability to always have regular meals, I have also begun taking a weight gainer, which I take 3 half-servings of, spaced throughout the day. (1 serving is 1300 calories). I will add another half-serving if I miss a meal. A basic day goes as follows: * Breakfast: 2 hash browns, 4 strips of uncured turkey bacon, a LOT of egg whites (don't know how much, just pour it into the pan) * Half-serving of weight gainer * Lunch: 1/2 white, 1/2 brown Rice (can't have bread), a protein of choice (usually ground turkey, steak, chicken breast, or salmon), and broccoli * Half-serving of weight gainer * Dinner: Repeat lunch * Half-serving of weight gainer Snacks fit in there wherever I can fit them. I have a bag of walnuts on my desk that I munch on often. **Excercise breakdown:**   *Chest Day*   1. Flat Dumbbell Press   2. Incline Dumbbell Press   3. Flat Bench Press   4. Low-to-High Cable Flyes   5. Pec-Deck Flye -or- Cable Flyes   *Back Day*   1. Wide-Grip Pull-ups   2. Close Neutral Grip Pull-ups   3. Pendlay Rows   4. Dumbbell Rows   5. Dumbbell Pullovers   6. Neutral Grip Cable Rows   7. Wide Grip Lat Pulldown   *Leg Day*   1. Squats   2. Leg Press   3. Hamstring Curls   4. Calf Raises (usually many sets of this, working to a heavy weight to failure, then back down to failure)   *Tricep Day*   1. Close-Grip Bench Press   2. Skullcrushers   3. Rope Tricep Extensions   4. Dumbbell Tricep Extensions   5. Dips (25-30 reps for 4 sets)   6. Tricep Machine   *Bicep Day*   1. EZ-Bar Curls   2. Incline Bench Curls   3. Rope Curls   4. Hercules Curls -or- Single-Arm Hercules Curls   5. Bicep Machine   6. Drop Set Alternating Dumbbell Curls - to failure   *Shoulder Day*   1. Behind the head Barbell Press   2. Standard Barbell Press   3. Lateral Dumbbell Raises   4. Single-arm Lateral Cable Raises   5. Front Lateral Dumbbell Raises   6. Bent Over Dumbbell Raises   7. Reverse Pec-Deck Flyes   8. Dumbbell Shrugs -or- Barbell Shrugs   *Deadlift/Ab Day*   1. Deadlifts   2. Ab Wheel   3. Windshield Wipers   4. Ab Machine  ","You know what, all these people here claiming that there's no way you could've done that without juicing are **the exact same people** who will moan about Karen in the office who tells them they're only lean because of genetics, or because they're young with a high metabolism. It feels like shit to have all your hard work invalidated because people think ""wow there's no way *I* could do that, so I'm going to assume he's lying so I can feel better about myself"" I can't say for sure if you're natty or not, but neither can anyone else. On the bright side, if your gains are in fact natty then I think you can take it as a compliment that you've made such insane progress people can't believe you did it naturally.",626
7bqbba,"[Progress Pics :)](https://imgur.com/gallery/Td4Nk) [EDIT TO PROVE MY TATTOO STILL EXISTS LOL](https://imgur.com/gallery/gJ9TH)   TLDR; I was unhappy and now I am happy. Do what works for you, but this is my journey!   BACKSTORY (not pictured): I was a skinny kid until I hit puberty and went from skin and bones to fat, my heaviest I've weighed was 73kgs (I'm 5'7"") or 160lbs and I was so so unhappy. At the end of high school I hurt my body, was depressed and ended up just not eating. I dropped about 20kgs or 45lbs in just under a year. I lost A LOT of weight, my period, but I gained what I though was happiness.   DIET: basically a whole jar of nutella erryday. WEIGHT: 73kgs / 160lbs   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT FIRST PIC: was taken in 2014, just before my 21st birthday.   I was starving myself, unhappy and struggling with depression. My skin was tired and you could see all of my ribs, but I was bloated 100% of the time and had severe reactions to eating wheat / dairy because I had restricted them from my diet for so long. I had literally given myself an intolerance to food.   I was a cardio whore, and did nothing but HIIT workouts or long 10km + walks, I didn't know anything about strength training and thought you achieved the 'perfect body' by eating nothing and working out 24/7.   I remained this way for over 2 years!!!!!!! :O   DIET: lots and lots of salads, low fat yogurt, and high protein, fruit but still low carb WEIGHT: 52kgs - 56kgs / 120lbsish   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   SECOND PIC: taken about a year ago, I was going to the gym and did HIIT workouts both in classes (like body pump) or on my own. I gained confidence to start making my own workouts, but still though cardio was the only way to look long and lean. I wanted a six pack so so so bad! I was still terrified of eating carbs, and I would think about eating all the time - perpetually hungry and getting nowhere.   DIET: carbs in my breakfast, i.e. muesli but pretty much the same as the above. But I was eating MORE of it WEIGHT: 58kgs ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   THIRD PIC: taken January 2017. Old habits die hard, I had just gotten back from a 4 week trip to Canada and the US. I thought I would get fat by enjoying christmas a little toooo much so I restricted my eating. I got horribly sick with a few chest / ear infections, and was walking around 25kms per day - obviously not good for the body and I'm so sad that I did this.   DIET: I was eating out every day basically for a month, and was enjoying noodle soups, bagels and chocolate - but wasn't eating a ton WEIGHT: not sure, but roughly around 57kgs   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   FOURTH PIC: taken in May 2017. My best friend has been doing weights for a few years now, and had encouraged me to give it a go. I was skeptical at first but I LOVED the way my body felt, strong and sexy so I switched gyms and we started going daily. We both made a commitment to eating MORE food, including a healthy portion of carbs with EVERY meal and to keeping each other on tracker. I was eating around 2300 calories per day   DIET: we slowly INCREASED CARB INTAKE from around Feb 2017 onwards (still going lols), to try and REPAIR YEARS OF DAMAGE that we had already done. I would eat a mostly large carb / protein breakfast - large as I workout in the morning only - yes I wake up at 5AM, and yes I sleep by 9PM :) I would eat carbs and lunch and then mostly protein and whatever fats I had left over I was tracking macros to make sure I was EATING ENOUGH, and not convince myself that I didn't need to eat things I started enjoying chocolate, and savory food - can you believe that I thought making a cheeesy sandwich would kill me and now I devour about 10million a week? WEIGHT: 60kgs /  132lbs   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   FINAL PIC: taken today. I'm happy, I'm healthy. I feel full and strong. I can squat 150lbs 4x10, deadlift 1RM 100kgs and can run for miles. I can do chin ups and the abs are slowly poking through as I do a mini mini cut for summer (I live in Aust). My butt is finally cooperating and stubbornly growing cm by cm.   I lift about 5 days a week, following a body upper and lower (2x LOWER and 2 x UPPER /  1x whatever I feel like). I ride my bike to and from work, or walk. I enjoy my strength and am keen to see where I am in a year's time from now.   DIET: I've just started a mini mini cut, so sitting at around 1800 calories per day. I eat around 150 C, 140 P, 70 F but really just eat whatever I feel like and don't count calories. I used to be terrified of carbs, but now they make up for the most of my meals and my body responds so well. Yes I gained some fat, but it's SOOOO much easier to lose now I know what I am doing.  It's about eating in a deficit or surplus, nothing else. Forget carbs, protein and fat. You either eat MORE or LESS than you need - but make sure you do it safely as it has taken years to realize. WEIGHT: 65kgs (AND I HAVE ABS) yes, real abs poking through   TLDR;  I was unhappy and now I am happy. Do what works for you, but this is my journey!   I've written a wall of text but I wish someone had told me this stuff in the beginning, but then again what's life without a few mistakes?","Girl, the booty  huge grats on the progress and thank you for this honest write up.

7cfzgf,"Over the last 10 months I decided to turn my life around. Gave up booze and started my journey to a healthy lifestyle. By focusing on CICO, eating healthy, and going to the gym 3-5 times a week I was able to drop 77 lbs. At my heaviest back in January of last year I was 232 lbs, 5’9”and 36 yrs old, I mildly watched my diet the first 4 months and dropped maybe 15 lbs. In may I really started to think about health and that’s when I started CICO, at first I was running off about 1200 calories but that was just too little so I brought it up to 1500 and every 4 weeks I would have a week around 18-1900. I also started at a gym back in may, at first it was my local city rec center just to get comfortable and figure out what this working out thing was. Shortly after I joined another gym in town and started a basic ppl program. Since then I left that gym and joined a new one just due to my work schedule and it allows me to use multiple locations in multiple cities so when I’m away I don’t have a excuse to skip. Currently I am doing a 5/3/1 but really want to dial in my program as I am still kind of all over the place. Most of my lifts aren’t to good yet so I’ll skip them until I get better results but all I can say is I did get to 3 plates on a deadlift this week for 2 ugly reps!  Up next I’m going to now start upping my calories up to about 25-2600 and Work on muscle growth. Goal is to increase another 10lbs of muscle by January 2019 by bulking and cutting and stay around the 10-12% BF. Upping the clean eating is probably going to be the hard part as even now on my 1900 weeks it feels that I was having to really focus at getting higher healthy calories in. Think I will just add slightly bigger portions and 1-2 extra meals per day. I generally always meal prep and make a dz meals of 4-5oz of lean protein and rice and a form of veg that make up a 400-450 calorie meal and will go from 2 to 4 of those per day.    Thanks r/fitness for all the tips and tricks you have gave me!  [progress photo](https://imgur.com/gallery/GzJ46)",Overnight steel cut oat is a very healthy bulk addition.  You sit the oat out overnight at 2:1 water to oats ratio.  I use 1.5- two cups of dry oats which is 1200 calories with 2 cut up bananas and flavored protein powder.  So 1000-1500 calories.  You could do less as my bulk is 3000 calories.  The overnight preparation soaks up less water than cooking makes it less dense/ bulky.  Its a great way to start the day.,303
7daoa2,"Hi, I just wanted to share the progress I've made these past few years since I finally hit some nice milestones! Pictures and videos are at the bottom of the post. If you have any questions, tips or whatever, feel free to post! ##PROGRESS STORY AND WORKOUT PROGRAM DETAILS: I first began exercising in May 2015 as the typical skinny gamer nerd guy weighing in at 115 lbs (https://i.imgur.com/ZtTHJ3c.jpg). For the first few months, I followed a bodyweight program due to feeling too intimidated to go to the gym. I started drinking a ton of milk every day, almost gomad, just to gain weight. I didn't keep track of calories in this time. I started going to the gym Around October-November 2015, and began with stronglifts 5x5. The app and website were extremely helpful in getting me accustomed to the primary lifts and took away some of the intimidation factor of going into the gym. I followed stronglifts pretty consistently until April where I reached 155 lbs (https://i.imgur.com/k3vij7m.jpg), eating with a ~500 caloric surplus or more every day.  At that point, I asked reddit for advice, and a few people told me to cut so I began eating at a 500 deficit. I also used to play a ton of basketball, so I lost 10 lbs pretty fast in about a month. During my cut, I switched to PHUL since trying to do 5x5 squats was absolutely miserable on a cut. I also felt like my upper body was neglected, and PHUL had a lot more variety in that area. In between I bulked way too hard and made little progress so in January 2017 I was back at 155 lbs (https://i.imgur.com/eR8mvuR.jpg). I dialed it back down, cutting down to 134 by august (https://imgur.com/MavWGVR).  I began bulking more cleanly this time. I went from doing PHUL to 5-day nSuns and have made a lot of progress in all of my lifts. In the 4 months I've been doing nsuns, I've eaten at a 2800 calorie diet (supposedly ~400 surplus according to https://tdeecalculator.net/) and my body weight has gone from 134 to 138 lbs. My lifts have drastically improved with bench increasing from 185x5 to 225x3 and squat increasing from 275x5 to 315x3. https://i.imgur.com/hh816bf.jpg (More final physique pictures at bottom of post).  ##TIPS:     If you're a beginner don't actually start with stronglifts 5x5! Squats every day made me a T-rex with huge quads and no upper body. I'd recommend beginners start with the more balanced Greyskull's LP that you can find in this subreddit's sidebar.  I was suffering from shoulder impingement issues for a long time, but adding in rehab exercises such as band pull aparts, face-pulls, and lying down side raises helped significantly. Also, I worked on getting my form better, and learned the cue of trying to pull the bar apart laterally. This cue helped me greatly to reduce strain on my shoulders and activate my back more to create the back ""shelf"" to bench on. Also I incorporated this upper body stretching routine into my workouts (minus the controversial sleeper stretch) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgxr6xAB5ZM.  For squat, switching from high to low bar helped me push through some nagging pains and plateaus. Additionally, figuring out the valsalva maneuver and using a belt helped my form greatly. For lower body days, I always made sure to do stretching routine limber 11 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSSDLDhbacc.  nSuns is a great program and I'd recommend you get on it as soon as you stop making progress with a linear progression scheme. I feel like I wasted a lot of time doing PHUL and the progress just wasn't there comparatively. You can learn more about nSuns here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nSuns/. I did the 5-day variant since I like the dedicated overhead press day, but any format should work fine.   DO NOT DIRTY BULK OR YOU'LL LOOK AND FEEL BAD (https://i.imgur.com/eR8mvuR.jpg) DRINK A TON OF WATER. I probably drink close to a gallon of water daily. It just makes you feel better overall. Your muscles are mostly water so it'll also help with strength.   BE CONSISTENT WITH BOTH DIET AND EXERCISE. Skipping a day or even a week isn't the end of the world, but if you have the spare time, go to the gym. Having a huge meal or drinking with friends on occasion is totally fine as long as you're sticking to the diet the other 90% of the time.  STRETCH AND FOAM ROLL. Mobility creep is real and you have to adapt.  I mention which stretches I do in the previous part about shoulder problems and lower body work.  GET A FOOD SCALE AND TRACK WHAT YOU CAN. Keep a mental record of things you ate and add the calories up in your head or just in your phone calculator app. This is a relatively hassle-free way of tracking your daily intake.  GYM IS THE EASIEST GAME. In League or Overwatch you lose rank sometimes if you play badly or your team sucks. In gym, you will always gain elo regardless of how shitty you do that day. The only way to demote in gym is with ranked decay, but this can easily be circumvented by playing ~3 games a week.   ##DIET AND SUPPLEMENTS DURING LEAN BULK (~last 3 months):      My diet during this bulk wasn't anything too special, though I always made sure to keep high protein intake (at least 120g a day). My typical daily meal is a chipotle bowl with double chicken, 4 slices of bread with peanut butter, 2 bowls of cereal + milk, and filler food to meet the rest of my caloric goals (usually fruits or eggs). I also took several daily supplements, including 5g creatine, 3g fish oil (EPA+DPA), 5000 IU vitamin D, 3g Beta Alanine, and a multivitamin. I often mixed and used my own preworkout following the instructions from this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/377g6n/why_i_make_my_own_preworkout_and_you_should_too/. ##BEST IN SLOT EQUIPS:  Of course lifting gear won't make or break your progress, but certain items really help when grinding for that next highest ilvl. This could just be all placebo, but hey, anything that helps helps. I suggest you only use them on heavier loads though, since relying too much on them could hinder the development of the smaller muscles involved.  Olympic lifting shoes (I wear adipowers) are great if you're looking to get more depth out of your squat. They also allow me to squat very narrow which I find is stronger for me.  Knee sleeves also add a bit of spring to your squat and help slightly with knee valgus. I found that SBDs were superior to rehbands in this regard after trying both. Knee sleeves also double as shin pads when doing conventional deadlift.  The Belt is perhaps more useful than both of these. Most gyms will have these at the front desk if you just ask, so learn how to use it! The belt combined with proper valsalva maneuver helped me overcome some form problems and back pains when pushing for heavy deadlifts and squats.  Wrist Wraps are useful for ensuring your wrist stays straight on heavy benches if your wrists are particularly small like mine. I just use a 10 dollar pair from amazon.  Chalk is great for bench and deadlift if you have clammy hands like me.  Wrist Straps are useful for grip limited exercises such as power shrugs, rack pulls, and possibly front squat if your mobility is lacking.  Preworkout is not neccessary, but something I find very useful. If I feel lethargic or unmotivated that day, taking preworkout will force me to use the energy in the gym. It also helps me push for new PRs which are sometimes quite scary (especially squat). If you're gonna raid you gotta bring flasks.  Foam roller is last but certainly not least. I believe this is an essential item to have and using it to properly stretch will benefit you greatly. Mobility and strength go hand in hand. Consistently foam rolling and stretching will not only make your lifts safer, but also stronger. A lacrosse ball can also be considered for more intense pinpoint rolling for some real problem spots such as hip flexors.    ##LIFTING STATS PROGRESSION: May 2015     bodyweight: 115 lbs     lifts: nonexistant July 2016     bodyweight: 145 lbs     Bench: 145 5x3     Squat: 235 5x3     Deadlift: 235 5x3     OH Press: 85 5x3     November 2017     bodyweight: 138 lbs     Bench: 225x3     Squat: 315x3     Deadlift: 335x4     OH Press: 135x2     On a side-note I've been curious about getting into powerlifting but have no idea what good numbers would be.

7fircq,"Yesterday I hit a 455lb / 207kg deadlift, which brought my total up to 1,002lb. I am super psyched! When I started out I couldn't even imagine this was even possible. Bodyweight between 137 and 140lb (~63kg).   **Videos of lifts**  [Squat 347lb / 157.5kg + stiff bar comp deadlift of 435lb / 197.5kg](https://www.instagram.com/p/BazV42yj3X-/?taken-by=pumping.fe) [Bench 200lb / 90.7kg](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZejN6_jhwv/?taken-by=pumping.fe) [Deadlift 455lb / 207kg on deadlift bar](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb5RP48D6b6/?taken-by=pumping.fe)  **Past Training**  I've been lifting off and on since the summer of 2011, so about 6.5 years. I started powerlifting training specifically in the fall of 2013, my 1st powerlifting meet was summer 2014 after reddit told me I was actually pretty good and should compete, lol. I was 110lb / 50kg when I started lifting. I was self coached up until this past summer when I started working with RTS and Mike.  I did starting strength my 1st year of powerlifting but stalled out around the time I did my 1st meet. My numbers were S:245 B:135 D:335 @120lb bodyweight. After that, I switched to a PPL x2 that I wrote. I did that for another year and a half till my lifts were around S: 275 B:150 D:405. I then started an upper/lower split where I did bench 2x a week and squat + deadlifts 2x a week but I alternated which I focused on as the main lift. I was on that until I started coaching with RTS. My lifts were S:315 B:175 D:425 and bodyweight was 128 out of comp.  **Current Training**  I decided to go up a weight class at that time, from 125 (57kg) to 138 (63kg). I am 5'5 so I was doing myself a huge disservice competing in the 57kg class where everyone else was a half foot smaller than me. Since going up 4 months ago, my lifts have increased dramatically and so has my wilks! RTS had me on an upper/lower split similar to my old one till I competed at USAPL Raw Nationals last month.  Since Nationals, I have been on a full body routine 4x a week, with a bench variation each workout as well as a squat or deadlift variation and accessories. The volume each workout is low to make up for the high frequency. It took my joints and muscles about 3 weeks to get used to the frequency. I seem to be handling it ok now. The deadlift PR was a total YOLO move on my part and not programmed at all :). I wanted to play with the deadlift bar. This was my 2nd time ever using one, with the 1st being back in 2014. [Progress photos](https://imgur.com/a/2Q4FG).  **Diet** Pretty relaxed. I suck at eating so my #1 goal is just getting my calories. I maintain around 2200-2500. My #2 goal is getting enough protein. I aim for 100g bare minimum and 160g+ when I am prepping for a comp. For supplements, I use protein powder and sometimes take creatine. I take a multivitamin, fish oil, vitamin D, zinc, magnesium, and melatonin every night before bed.    ",Holy shit congrats,1451
7icizp,"**Link:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28768407/ **Abstract:** ""Since 2006, type 1 diabetes in Finland has plateaued and then decreased after the authorities' decision to fortify dietary milk products with cholecalciferol. The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter. Actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from vitamin D deficiency."" **Conclusion:** ""Unfortunately, medicine took a very long time to realize that vitamin D is not simply a vitamin that prevents rickets. For that purpose, 400-600 IU/d may be enough. However, we know today that vitamin D is a powerful nuclear receptor-activating hormone of critical importance, especially to the immune system. With the available data mentioned above, the proposed doses would probably suffice to maintain vitamin D levels around or over 75-100 nmol/L, with practically zero risk of toxicity. Undeniably, further studies are needed to clarify the optimal supplementation of vitamin D, although it is uncertain whether a universal recommended dietary allowance is feasible. Meanwhile, actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from the threats posed by vitamin D deficiency."" **tl;dr:** Talk to your physician about measuring your Vitamin D levels and see if supplementing more would be a good idea. (You probably shouldn't take more than 10,000 IU, though.)","Yeah...I found out when I was younger that either I'm a vampire or I don't process the VitD from the sun. My levels were tested twice, once below 10 and the other at 13. This was...maybe 15 years ago? Doctors tested me for all sorts of things - originally they thought I had mono or some auto-immune issues....but it was ""just"" a severe VitD deficiency.  Went on a very high dosage at that time to help (50,000 IU once per week). Then last year I had a similar thing happen (levels were in the 30s...) and I went back on a 3k daily supplement.  I'm supposed to be on more now, but I forgot to take it since I moved...probably why I've been tired/depressed lately. Thanks for the reminder!  ",539

7lrrvu,"M/21/5’8”   Starting BW: 140lbs (63.5kg)   Current BW: 160lbs (72.5kg)   **pics:**   [July 2017](https://i.imgur.com/zNMxhbI.jpg)/[December 2017](https://i.imgur.com/AlYw562.jpg)      October of 2016 I hit 180lbs and looked and felt like shit. Started doing cardio 1-2 times/week and cut calories. July of 2017 I was around 145 lbs and took my fitness a step further and started working out at home every day. I didn’t have a weight set, but I had a pair of 20lb dumbells and a pull up bar that I worked with and did lots of pushups and core. My routine wasn’t very structured, but I made sure to work as much of my body as I could for about an hour/day.   August/September 2017 started going to the gym regularly. Started on a somewhat makeshift 6 day split a friend helped me make. Saw decent progress and was feeling really good. Switched to Metallicadpa’s PPL 6 days/week around October, this is when I started making some actual strength gains.       **Lifts:**   Bench: 75lbs (34kg) -> 150lbs (68kg) 5x5   Squat: 95lbs (43kg) -> 190lbs (86kg) 3x5   Overhead Press: 65lbs (29.5kg) -> 105lbs (47.5kg) 5x5   Deadlift: 135lbs (61kg) -> 230lbs (104kg) 3x5      **Routine** (made slight modifications to Metallicadpa’s routine):      PULL   Deadlifts 3x5+/Barbell rows 4x5, 1x5+ (alternate, so if you did deadlifts on Monday, you would do rows on Thursday, and so on)   3x8-12 Pulldowns OR Pullups   3x8-12 seated cable rows OR t-bar rows   5x15-20 face pulls SS 5x8-12 hyperextensions   3x10 chinups    4x8-12 hammer curls OR ez bar preacher curls   4x8-12 concentration curls      PUSH   4x5, 1x5+ bench press/4x5, 1x5+ overhead press (alternate in the same fashion as the rows and deadlifts)   3x8-12 overhead press/3x8-12 bench press (do the opposite movement: if you bench pressed first, overhead press here)   4x8-12 incline dumbbell press (2 sets @ 30 degrees, 2 sets @ 60 degrees)   3x8-12 triceps pushdowns SS 3x15-20 lateral raises   3x8-12 overhead triceps extensions SS 3x15-20 lateral raises   4x10+ pushups      LEGS   4x5, 1x5+ squat   3x8-12 Romanian Deadlift   3x8-12 leg press SS 5x15-20 calves (last 2 sets of calves are not supersetted)   3x8-12 leg curls   4x12-15 cable crunches, sometimes high rep regular crunches   4x25 lying weighted leg raises SS 4x25 obliques      I finish every workout with planks, including leg + ab day. Cardio was a little weird. I like to warm up with a 5 minute run at 7.5mph. I do 10-15 minutes of stairclimber post workout a few times/week and while on campus I do a HIIT circuit flipping and smacking tires with a sledge hammer twice/week. For Winter break I’ve been doing Muay Thai kickboxing twice/week instead of the HIIT circuit.         **Diet:**   Diet was strict in the beginning. I was still eating at a slight caloric deficit July-September, started bulking in September. Being on my school’s meal plan it was hard to eat cleanly and still get enough calories. I was a bit less strict at this time, I ate out occasionally. I didn’t track everything, but I think I was around 3000 calories/day during the bulk.      Typical day:   Breakfast: Cereal/Oatmeal, scoop of whey   Snack: Banana/Almonds   Lunch: Whatever the dining hall is serving. I try to eat whatever protein source they have(usually some kind of chicken or beef) and veggies if they have them. Very hard to be consistent with this meal   Dinner: Same as lunch   Post Workout: Protein shake (scoop of whey, banana, peanut butter)      Supps: Whey protein, Creatine, Glucosamine Chondroitin (I have shitty joints)         Original plan was to start a cut in mid January, but I’m going to continue the bulk since I haven’t hit my goals yet. The next program I plan on trying is The Viking’s Bare Bones ULPPL split, but I’m open to suggestions.      Thanks guys, this subreddit was my main source of information.

7mh3m6,"Hi,  Just wanted to post this and give a few details for those who are not feeling good about themselves and need a bit of a push. I know many read this forum in the hopes of getting a glimmer of insight into what to do to be happy about their bodies. https://imgur.com/vPfknTc All sorts of methods work, this is mine. I'm 5'10 and 37 years old. 250lbs then, 200lbs now. Diet : I ate less, instead of 5 slices of pizza and a large diet coke, I'd eat 2 slices of pizza and water. Everything in moderation, my fridge and freezer have everything in them, but I eat less of it. Ice Cream, beer, pizza, chicken, burgers, mcdonalds etc. Instead of one Mcdouble and a large diet coke, i'll eat 1 mcdouble with no drink or fries. If i feel like ice cream such as a mcflurry or dairy queen, instead of jumping in the car, i'll get my boots on and walk to the restaurant so i'm burning half the calories just getting there and back. Total calories in the day is about 2200-2400 Exercise : This is what I do. Sunday : Bench 5x5 + 2x15 and then throw in skull crushers or just tricep pull downs on the rope. Tuesday : Deadlifts or just back exercises like seated rows or dumbbell rows + biceps(usually sloppy curls in the mirror) Wednesday : Bench 5x15 and then shoulder press, either in the squat rack as a standing military press or I use a machine. Saturday : Squats, I change it up a lot on this day, my favorite is the paused front squat, seems to burn the most.(I pause right at the bottom for 3 seconds) As for sets and reps, always changes. Before every workout I walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes at 15% incline @ 3mph, that according to the treadmill burns 880 calories an hour. If i'm short on time, i'll run at 13mph for 20 seconds, rest for 40 seconds and rinse and repeat for 6 running sessions I'm not old but i'm not young either, so my max lifts fluctuate with my weight and food in-take, I find injuries crop up as I get older. Max lifts are, bench is 325lbs, deadlift is 505lbs and squat 405lbs, depending on my in-take and weight.  One of the biggest pros to all of this is my energy levels and confidence, this might seem very stupid, but your dick does look bigger when your lose weight, if that isn't motivation enough I don't know what is, unless your huge already :/ My waist dropped from 40 to 34, and even now I can get a thumb or two in the jeans so i'm more like a 33, so its easier to find clothes, another benefit. Hope you all can find your own method and motivation. edit, thanks for the gold! wow. and the pic difference is 3 years,  ",You're lighting a fire under my fat ass.  I'm about where you started.  I need to get myself back in to it!  I'm basically the same body height and everything but heavier.   I'm going to have to get serious.  Thanks for giving me a kick to the ass.,1441
7mnia6,"A compelling long read from The Guardian describing the who, what and why of the clean eating movement -- and its links to disordered eating. I think it's hard to comprehend just how pervasive this movement has been in our society and how we are all changing our behaviours and language in response.  The history the author has compiled brings to light a number of issues with the movement, including something that I have always struggled with -- that loudest voices in the room are young, traditionally beautiful, able-bodied women who are convinced that their diet changes are all that is stopping the general populace from also becoming all of the above.

I thought this was very interesting: >Thinking about the event on the train home, I realised that the crowd were angry with us not because they disagreed with the details (it’s pretty clear that you can’t have sugar in “sugar-free” recipes), but because they disliked the fact that we were arguing at all. To insist on the facts made us come across as cruelly negative. We had punctured the happy belief-bubble of glowiness that they had come to imbibe from Shaw. It’s striking that in many of the wellness cookbooks, mainstream scientific evidence on diet is seen as more or less irrelevant, not least because the gurus see the complacency of science as part of what made our diets so bad in the first place.

7mustt,"https://imgur.com/a/iG1pO ** ↓ Scroll down for stats, nutrition, etc. ↓** I had been 100 lbs. soaking wet for as long as I could remember. I recall desperately attempting all the cardio I could muster in vain attempts to gain some “shape”, to no avail. Obviously.  In 2014, I was diagnosed with PCOS. Over the course of two years, I’d gained nearly 40 lbs (some of that being muscle as I’d started lifting by that point) and felt utterly defeated. My fiancé looked like a chiseled Greek god while I felt like his chubby, awkward, insecure girlfriend that people probably pitied.  After years of crippling insecurity and painfully slow results, I decided in 2016 that I’d be the best I could be for both myself and my fiancé - no excuses. If I gave up, I was weak. If I made excuses, I was weak. I lost 15 lbs, but in the process lost a fair amount of muscle due to a restrictive, extended ketogenic diet (I was also not meeting my daily calorie goals). That’s when I decided to turn to science and strategy, and was also introduced to T-Nation and Dr. Brett Contreras. *Seriously, if you haven’t heard of this guy, you should probably check him out.* 2017 began with a week solely dedicated to light weight and harboring mind-muscle connection through a variety of isolation and unilateral moves. Calories were raised to 2,000 and carbs were raised as well (which made me nervous, having had PCOS as we are always preached to about low-carb this, low-carb that). Once I had the ability to easily activate each target muscle upon mental command, I began the split I’m still currently using today, essentially starting over from “scratch” with light weight, only allowing for progressive overload once I could move through working reps with the added weight while feeling that burning, sickly satisfying activation through the full ROM. This method subsequently put inches on my glutes while carving inches from my waist in 2017 alone.  —————————————————————————— Currently, here’s what my workout splits and nutrition stats look like: **MEASURES:** * 2010, 100 lbs (approximate): B 32”, W 26”, H 33-34” * 2015, 140 lbs: B 35”, W 28”, H 39” * Current, 125 lbs (obviously have had a B.A.): B 37”, W 24”, H 37” *Body composition has changed ENTIRELY since 2010 - I weigh 25 lbs more but am actually leaner and curvier than I ever have been. I can fit into clothes from high school, but due to muscle development things are tight in the gluteal and thigh area.  **NUTRITION:** *Currently minimal macro tracking (I do track protein daily) and eating intuitively to gain / maintain muscle. This will change soon for the wedding cut.   1,800 - 2,000 calories  P: 150g MINIMUM - I always track to ensure I meet this goal daily C: 160 - 200g - I’m cognizant of this as well so as to not overdo it or choose poor carb sources  F: 60 - 70g  **WORKOUTS:** *xx = superset* *Please note that I don’t religiously count reps, I instead choose to focus on how my mind-muscle connection is that day and will adjust my workout and set range accordingly. If, for example, I’ve had adequate sleep and a good pre-workout meal, activation will be at 100% and I can focus on progressive overload and push my limits that day with weight. If not, I’ll put more focus on warming up the target muscle until it can be activated, even if it does require 15 minutes. On those poor activation days, I focus more on high volume and moderate weight to further promote muscle activation, doing 10x10s, etc.   **M, W, S - GLUTES / HAMSTRINGS** *Hip Thrusts are incorporated *every* leg day, this is and should always be the biggest staple move in anyone’s arsenal for glute development *(Dr. Contreras’ article: https://bretcontreras.com/hip-thrust-wiki-page/)* *Warmup (with medium miniband)...* Frog pumps, banded lateral walks, glute bridges, banded kickbacks, elevated single-leg hip thrusts, banded clamshells I warm up until I feel adequate activation and blood flowing, sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes 15.  *Working Sets...* * Barbell Hip Thrusts xx Seated Banded Abductors (heavy to x-heavy miniband) *5 sets til failure or 10x10 depending on activation, weight is subjective - Personal Range of 45 lbs to 250 lbs depending on the day* * Glute-focused Leg Press w/ pulses at full extension  *5 sets til failure, ending with your heaviest working weight, Personal Range of 90 lbs to 350 lbs through working set* * Box-Squats with pause at the start of concentric motion - I feel that these target glutes more than traditional squats. *Personal Range of 95 to 155 lbs*   * Romanian / Sumo Deadlifts with barbell or cable xx Cable Pull-throughs *Deadlift: 45 - 180 lbs* *Pull-throughs: 20 - 70 lbs (this one is tricky and you’ll stumble back if you try too much weight)* * Plated “Back” Extensions xx Dumbbell Romanian Deads  *I hold a 10, 25, & 45 lb plate and angle my toes out on the platform, hunching my back over and curling into myself as I bring myself back up from the extension, pulling completely with my glutes.* *DB Deads: 15-45 lb DBs, limited range of motion to keep tension tight* * Goblet Squats *Kettlebell or DB, wide stance. Personally bounce between 20 and 65 lb DBs. More focus on slow concentric and eccentric movement with pause at bottom of squat* * Hamstring Curls w/ dumbbell or machine * Heavy Kettlebell Swings xx Weighted Step-ups **T, R - BIS, TRIS, DELTS, LATS, ABS &amp; HIIT** *I keep this pretty basic as my upper body gains are quick to show and thus don’t require much overload, so I just kill it all in a single session. I also prefer having a bit less muscle on my upper half so this isn’t a point of focus and strategy for me.  * Hammer curls, drag-curls, cable curls * Chin-ups and wide-grip pullups * Lateral raise, shoulder press, rear delt raise, front plate raise, dumbbell lateral raise to overhead raise  * Tricep pushdown, skullcrushers, dips * Seated / kneeling lat pulldown, barbell or cable rows, straight-arm cable pushdown w/ straight bar * Weighted (light) cable crunches w/ rope attachment, dragonflies (KILLER), oblique extensions, hanging leg raises, etc.  HIIT: 1.5 minutes at lvl 5 followed by 30 seconds at lvl 20 for 15 to 20 minutes. I do this twice a week as HIIT is very taxing on the body.  —————————————————————————— What I found most interesting is the almost dominant role mind-muscle connection played in busting through my plateau and gaining inches where desired.  I’m interested in hearing whether anyone else has had a similar experience by choosing to focus on mind -muscle connection over simply counting reps and pushing weight?

7n8xff,"This post is intended to be a simple list of what I think are the most important items for intermediate or new swimmers, based on all the questions we get on [Swimmit](http://reddit.com/r/swimming) and my own experience of what I've been asked over the years. Swimming is a sport that when done consistently will allow you to pursue it for an entire lifetime and reward you for doing do.  For those of you who do decide to take it up, we'll look forward to seeing you in the water, whether pool, river, lake or ocean. /r/swimming is a good resource, especially if you use the search bar, as there is no question that hasn't been asked and gotten an answer previously.   ********************** 1 **Keep swimming** This is the most important lesson of any exercise or change program. You  have to keep doing it consistently. You will feel rubbish at the beginning, struggling to breathe & will continue to feel so for a few weeks. But by your fifth or sixth week, you will feel far better.  Understand that the real victory comes on the crappy Thursday evening after a long day at work, when you could give up, but instead you make yourself go for a swim instead. Sure, you can swim half what you usually do. I'll bet you that once you actually go swimming, you'll start to feel better, and do more. A year of crappy Thursday nights though, when all added together, will wipe the memory of each and every one of them away. Skill and talent at swimming are less essential than consistency and work. Those older swimmers who seem to swim so effortlessly? That's not because of a talent or special training you didn't get, *it's because they keep swimming*. 2 **Swim three times a week** At least. People ask us this question. We give them this answer. They don't like the answer.  They give up because it's too much. Self-perpetuating problem.  Here's the real story: Three times a week isn't that much since swimming is technically difficult. I usually say the minimum required is four times a week. But if you are getting started, commit to three days a week, of at least 45 minutes per time. Look, let's be honest here. Swimming is technically difficult to become proficient at. If your only goal is some weight loss, eat less, go for a walk every day. That will work. If you would like to do those *and* develop a skill that will last you the rest of your life, you need to start swimming regularly. Swimming will  become part of your life, and for that to happen, you will have to fall a little in love with it, with the fluid expression of grace in the water, or the sound of your exhalation underwater,  or the meditative aspect of developing skill and mastery.  *Triathletes*: I still telling you people at least four times a week, and I've heard all your excuses. 3 **Get a proper swimsuit and goggles** If you let something as simple as wearing a tight swimsuit be a constraint to keeping swimming, stop now, and let's not waste any more time. Anything loose causes drag,  which will make your swimming harder, and make you less likely to improve. Wearing baggy suits or board short is NOT like running with weights, it will not benefit endurance or strength. It will simply make your swimming worse. We've seen more almost naked people of every shape that most people who aren't a paid professional of some kind. No-one cares what I or you look like.  I understand you might be a bit self-conscious or shy. That's your first challenge. Over-come that, fake it until you don't care, and you are on your way. And don't even think about being a regular swimmer without goggles. They are the [most important invention in the history of swimming](https://loneswimmer.com/2013/07/01/the-history-of-swimming-goggles/), including any of the modern strokes. Edit: Since none of the apparel companies or even many swimmers understand the differences in goggles I wrote an article a few years ago explaining [the main different types of goggles and how to choose among them](https://loneswimmer.com/2015/02/04/how-to-understand-and-choose-between-the-different-types-of-swimming-googles/). 4 **Don't eat (an hour) before swimming** It's an old wife's tale about eating an hour before swimming will cause cramps. What it will do is start your body digesting food, and making you feel lethargic during your swim as less blood is available for exercise. Also, contrary to what almost everyone you know will tell you, you do not need to eat before exercise. If you have a normal diet, you are carrying about two and half thousand calories in glycogen in your blood and liver. That's enough for **TWO HOURS** of intensive exercise. Endurance swimmers like myself and other endurance athletes actually rely on this ability to perform at their sport. 5 **Don't eat immediately after swimming** The single most important reason that swimming is often poor for weight control is that since water is colder (even a heated pool) than body temperature, it stimulates an increase in metabolism in an attempt to increase core temperature. This drives an increase in appetite and people eating too much. You are not hungry from the exercise of swimming (for beginners), you are hungry from *thermogenesis*, the internal metabolic production of heat. Teach yourself to ignore it. maybe drink some milk at the start untiul you are used to it. 6 **Breathe out underwater** If swimming has a secret, it's this. You have no idea [how many times we get asked on Swimmit about breathing difficulties](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/search?q=breathing&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). A common  phrase I hear is ""I'm a good swimmer, I just have difficulty with the breathing"", whereas those two are mutually exclusive. One simple search will provide thousands of instances of this question (Please, people, is using the search box so difficult?). Exhale with your face underwater. Try and do it in a controlled fashion rather than a sudden explosive breath. Keep doing that. Here's an actual trick to help: Hum. If you hum while your face is underwater it will help control your breathing and exhalation.  7 **Get some technique advice** You'll notice how little of the above has to do with actually swimming. This bit is about swimming. If you are the kind of person who can stay at something because it's difficult to master, swimming is perfect for you. I could say get lessons, but all you really need is someone who knows about swimming technique (a good swimmer, maybe a lifeguard, maybe not) to look at what you are doing, and then make changes according to what they tell you. You cannot figure this out for yourself. I am always happy to help someone who might ask. Other experienced swimmers are the same, because we all got here the same way, with the help of others watching us, telling us what we are doing wrong.Lessons or coaching are great, but I don't like spending your money for you, and you can improve this way. You improve by finding out what part most needs to get better, then doing drills to correct that. Beginners hate drills because they feel slow and often unproductive. So they don't do drills. Which is why some people can actually swim for 10 (or in the case of one guy in my pool|) 20 years, and never improve.  Here are a couple of the best drills for front crawl (aka freestyle). I'm not involved in any of these videos, I simply did a YouTube search 1. [Side drills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5RqScQWpko). Slow, boring, but the most important drill of all. These help with balance, rotation and the all-important breathing. You start this with your arms by your side or one extended in front. Do a couple of lengths of each. Then start to add a rotation and one arm pull . Eventually move to doing a rotation and pull every 12 kick strokes 2. [Raise your legs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIH7mS-GHUo). Wall kicks are really good. Legs too low in the water are the second biggest problem after inability to breathe. The main causes are lifting your head too much, poor ankle flexibility and bicycle kicking from your knees instead of hips. I'm going to give you another easy tip: Clench your butt cheeks together.  This will reduce your ability to kick your lower legs, and will start to raise your body to be more horizontal. 3. [Fist drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul3yH2tzwAU). This is a stable of most experienced swimmers' toolbox. It's difficult, frustrating, slow, feels horrible ...and immensely valuable. Swim some lengths of front crawl with your hands in fists instead of open, then go back to swimming normally. It will have all kinds of positive effects, mainly you will start to use your forearms for propulsion which will improve your position, and reduce drag. (Yes, you will be fisting the water).  There are hundred of drills covering all aspects of your stroke. Try to spend the first ten minutes of every swim doing these above, and add/substitute some more depending on what feedback you have on your stroke.   8 **Understand lane etiquette** [Following basic lane etiquette](https://loneswimmer.com/2011/02/15/lane-swimming-etiquette/) is the swimming equivalent of putting the weight backs on the racks and wiping down the bench after you use it or putting the flag back in the little hole, or so I understand from Fittit. (*I don't even lift, bro*). Swimmers like other swimmers. If you understand and follow etiquette, which lifeguards and pool management don't in general understand, you can swim in a lane with people of differing speeds and do so comfortably for everyone. 9 **Use the clock** A very common mistake for new swimmers is mixing up  shortness of breath with exertion. People take rests that are far too long. The primary [use of the pace clock for new swimmers](https://loneswimmer.com/2015/05/13/how-to-an-introduction-to-the-pace-clock-for-beginner-improving-swimmers/) in most pools is not purely to time fast swims but to ensure you are swimming on a consistent interval. So you can use it to time your rests. For most people for most swims, rest shouldn't be longer than 30 seconds, and better to only take 20. 10 **Warming up is more important & difficult than you realise** Unlike the way say movies portray effort, humans require a period of increasing physical load to enable our hearts to beat faster and provide more oxygen to sustain more effort. The warming up phase has us feeling sluggish and unfit, until our hearts can beat enough to provide the necessary oxygen. Once warmed up, you will swim harder, faster and better. Don't make the mistake of thinking that how you feel in the first five or ten minutes is all your are capable of, which is a very common mistake that often stops people not familiar with physical exercise. Warming up is difficult in water for people struggling with breathing. ****************** BTW, have fun. You can start whenever, and if you want to swim the English Channel, I estimate you can attempt it in a mere 3 to 5 years, depending on whether you can swim at all right now.  My own speciality is distance open water swimming, and [my own blog on the subject is the world most popular](https://loneswimmer.com/how-to-articles-index/), if you fancy dropping by. (It's not financial, I make no money from any of this, I just love open water swimming).","The suit is a life-changer.  Going from the baggy swim trunks to the spandex shorts made me feel like I was part of the water, not an interloper.   And my swim level is ""can be trusted to not drown, but we'll still keep a bit of an eye on him"" ",703
7nrqkz,"**[M, 39, SW: 407.8lbs, Weight Before Skin Surgery: 194lbs, CW 199.2lbs]** EDIT: Im 6'2"", I realized I didn't have that in here. This will be my final post on this unless something major happens in the future. Once again, I want to thank /r/Fitness  for all the support you've given me this past year, I truly appreciate it and hope I can repay it in kind. **Just-Show-me-the-Photos...** [Before/After Photos](https://imgur.com/a/jnLz1)  **TL;DWTR (aka I've got a minute, give me the juicy details):** So, it has been 1 year since I hit my 200lbs loss, ~9 months since I got below 200lbs for the first time in my adult life, and just over 6 months since I underwent skin removal surgery where the removed ~244 sq inches of skin. To make it short, it has been one crazy year. This post is both an update for all of the above, plus an update on my diet/exercise plan (as per the rules). The surgery went well, but as you can see from the photos I'm kind of lopsided. My right side did not turn out as well as my left. As far as weight, I have maintained my 200lbs weight loss throughout the entire surgery, recovery and now as I work to regain what strength/muscle I lost. Below is a VERY abbreviated backstory, the original is still [available here](https://ap.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5lioa6/m3862_4078_2072_200lbs_weight_loss/) and the second [update is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5wpxhb/update_goal_reached_m3862_4078_1996lbs_2082lbs/) ​ ***************************************** ***************************************** **Quick Background:** I won't rehash the whole story again as the original posts from last year are still available, links below.  ​When I was a kid I was told I would never be fat. By the time I graduated from High School I was ~320lbs. Starting my Junior year of college I moved to main campus, weighing about 390, and reached 400+ by end of the 1st year on campus. Second year on campus was when I reached my recorded max of 407.8lbs. It is likely that I weighed more, but the 407.8 figure is the highest I found logged by a medical office, so it is the one I use.  ***************************************** ***************************************** **Diet:**  For the 2 years I have stuck to IIFYM, which is, in my humble opinion, the best out of the options I've personally tried. Approximately, 1800-1900 cals/day cutting. After the surgery I was told I had to eat, so I reverse dieted to 2000 to aid recovery. But this translated into ""eat all the foods"" since I didn't really have anything else to do. This did put some fat back on me since all I could do was sit and walk short distances. But I did maintain the 200lbs loss for a year now and have never crossed back into that. I shoot for 130g of food-based protein, minimum, regardless of diet or supplementation. Even on cheat days. But I usually get more like 180g a day. Fat is usually under 45g/day, carbs make up the rest. Typical Meals: * **Breakfast:** 60g Oatmeal sweetened w/ Splenda, 4 piece of toast from Heiner's 35 calorie bread * **Pre-Workout:** Large Apple * **Lunch:** 8oz chicken breast, 250g sweet potato. * **Protein Bar** Rarely, but I prefer ones that don't go under a 10cal:1g protein ratio. (eg. 200cal bar w/ 20g protein) * **Dinner:** 6-8oz Lean meat, veggies, and I end the day's eating @ 6-7pm with a single serving protein pancake w/ SF syrup. Kodiak Dark Chocolate is hands down the best IMO. I don't personally believe in supplementation. Just a personal thing. But, I will drink some Myprotein-brand BCAAs after a particularly difficult workout, but nothing else. I do occasionally use protein powder, but it is usually to cook with, not drink, and when I do get some it is usually Myprotein or ON brand. ***************************************** ***************************************** **Exercise:**  My approach to fitness, given my age, is functional with a heavy slant on looking decent. I would like to have abs just one time in my life, just to look like the classic ""male."" However, over the last few weeks I have realized that I just wasn't putting my all into it. I realize that, technically, I am still recovering from a massive surgery where the front of my body was split in twain. But, I never get sore anymore, I rarely mix up my exercises. I didn't add in new ones. I did a strict split and just tried to put up more weight. I told myself that *insert exercises I was good at* exercises is what I could do due to *insert BS excuse here* and never pushed forward. Then I met a good friend of mine, who is 18 years old. 21 years my junior, a local soccer star, cross country State finalist, and still hits the gym everyday. He pushes me harder than anyone I have ever met, refuses the ""nonsense"" of my age until I have actually tried something new. It reminds me of my niece who always says ""I don't like that"" when you offer something new to eat. For me it's ""Im too old/weak/recovering for that."" He doesn't accept that until I have tried. If I could give any tip to someone new to this fitness/weight loss world it would be to find someone who doesn't take excuses. Not because you are paying them, but because they honestly know you well enough to see past the excuses, to see the person you could be. Over the last few weeks I have been fine tuning a new program, it is still in progress but this is pretty close to the final plan. The idea was to move away from a regular split to something that mimicked a 2 day/wk split while making it accessible for someone who doesn't have the recovery ability of a 20 year old. Plus, adding in more functional movements and core to each day versus a dedicated day. **Each day is a Heavy/Light split, the Heavy area being the main focus of the day and the Light being a secondary day, but no reduction in weight, just a reduced number of exercises.**  **Split:** I don't have a set rep/set pattern for any exercise other than **10 reps for the first 2 sets of any exercise, then all additional sets are to failure.** Average range of sets is 4-8, depending on the exercise, weight, etc. * **Monday** is Heavy Chest / Light Back + Chinups, Pushups, 3x Core Exercises  * **Tuesday** is Heavy Core / Light Legs + Pushups, Chinups, 2x Bicep Exercises * **Weds** is Heavy Back / Light Chest +  Pushups, Vacuums, 2x Core Exercises  * **Thursday** is Deadlifts, Rackpulls, Pullovers, Pushups, 3x Core Exercises, Chinups * **Friday** is Heavy Shoulders / Light Arms + Pushups, Asst. Pullups, 3x Core exercises  * **Sat** is Heavy Legs (focused) then Light Full Body (more or less I workout various things, all to failure, while I chat and enjoy the day) + Iso Bicep Exercises * **Sun** is Rest Day **Breakdown of Exercises:** * **Chest:** Chest Press (Machine), Landmine Press, Sven Press, Flat Bench, Incline Bench * **Back:** Machine Rows, Lat Pulldown, T-bar Row, Iso Low-Row, Cable Mid-Row, Lat Pressdown, Australian Pullups, DB Shrugs, I/T/Y/Ws, DB Rows, Lumbar Hyperextensions, Robbery Exercise w/ 20lb DBs * **Core:** Core Twist, Flutter Kicks, Reverse Crunches, Oblique Crunches, V holds, V Ball Passes, Ab-Pullovers, Hanging Leg Lift, L-Sit, Roman Chair Crunches * **Legs:** High Bar Squat, Goblet Squat, Air Squat, Barbell Calf Press, Leg Extensions, Glute Kickback Machine, Hamstring Curls, Glute Thrusts, Abd/Add Press, Leg Press * **Shoulders:** DB Scap Holds, Dislocations, DB OHP, BB OHP, Lateral Raises, Plate Raises, Plate Steering (use a plate like a steering wheel) * **Bicep/Tricep:** Standing DB Curl, Preacher Curls, Iso DB Curls, Cable Curls, Drag Curls, Hammer Curls, Tricep Pushdown, Tricep Cable Extension, Internal/External Rotator Cuff Cable Pulls Again, these are all the same format. **10 reps for 2 sets, then everything else to failure with no hard set range.** Average is 4-8 sets, depends on exercise, weight, etc. Deadlifts are the odd man out, it is 5 reps each set, no set limits, just until I can't do it anymore or form breaks down. Usually it's 6-10 sets depending on weight progression. The Mods asked me to elaborate on the weight progression of my fitness plan. Given my age I'm not really chasing the same dreams that the younger people are so my progression is more tailored to overall fitness. When I start a new exercise I find a weight that I can do 4-6 sets with, to failure each set, and that is where I start. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, some days as I start increasing the weight through the sets I get worn out and don't progress in weight that week. My goal is to push to failure each and every time. Overall I feel this gives a better workout for me and seems to still allow decent recovery. As an example, I logged my previous deadlift day. * **Set 1:** 95lbs x 21 reps * **Set 2:** 115lbs x 17reps * **Set 3:** 135lbs x 13reps * **Set 4:** 185lbs x 10reps * **Set 5:** 205lbs x 6 reps * **Set 6:** 235lbs x 4 reps * **Set 7:** 235lbs x 3 reps I do log my workouts, but I don't track # of reps. I only track that I did a set to failure, how many sets I did total, and the maximum weight used. This is done by putting an X or a dot next to exercise which denotes a completed set. Then at the end I write down the maximum weight used across the exercise. **Cardio:**  I have slowly added in either **sprint cardio** (Sprints on the Treadmill Usually) or some **long slow cardio** (Stair Climber is still my favorite). I do this **3-4 days a week and I do at least 2x 2-minute Sprints every day but Saturday.** I also do rehab-given exercises for shoulders, knees, and back to maintain the health of those areas. Those are just peppered in throughout the week. I won't list these here, **if you have an injury, see a doctor/physio.** Yes, it is a lot each day. But I tend to thrive on a meticulously laid out plans. Plus, if I over-shoot in the plan, then Ill either overachieve daily or at least hit the mark in execution. I've only been lifting heavy again for about 2.5 months between the surgery and my shoulder. So these are my horribly weak, Post Recovery Lifts (these are for reps of 3 of more, not 1RM) * **Flat bench:** 155lbs * **Squat:** 155lbs * **Deadlift:** 235lbs **Extras:** I like to hike/backpack, swim for distance, and I run on the rare occasion, but aside from the gym I don't do much in the way of sports. ***************************************** ***************************************** ​**Whats Next:** You can stamp a big ""VAIN"" on my forehead, but I want freaking abs. Just once. Also traps. My gym mates and I just finished a 6 week ""Add-On"" plan I developed where we did vacuums and pushups every morning. I went from barely being able to do 15 pushups to easily being able to bust out 40-45 in one go. Everyone whined about the vacuums after the first 3 days, but now they are thanking me, it really is an undervalued exercise. Now that is done, I am planning to focus on my posture and my shoulders. I have some kyphosis in the upper back from years of being a computer geek then later a WoW nerd. So, I want to correct my posture as much as I can, which will translate into better, stronger shoulders. I am also going to have to try and figure out how to get the other 1 or 2 skin removals I will need to look ""normal"". My rear flanks/love-handle area will absolutely need fixed and my chest will likely need to be fixed. Until that point, I will continue to lose fat and get as functionally strong as I can get. ***************************************** ***************************************** **FAQ** * Are you going to lose any more weight? >My plastic surgeon has recommended I go down to 185, but no lower. At that point I should be focused on more of a recomp. As you can see from the pictures, there is still fat under the skin. I need to get rid of as much of that as I can. * Did you have surgery or use any drugs/medicine/chemicals? >​No. Nothing against them, I just feel the ""quick"" (but, clearly not painless) methods available lack a certain educational value to them. Sure, I can teach someone the techniques to keep off the 100lbs they lost from weight loss surgery, but actually living it for years, dealing with failures/obstacles, is nearly always the best teacher. * What's next? >I'd still like to climb a mountain. Maybe Mt. Rainier or Mt. Elbert?​ Something with proper snow and requires a bit of technical climbing.​ I'v​e ​always been a bit of an armchair mountaineer. A friend of mine climbed Kilimanjaro about a year after a dual cervical fusion, plus he is 12 years older than me, so what is and isn't possible for me kind of has been thrown out the window. * Did you ever consider suicide? >I put this on every update I do, or anything I post connected with weight loss. The answer is yes I have, on a few occasions, not my finest moments. **If you are considering suicide, PLEASE get help, there are lots of options for help, regardless of where you are in the world. You might think suicide will stop what you are currently feeling, but it also robs you of everything you could be. In the US you can call 1-800-273-8255, 911, or go to the nearest Emergency Room.

I try to get 100g of protein minimum, but my main focus has always been calories. During my bulk, I just ensured that I was eating 500 calories above my TDEE. By the time I got to my cut, I had some idea of how my body reacted to the amount of food I ate, so I was eating around 1200-1500 calories.      ***Bulking***      /r/gainit helped a lot on my initial bulk. I used a BMR calculator which showed that my maintenance was around 2400 cals. I started at 500 above that, but this escalated as I wanted get as big as possible. This was also partly because I was watching Rich Piana's ""Bigger By The Day"", the best YouTube series of all time (RIP Rich). My diet was something like this, with snacks in between.      *Breakfast* - Peanut butter on toast. All milk tea. Banana   *Lunch*      - Sandwich, nature valley bar, crisps.   *2nd Lunch* - This was maybe once or twice a week, but more often towards the end of my bulk. Usually sushi   *Dinner*     - Varied, living at home and eating whatever my parents make. Usually around 600-1000 calories   *Evening Meal* - Tuna or egg mayo sandwich, protein shake (2 scoops whey, 500ml milk)      ***Cutting***      Cutting for the most part was not difficult for me as i've always been skinny and am used to eating small amounts of food. I ate less, added 20-60 mins cardio around 3 times a week, and started cycling more often. I still ate snacks, but less often during the last couple of months of my cut to lose the last few lbs.      *Breakfast* - All milk tea   *Lunch*      - None. Maybe a banana before working out   *Dinner*     - Varied. Same as with bulking, I'm living at home and eat whatever my parents make. Usually 600-1000 calories.   *Evening*   - 100g Low-Fat Cottage Cheese. Protein shake (2 scoops whey, 250ml semi-skimmed milk, 250ml water)      Currently doing a slow, clean bulk. My diet's similar to cutting, but for breakfast i'm having scrambled eggs and toast. Going to slowly add more calories and plan on adding maybe 1-2kg of body weight a month.      **Exercise**      I started with Stronglifts 5x5 for the first 6 months, and I honestly wouldn't recommend it unless you just want to squat every workout, because I hated that shit. I got big legs with a lagging upper body, and my less than stellar form on squats, combined with regularly increasing loads, made my pre-existing knee issue worse, causing me to regularly take months off from squatting.    Since mid 2015 i've been running this split around 4-5 days a week. The only part I follow every workout is the heavy compounds at the start. I switch around some exercises depending on what I feel like doing that day, and what equipment is available.

In the 3 years i've been lifting, i've seen people make progress that made mine look shit, and others that haven't made any progress, mainly due to consistency.      I'm never going on a dreamer bulk again. I made some strength gains, but in no way did they justify the amount of fat I gained. I could've made those gains without putting that much weight on, and it would have made cutting easier. Currently doing a clean bulk with a goal of 1-2kg gains a month. Also, joint pains will get better or go away if you take some time off or stop doing exercises that aggravate them. I used to fight through them and it only made things worse.

7twg27,"https://imgur.com/gallery/8aHbH  https://imgur.com/gallery/8aHbH https://imgur.com/gallery/8aHbH Here are the photos in order - Photos always go first, right? I do have an Instagram (**@alwaysbulking42**) if you want to follow! So how did I do it? Let's go down each transformation. > 267lbs to 167lbs in Two Years So in 8th grade I was 267lbs and pretty damn disgusted by myself. I was playing basketball but I would break into a sweat in no time. I had tried diets that my parents put me on before, and I couldn't stick with anything. Finally, my aunt went on a low carb-like diet and lost 10lbs in the first week (mind you - I was 13 at the time - I figured this was REAL weight lost, not water weight), and 12lbs in the first two weeks total.  I figured hey, I could do this. The diet itself was not an Atkins style diet - it actually required lean meats as well, you couldn't eat bacon, or fatty hamburger meat, or fatty fish. My general weekly diet was unlimited amounts of lean protein week 1, then week 2 unlimited amounts of lean protein and non-starchy carbs (think tomatoes, zucchini, cucumber, lettuce, etc).  You alternated that until you hit your weight loss goal, then you slowly brought carbs and all the other foods back in that you weren't eating to get used to including them in your diet once more. I lost 100lbs doing this and it was pretty simple. The book itself was in French, and my parents read the entire thing front to back, translated the rules for me, and helped me learn to cook for myself so I could make sure I stuck with it even if they were away for work (and that I am truly appreciative of). I did not really work out - actually, the summer between 8th grade and highschool I had a physical labor job picking horse manure out of stalls all summer which probably helped me lose weight. There was no secret sauce here - it was all diet. > 167 to 220 in 4 years Here it was a bit different. I played sports year round in highschool and put size on because of that. I was eating a normal diet (aka back to carbs etc) but I wasn't strict on anything aside from just avoiding junk food. By senior year of high school I was close to 200lbs and pretty lean (not amazingly lean, definitely fatter than my 220lb college picture, but not in bad shape considering I never lifted). Note - I would KILL for those teenager hormones again. You look at weights and put size on :( In college I started lifting finally at the end of Freshman year. I got into the idea of powerlifting, then did nothing during the summer (working instead), and got back to college and lifted again. My programming for two years was a simple progressive loading 5x5. I would do 3x a week, and did C25K 3x a week, for 6 days total. If I knew it would be a short week, I threw C25K in after my 5x5 day * 5x5 Breakdown Not that it needs MUCH explanation, but I did 5x5 in a pretty straightforward manner: **DAY A** Squat Bench ChinUps **Day B** Deadlift Overhead Press Barbell Row For Squat and Deadlift I started at 135lbs and added 10lbs each time I succeeded, and upper body lifts I started with the bar and added 5 (10 for the bench until I broke 135). Pullups I needed to do assisted pullups and used all sorts of variants. I lifted 3x a week, alternating Day A and Day B. After two years I competed in a powerlifting meet and pulled a 501lb Deadlift, a 267lb bench with a pause, and a 365lb squat or so (I had an issue with my hip that flared up every now and then and limited my squat training) > 220 to Football Size (walked on at 265, final playing weight at 285) I decided to try out for my school's D1-AA football team in May, as a Junior, entering my senior year. I was sitting at 230lbs, and figured if I was strong and fast enough I would have a chance. I worked my ass off doing 2-a-days, basically continuing my 5x5 programming 2x a week and doing oly lifts the 3rd day. I was eating around 3500-4000 calories a day and gaining weight very fast (it wasn't until recently that my TDEE has finally started to make sense). I was doing a lot of plyometrics training, running, battle rope, medicine ball swings, running routes/receiver drills, LB drills of all sorts, running 40s, and a whole bunch of other crap. I ended the summer at 265 and in pretty decent shape for that weight, and asked the coach for a shot. He laughed at me, said ""this is a D1-AA team, you think you can walk on with 0 football experience?"" which made me laugh and I said ""Well, I hope to!"" I ended up running some decent 40s (all were under 4.75s during the summer), and they gave me a shot. Only issue was we had about 12 linebackers and they slotted me into Nose and I needed to gain weight (more mass is good in Football!).  For this stage I followed our Strength Coach's programming. That was a lot of ""safer"" lifts than what I was doing - power cleans, DB snatches, trap bar deadlifts, squats, etc. but not as much pure deadlifting and 1RMs. It definitely worked - I got waaaay stronger, and pulled a trap bar 555lb Deadlift for 3. During this time my squat went up to 445, normal deadlift was 565, and bench was 355 touch and go. > 298 and Fat So after football ended I immediately started losing weight. I was actually down to 275, down about 20lbs from my heaviest weigh in. I graduated college, stoked about my new job that I was starting that August, and slowly trailed down to 265. In August, I got news that my position was closed and they could no longer higher me due to policy reasons (it was at a Spanish bank; Spanish labor laws changed allegedly and they could only offer me a position if I was a 4 year undergrad student at a Spanish U).  Regardless, I started looking for another job and couldn't find one at all. They all asked the same question - why didn't I have a job out of college? Anyway, that threw me down into a spiral of self-loathing and I ballooned right back up to 298 at my peak (I might have been even heavier, I didn't want to weigh myself at times). I stayed at that weight for close to 2 years. The turning point for me was when I went to Cancun with a few friends, everyone was running around and I was working on keeping up, and then I looked down at myself and thought I was ridiculously fat and I couldn't do that. I said fuck this and started a Ketogenic diet again because for bulk weightloss I think it has to be the best thing out there. I did a different version than from when I was a kid; this time it had more fat (I learned about proteins taking you out of ketosis if you eat too much), and a diversified source of low-carb veggies. I got ketostix and went back to counting calories like I did in college. The weight was melting off, but I had no strength - I hadn't trained strength at all in college. I lost weight at a pretty astounding rate and in only a little over a year I lost 80lbs, from 298 to 216.7. My lifting routine was all light DB work and high levels of cardio and LISS. Nothing exciting - just getting in the gym to keep muscle mass as much as possible. My back was shot and my knees were aching so I didn't squat or deadlift much. > 216 to 230 Range https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5wr9w4/m2662_300lb220lbs_80lbs_lost_and_subsequent/ This can all be found here. I detailed it pretty extensively - I went back to powerlifting. I started off doing 5x5 then went to 3x5, then 3x3, and progressively worked on getting stronger. I actually got down to a 4.58s 40yd dash as well which was always a goal of mine (to get under 4.6). I now currently do 5/3/1 and added in First Set Last as a hypertrophy block. Diet is simple: I shoot for 200+g of protein (usually chicken thigh or strip steak), and fill in the rest. I get most of my sugary carbs around workout (sip one protein shake with half a scoop of highly branched cyclic dextrin during workout, and another right after), and the rest is vegetables and then a cookie or some other type of sweet treat after my main meal. I eat fewer than 3300 calories per day at the moment and am working on a slow slow cut (I'm a bit puffier than in the last photo) > Ending Thoughts I had a weird path throughout this time, but now I've gotten a lot more fit and learned a bunch along the way. It's not easy, but you have to hold *yourself* accountable for these changes. I had a low TDEE (measured out to be around 2800 calories working out 6x a week at 260lbs) and I still managed to cut weight. I am sitting at around a 3300 calorie per day TDEE currently at 230 and working out less than I was when losing weight Ultimately, the way a friend recently said it about her cut (as a bodybuilder) was ""I want this burger right now more than I want to be lean in 3 months"" and I realized I made that mental switch in my lifestyle choices. I wanted to be lean in a year more than I wanted that burger, or popeyes, or alcoholic drink right then. Truthfully, the real reason I even put all these photos together is because from August until about a month ago I was dreading going to the gym and hated it, but I used these photos as a reminder for why I needed to keep up my routine I've kept the weight off for nearly two years, and I honestly have to take it one week at a time to make sure I stay this weight if not lighter I don't talk much about diet at the moment on my Instagram but I have a powerlifting focused one :) **@alwaysbulking42** if you want to follow!",You look like a half dozen or so different people   ,1991

Athlean-X by Jeff Cavalier (I don't know why, he gets a lot of hate on this forum, but the guy is intelligent, doesn't spout BS, and knows his shit). He's more focused on the biomechanics/science of training, and less on nutrition. He also focuses more on hypertrophy, not so intense with strength training, but this is good for newbies. Jeff does have an angle because he sells workout programs and supplements, but you can still learn a ton from his free videos. 2. Omar Isuf: He has a great channel, very charismatic, and regularly features the most respected names in the industry (Eric Helms, Mike Isratel, Brad Schoenfeld, etc.). And for the most part, he's not trying to sell you anything. Omar is more into the strength-training side of the house but does get into muscle building and nutrition regularly. 3. Vitruvian Physique: Very funny dude, and lots of good info on his channel. He's almost exclusively focused on muscle-growth and cutting (aesthetics), but very good info on nutrition and the like.

7xjdq6,"Cardio is an aspect of fitness that is often completely neglected by new lifters due to the myth of ""cardio killing gains."" Other lifters understand the benefits of conditioning but exclusively prefer HIIT for their purposes. Greg Nuckols wrote a fantastic 2015 article titled [""Avoiding Cardio Could Be Holding You Back""](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/avoiding-cardio-could-be-holding-you-back/) where he makes a case for cardio for lifters and defends LISS.  Among his points are the following (Unless it's in quotes, I'm paraphrasing in my own words. Read the article): 1) When you test your strength and do 1 rep maxes, you are almost purely using your anaerobic system. But your aerobic system influences how hard you can train which is how you build that max strength.  2) ""For relatively short efforts (like a heavy set of 5) the aerobic system is producing almost a third of the energy needed, and for higher rep sets, it’s producing more than half the energy."" ""The implication: **The more powerful your aerobic energy system, the more reps you’ll be able to do with a given weight or percentage of your max, because every bit of energy you can produce aerobically is that much less that you have to produce anaerobically, which pushes off those factors that cause acute muscular fatigue.** Also, if you do the same number of reps with a given amount of weight, less of the energetic contribution will come from your anaerobic energy systems, so the set will be less fatiguing. So **you’re either looking at more work and the same fatigue, or the same amount of work with less fatigue; either way, you win.**"" 3) ""Better aerobic conditioning means you’ll recover faster between sets (and since you’ll be somewhat less reliant on your anaerobic system for each set, they’ll be less fatiguing in the first place) so you can handle higher total training volume."" 4) Aerobic exercise encourages your body to be in a stronger state of recovery between exercise sessions.  5) HIIT is great and has its place in training. HIIT is time-effective, improves aerobic capacity, AND improves your anaerobic capacity more than LISS. It preps you for max effort exertion in ways that LISS cannot. However, HIIT is very intense when it is done properly and the necessary recovery is more likely to interfere with strength training. LISS is not as likely to interfere and still gives all the benefits that Nuckols discussed. It's easier to fit on any day in a programming routine. There's a lot more in the Nuckols article that I did not include in the bullet points. Check it out. ",Fantastic article.  Everyone avoids cardio and conditioning because it's hard.,1112

M/ 35/ 5'8""/ 154lbs (177cm/70kg).   i was that kid that never plays any sports in the yard, then no sports in the school (i even had a special certificate for that, even not having any health problems), and then same kind of certificate at the university. and i thought that was okay, why bother.  soon i turned into the *before* person, not even noticing that. life was good. i guess i would stay the same (or even worse), but one of my musical idols made a [drastic change](https://s00.yaplakal.com/pics/pics_original/0/0/9/523900.gif) and, to be honest, this was my stimulus. and i joined a gym!   i had no idea what to do at that time, personal trainers cost a fortune and i couldn't afford one so for ~year i was doing the pretty common *fsckarounditis*.   then, i found this subreddit (hurray!).   at that time the SS and GSLP were trendy on here, i picked [Phrak's](http://i.imgur.com/0uiw7qW.png) variant and was happy about it.   what i didn't realized back then is the *nutrition* part. thus, i completely failed *again* reaching my goal. even more, i was following some advice to start with a bulk to make a frame so i ended even in worse state. damn!   interesting enough things turned around after i got married (usually it's the oppositve, at least looking at my friends and relatives). in my case, i got lucky as my wife has a part time of personal trainer, so she knows her stuff. from this point things took a new turn (~10% bodyfat for the first time in my life, for example).   &nbsp; # Nutrition   This became the collar of my next chapter in life.   * calculated my cutting calories,   * my macros,   * changed the food i was eating,   * started skipping the breakfast,   * incorporated veggies and souces,   * diet cola (amazing stuff)   and things started to happen. i am tracking my intake at least 5 days a week. weekend a kinda hard to operate, because going out or, even more uncontrollable, visiting parents. because you just cannot say NO to your mother when it comes to food))  anyhow, these days i am trying to take only lean protein sources at home, thus leaving space for the carbs and fats i will get later out.   [weight loss for the last 3 months](https://i.imgur.com/Fjts5ja.jpg)   [daily macros](https://i.imgur.com/kwvpPXT.jpg) (175 protein, 195 carbs, 30 fat for a total of ~1700kcal)   &nbsp; # Training   I am a office worker and lucky enough that my work starts at ~11-12 in the morning, thus i am attending gym 5 times a week at ~930AM, when i'm driving to the office. i do enjoy this way better than 3 day at week. it soon became for me a usual daily routine.   get up, espresso, drive to gym, workout, drive to office, do your job.   regarding training i am working out in the *RPT* style   * starting with my heavy set in 4-6 range   * then -10% of load, doing an extra 1-2 reps,   * then -10% of load, doing an extra 1-2 reps, usually AMRAP.        when i can do 6 reps in the first set, i add weight and start at 4 reps and so on.   my routine looks like:   Monday: Chest/Abs (Incline BP)   Tuesday: Back/Calves (Deadlift)   Wednesday: Shoulders/Abs (Military Press)   Thursday: Legs/Calves (Squat)   Friday: Upper Body/Abs (Incline BP 8-10 reps)   &nbsp; # Pre- and Post-Workout meals Here pretty simple. if i train fasted (what i do 99% of the time), as pre workout there is caffeine (as one espresso and 100mg caffeine pill) and yohimbe + leucine.   post-workout 40g protein + 70g carbs in a shake (whey, milk 0%, a banana and oats).   &nbsp; # Supplements   interestingly, i thought at the beginning these are some kind of miracle and using them i can achieve it all faster.   tried:   * beta-alanine   * vitamin d3   * leucine   * bcaa   * citrulline malate   * betaine   * creatine   * spirulina   * omega 3   * yohimbe   * whey (read food, as it is food)      at the moment from this stack taking vitamin d3, creatine 5g a day, spirulina 3g a day, omega 3 (2g as omega itself), yohimbe 16mg + 5g leucine before fasted training.   &nbsp; # Cardio   when i reached ~14-15% bodyfat, the fatloss rate started stalling, i had two choices: cut calories more or add cardio.   i chose second, as 1700 is already pretty low, so on my rest days i am doing 20 minutes HIIT: 10 rounds of springs - 1 minute full speed, 1:30 minute at less speed.   fatloss went thru well with this.   &nbsp; # Preliminary Conclusions now that my cutting phase is over, what have i learnt:   1. chose a fatloss rate of ~1% of your bodyweigh a week, because it's managable and you less face cravings and such things   2. implement a *refeed* day. your current cutting calories * 30%. add carbs to this amount and try having fat at ~20-25g on this day. you may think it hinders your fatloss progress, but it's not.   3. implement diet breaks if your cutting lasts longer than 3 months. take a week at maintenence every 3 months of cutting. it will do you good.   4. have a deload training week every 8 weeks of heavy training. it's your usual routine, but at 50% of your working weights. give your body some rest. 5. don't engage in a diet that you know for sure you can't sustain in long term.  just eat *less*. the universal rule *calories in <  calories used* is working perfectly.      # Next Chapter   Now i am taking 2 weeks of maintenence (upping from 1700 to ~2000kcals/day), monitoring my weight and finding my real number and afterwards will engage in my first ever bulk, aiming for a 2-3lb/month weight gain, hoping most of this being muscle tissue.   &nbsp; see you when my bulk ends!

I created these two videos recently to improve upon the [r/bodyweightfitness Recommended Routine (""RR"")](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) and I'm sharing them here as well. The link is in the header and the summary is below them. ### 1. [Video: How to do Proper Pullups](https://youtu.be/P9knQsSe23o) * There are two phases of a pullup: The scapular pull in the beginning (with straight arms) and then the actual pullup.  This can be done in one fluid motion but if you take a video of yourself and find your shoulders remain shrugged up *or* if you can barely get the chin-over, you should consciously focus on improving your scapular pull. * Also, make sure you're **going down ALL THE WAY** and NOT doing half-ROM pullups which are *super* common. Another tip is to keep your feet uncrossed, thighs together and in front of you as it will make you stronger. ### 2. [Video: How to do pullups if you can't do any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLjb-iXpxWE) * In part two, I demonstrate how to **perform negative pullups properly,** emphasizing *the importance of lifting/tucking the knees up as you lower down so that your feet dont hit the ground before your arms are straight.* Your goal is to do 10-second negatives. * If you can't control the negative, then you need to work on your rows (incline rows to be exact) which are an easier pulling exercise and a prerequisite for pullups. In the RR, we recommend you get to 3 sets of 8 reps (""3x8"") of horizontal rows before moving to the pullup progression. * If you are unsure how or where to do rows, review the video on [bodyweight rows here](https://youtu.be/rloXYB8M3vU). I hope that helps! Please feel free to ask questions and leave feedback! ","I have been focusing on improving my pull-ups as of late, when I noticed I struggled to more than 5 (strict) properly. Following someone’s simple advice on the best way to get better at something is to do more of that thing, i decided to up my pull-up volume.   I am not a fan of doing nothing while resting at the gym so I have been doing little circuits of 2 minutes on the stair stepper hopping off and then banging out 5 quick pull ups. In 20 minutes you’ll bang out 50 pull ups and still get a good cardio/ heart rate up.

Needless to say I was ready for a change so after the new year I decided I was going to do finally do something. I went out and purchased a door frame chin up bar and started working out at home. My usual routine is; Pull-ups - 3X10 Hanging leg raises - 3X12 Chins-ups - 3X10 Hanging side crunches - 3X12 Decline push-ups 3x30 Crunches - 3X30 Followed by around 30mins on a stationary bike.  I usually manage to workout at least 4-5 times a week and try to eat healthy through the whole week except for my cheat day on Friday, and not gonna lie, I go hard on Fridays, haha. I've also started taking post-workout protein shakes which consist of approximately; 1 scoop of vanilla whey isolate, 1/2cup of strawberries, 1/2 cup of mixed berries, half a banana, and 1 cup of low calorie almond milk. I'm so grateful that I remembered to take pictures to map my progress! it's so awesome to be able to look back and see how far I've come, especially when half the time it feels like I'm not really making any progress at all.

Later that night, as I lay on my bed covered in a greasy sauce from the pound of Buffalo Chicken Cheese Fries I had just devoured, I took one last sip of my Green Tea Arizona and decided it was time for a change. I climbed down from my bunk bed and had my roommate take pictures of my sulking ass. The rest is history.  When I posted that progress picture to instagram, I got a flood of questions from my friends asking how they can do the same. Instead of answering the same question 100 times, I made a google drive folder with all the info they'd ever need: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y8MmU9NVxdFgeKU5cB-oM8TVUgnESCh4 **PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE MY POST FOR LACK OF INFORMATION, THE DRIVE HAS IT ALL** This includes my **diet plan, my routines**, and a quick rundown of my 2 year journey and what I learned about bodybuilding. Take note, I'm a very straightforward, no bs type of guy, so what I wrote in that 13 page manuscript is a hard, honest opinion on what I believe is necessary to seriously pursue bodybuilding. If you want to know how to truly start bodybuilding without wasting time sifting through Bro-Science, it's all in my ""How To Get Swole"" document. I also have a potty mouth, but that's something you're gonna have to deal with. With that being said: I was 18 years old and started at 121 lbs, 19% body fat. I only gained about 20lbs of lean body mass, which goes to show how much of a trial-and-error process this has been. I was in a weird grey area of body composition, being skinny fat. I was weak and fat, so I didn't know whether to bulk or cut first. I tried cutting first and that was a huge mistake. I then decided to bulk and focus on strength gains, and everything took off from there.  I started with Strong Lifts, going from benching the bar for 5x5 to benching a plate for 5x5. I did this for about a year until I could squat and deadlift 2 plates for 5x5.  My second year of training, I started incorporating accessory lifts. I made a Push Pull Leg style routine, putting shoulders on my leg day due to excessive fatigue on my push days. I did 2 days on one day off. I made the mistake of dirty bulking my first year, so I decided to start cutting. I counted calories and macros, and got to about 13% body fat before I gave up and blew right back up to 16%. I finally decided to start a serious cut, getting down to about 11% which took 5 months of strict dieting.  Now that I'm as lean as I've ever been, I plan on starting my very first lean bulk in preparation for my first bodybuilding competition. I have about a year and a half to train, so I plan to bulk until January 3rd, allowing myself about 16 weeks to cut before my show. I'm going to focus entirely on hypertrophy training. The routine is in the drive folder I posted earlier.",The most important bit of information I can take from your documents is pee is stored in the balls.,1006
85cna0,"On my weight loss journey, I have come to realize something. That even though the fat is coming off, the fat person inside me isn't. I'm still shy and introverted and self-conscious and clumsy.  I'm struggling to find all the things I thought I'd have. Like the improved self-confidence, the respect from people, being taken seriously and not being shrugged off as the fat guy.  How does one do this? Edit: oh. So this caught some steam in the time I played a couple overwatch matches. I'm going through all the comments folks. Thanks for your kind words.

85l7a4,"Hey /r/fitness, many of you may recognize my [keto diet results ](https://i.imgur.com/EMLrWih.jpg) that I've shared before, but it's another year and another cutting cycle down and I thought I'd update you all on my progress. After losing the 28 lbs you see in the previous picture, I spent the next 8 months in a maintenance/lean bulk phase. After regaining 12 lbs, in January I decided it was time to cut again. [Those pictures are here.](https://imgur.com/gallery/FPuPp) For this cut I decided not to use keto again, despite having great results with it last year. I made this decision mostly out of convenience, as my job requires me to be away all day and I often eat dinner in my car, so keeping meat or eggs in my car all day was not an option for me. I tracked calories meticulously and used a 2pm-8pm eating window (intermittent fasting) which I had great success with in the past. A day of eating would usually consist of 2 meals at about 1000 calories per meal. An example: Meal 1: 2 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a banana or two a Clif energy bar or oats Meal 2: Chicken and veggies (sometimes on tacos, sometimes not) 2 servings of protein powder 8 oz skim milk This usually would give me around 1900-2100 calories, with roughly 160-170g of protein. As for training, I followed [Wendler's 5/3/1 BBB variation](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101077382-boring-but-big). In December (before the cut) my lifts at a mock powerlifting meet were 375lb squat/205lb bench (kind of a fluke, though)/455 deadlift. I'd love to give you my list of excuses why my bench was so terrible, but I'll spare you and just say that in the gym I've hit a 240lb bench. My strength over the past year hasn't increased much, and that's due a lot to me dedicating a lot of energy into bouldering, which is a hobby I picked up shortly after my diet last year. Those sessions can leave my shoulders and back pretty tired, and my strength training has somewhat suffered from this, but I don't mind too much as I've become pretty happy with where my strength is at. Anyway, thanks for reading and I hope to keep you all updated with my future goals!",My mom does Keto and her results have been incredibly immediate. Do you have any suggestions on how to get started? ,590

Weight maintenance was defined as weight maintained within ±5% of baseline body mass index (BMI). We examined the role of various sociodemographic and lifestyle factors in successful weight maintenance. > > **Results:** Relatively few young adults were able to maintain their weight over ten years (28.6% of women vs. 23.0% of men); net weight loss was uncommon (7.5% and 3.8%). Most participants gained weight (mean annual weight gain was 0.9 kg in women and 1.0 kg in men). Among women, exercise was associated with successful weight maintenance, but having two or more children, frequent use of sweet drinks, irregular eating, history of dieting (intentional weight loss) and low life satisfaction were associated with weight gain. Among men, higher baseline BMI and higher education were associated with successful weight maintenance, whereas irregular eating, history of dieting and smoking were associated with weight gain. >  > **Conclusions:** Only about a quarter of young adults were able to resist weight gain. Regular eating and having no history of dieting were associated with successful weight maintenance in young women and men Quite an interesting study, though there are some methodological issues (~30% attrition rate, significant differences at follow up, self reporting questionnaires, diet and confounding factors like smoking weren't assessed at follow up to see how they changed) and the authors do state that average BMI is higher in Finland than elsewhere, and quite a lot of participants were overweight/obese at baseline.  I don't think their findings are particularly surprising, the two factors associated with weight gain in both men and women were irregular eating and a history of dieting. A history of dieting I can understand - probably reflects how people have difficulty controlling their intake and their disposition towards weight gain. Irregular eating is a bit more intriguing to me, so if anyone has more info on its association with weight gain it'd be helpful. Exercise was only significantly associated with weight maintenance in women, the association was non-significant but still positive in men. I recall other studies have shown that it's diet, rather than exercise, that contributes primarily to someones weight but it is nice to see that exercise does have its role in maintaining body weight.",I'm surprised that even 25% of people remained +-5% weight over 10 years. ,738
88mpr3,"The instructions say to bounce off your toes and then lower yourself. That means to hang like normal, supported by your feet, and kinda ""hop"" into a full pull-up position, right? And try to lower as slowly as possible? It says to lower for 5 seconds but I can only bear about 3. Will that really do anything over time? How often should I do it? It says recommended reps is ""6 for beginner"". Does that mean just do six? Or 6 and rest and do 6 more, or what? I can't imagine 6 of these a day does anything...

Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states ""you need to earn your carbs,"" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can. 2. **Sleep:** The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality.  3. **Programming:** I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. ""Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements."" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio. 4. **Food choice:** Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. ""Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to."" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily ([FodMap](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/)). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day. 5. **Warm-Up:** Stretching is apparently a waste of time, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: ""brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier."" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up. 6.  **Walking:** Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. ""Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients."" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results. 7. **Cardio:** Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth *and* fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen. 8. **Build the Backside:** If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press. 9. **Salt:** Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium. 10. **Post-workout drink:**  Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption.","Oh great lord OP, thank you for blessing us with your hard work and knowledge.",638
8avka1,"I'm 6'3 and used to weigh 270 but have gotten down to 237 over the past 4 months.

While I'm not so embarrassed to take my shirt off anymore I'd still like to lose a bit more weight and start developing some muscle.

I've always been above average in speed and agility, however I cannot just pick up and run 3 miles like other people. I never have been able to.

8c7wv3,"**Progress Pics:** https://imgur.com/ISkgxTP **25M** **Height:** 5'11"" **Starting Weight:** 140lbs soaking wet **Current Weight:** 188lbs when carb depleted **Progression:** The timeframe of these photos spans five years, and it's amazing to think that all I did was some pushups before bed! (jk obviously, but I will get to training later).  In the first pic, I was 140lbs in the summer of 2013, right before heading to university and beginning my weight training journey. I was weak, coming off of a breakup, and unhappy with my body – typical enough reasons to get into the weightroom. Pic two was two years later in the summer of 2015 after I had ballooned up to 185lbs on a pretty successful bulk care of the university dining hall (see-food diet, yo), running various strength training programs in the meantime (started with SS, transitioned to Madcows, then Texas Method, then back to SS because I was an idiot and didn't understand programming). Decided at this point that I wanted out of T-Rex mode, so began to count calories and take my training in an aesthetics-oriented direction. Pic three was taken in the spring of 2017 at a weight of around 180bs, with a massive cut and a lean bulk since the previous photo. During this time, I ran several ""aesthetics"" routines based around free weights and an alternation of of high volume/low intensity, and high intensity/low volume workouts. I started with PHAT, transitioned to the reddit PPL, and then devised my own PPL based on PHAT principles (3 heavy days followed by 3 volume days). The two years up to this photo I definitely saw the biggest changes in my physique, as I started to take my diet and training more seriously – counting calories became the norm, drinking tapered down as I entered my final years of uni, and I embraced the gym-rat lifestyle. Pic four is my current physique, roughly a year after pic three and after I really fine tuned both my diet and exercise. In this phase I adopted a flexitarian diet where all home-cooked meals were vegetarian, switched routines to a 5/3/1-based brosplit, and started doing daily cardio. Five years in the making, I have almost achieved my goal physique.      **Diet:** My current diet for the last year has been primarily plant-based, with the occasional meat eaten socially (I'm not one to turn down a pizza because it has a little bit of pepperoni on it). I bulked to around 210 by mid-December on a roughly 4000 calorie diet with a heavy emphasis on peanut butter and whole milk to hit required calories, and since January have been cutting on a ~2400 cal, 300C/50F/190P macro split utilizing IF and an EC stack to control my appetite. I also will program a cheat meal (usually a large pizza of an order of fried chicken) once every two weeks, typically for dinner on Sunday. * **Breakfast:** A nice early morning walk. No food though. * **Lunch:** A stir fry containing basmati rice, tofu or soy-based veggie ground, mushrooms, spinach, broccoli, and a variety of spices and low-calorie sauces. Usually comes out to about 600 cals, 50-60g of protein, and I cycle which veggies to include. * **Pre-workout Meal:** 30g steel-cut oats with a scoop of chocolate whey isolate, 30g of natural peanut butter, cinnamon and stevia to taste. * **Post-workout Meal:** The same as my pre-workout meal, just with doubled portions oats and whey. * **Dinner:** A similar stir-fry to what I have for lunch. * **Before-bed Snack:** 30g of peanut butter washed down with a big glass of skim milk. I uhh really love peanut butter. * **Sample day of eating (though the macros got kinda fucked and the meals don't exactly align):** https://imgur.com/ti8em1J **Routine:** Although this might get some hate as it is a rather unique and potentially sub-optimal routine, I am currently running a bro-split I've devised which utilizes 5/3/1 progression on main lifts with back work everyday, arms and calves three times a week, and a focus on machines for assistance and hypertrophy work. My current 1RMs are B:285/S:425/D:445/OHP:190, so I'm by no means a beast in the weightroom, but I'm happy with my level of strength and improvement (I started out benching just the bar ffs). Why this style of training in particular? Simple: Up to this point I'd never actually run a bro-split and used almost exclusively free-weights, so I'm changing things up for the sake of variety and gaining weightroom experience/learning how my body reacts to this style of training. (Note: brevity's sake, Hammer Strength machines will be abbreviated to HS. Also, all days conclude with 30 mins of LISS on either the stairmaster or incline treadmill) * **Monday: Bench and chest, bit of bis and back**: Bench 5/3/1 with 5x5-8 FSL, HS Incline Press 4x8-15, Dips or HS Decline Press 4x8-15, Pec Dec 4x12-20, Hammer Curls superset with Seated Calf Raises 3x10, 50 pullups throughout the workout.  * **Tuesday: Deadlift and back, abs:** Deadlift 5/3/1 with 5x5-8 FSL, HS Lat Pulldown 4x8-15, HS Row 4x8-15, HS Low Row 4x8-15, Facepulls 4x12-20, Hanging Knee Raises 4xF * **Wednesday: OHP and shoulders, bit of tris and back:** OHP 5/3/1 with 5x5-8 FSL, HS Shoulder Press 4x8-15, Lat Raises 4x12-20, RDF Machine 4x12-20, Rope Pushdown superset with Standing Calves 3x15, 50 pullups throughout the workout. Sometimes I'll also throw some facepulls in at the end. * **Thursday: Arms lol:** I don't really even program this day. I will start with 5 supersets of chins and dips, and then hit bis and tris for maybe 10-15 sets each with whatever exercises I want. An example day might be BB Curls 4x5-8. Hammer Curl 4x8-12, Preacher Curl 4x12-15, Skullcrusher 4x5-8, French Press 4x8-12, Rope Pushdown 4x12-15. * **Friday: Squarts and legs, abs:** Squats 5/3/1 with 5x5-8 FSL, Leg Press 5x5-10, Leg Curl 5x10-20, Leg Extension 5x10-20, any calf raise variant 5x8-30, Hanging Knee Raises 4xF, 50 pullups throughout workout. * **Saturday and Sunday: Fasted Walks:** I'll usually walk for a good two hours throughout the day, heading downtown for a coffee and some quiet contemplation. If I walk past a low hanging bar I'll usually bro-down and bang out a set of chins, too. **Where do I go from here?** Get bigger, leaner, and stronger bruhs. I will finish my cut on June 1st (as my uni graduation ceremony is in the 2nd, no real reason for cutting until then other than having a concrete goal) and then enter a lean-mass phase, and I hope to reach a 200lbs OHP, 300lbs bench, and 500lbs squat and deadlift by the end of the year.

8eg8k0,"I am just really excited and pretty proud of myself I was able to accomplish something I set my mind to. I can't really remember too many times in my life that I have actually felt proud of myself. I'm 29/m. Back in January I came here looking for a workout plan to start lifting with the goal of gaining strength. I started with the Phrak's GSLP plan and I did that for three months. I was weak, very weak, especially for my size. I am 6'4 and was close to 300lbs when I started.  For example I started benching 95lbs. My chest has always been weak. I just started doing 5/3/1 for beginners, and right now I am repping 175lbs. I know it's still not a lot, but the progress I have made in a fairly short amount of time has amazed me. Along with lifting I was doing cardio in the form of the stationary bike, but was getting bored so I started running. After a close friend ran a 10K, it inspired me to pick a run and start training for that, so I found a 10K in SF and started running. I used the 4-week to 10k program [https://www.verywellfit.com/4-week-beginner-10k-training-schedule-2910828]. Even with getting a pretty bad sinus infection last weekend, I was able to run the race yesterday and I achieved my goal of running the entire thing without walking. My time was 1:16:57. I am down to about 280lbs now, not a huge loss, but I have definitely lost more inches. I think with the lifting I replaced a lot of fat with muscle. I am very thankful of the sub, if you put your mind to something you can accomplish anything. I've always been overweight and fairly sedentary besides a year or so in college where I was going to the gym. I am thrilled to start this new healthy lifestyle with my wife. Thanks /r/fitness.","congrats, my man, keep it up!  but where are the progress pics? wanna see that beef.",55
8fkoqh,"**[Before/After](https://imgur.com/a/MiYqq)**  12/31/17: 172lbs; over 30% body fat   To   3/25/18: 152lbs; 22.2% body fat   &nbsp; All of the following info is based off the **[Lean Gains](https://leangains.com/the-leangains-guide/)** diet.    &nbsp; I ate between an 8-hour window and fasted for the other 16 hours of the day. My first meal would not be until 1 PM and my last meal would end around 9 PM.  I worked out 3 days a week doing heavy compound lifts and filled the other days with rest or some light cardio (basketball, a short run, jump rope, etc; more on all this later on)  &nbsp; First things first: get a body fat scan. There are plenty of places or ways to do this. The one I highly recommend is called **[Dexafit](https://www.dexafit.com/services/dexa-scan)**.   &nbsp; This will run you about $150 ($90 if you can find a Groupon) and will be the most comprehensive body-scan available. It uses X-ray to determine your exact body fat % and breaks it down by body part as well. It will also tell you your bone density and visceral (organ) fat. It was an eye opening experience for me and also served for more accurate macro-breakdown (plus it gave my fat-ass way more motivation).   &nbsp; Second: determine if you want to lose weight or gain weight aka whether you want to cut or bulk. You will then use a macro calculator to determine what your macros will be for YOUR diet. I used the following website to calculate my macros based on my height, weight, and current body fat % (was at roughly ~30% when I started this).  &nbsp; Here are the two calculators I used:  1.	http://www.lgmacros.com/standard-leangains-macro-calculator/#.WspHXsgh0go 2.	https://sareyko.net/leancalc/#/g=male/a=NaN/w=NaN/h=NaN/b=NaN/m=1.2/r=-20/t=20/p=2.5/e=NaN &nbsp;  The first one just has you enter your weight and the amount of protein per pound of body weight you want to eat. I used 1.3g/lb since I was cutting. Use this if you don’t know your body fat %.   &nbsp; The second calculator is a little more comprehensive and you can choose if you want to eat at a certain deficit on rest days/training days. On that calculator, choose “sedentary” for activity multiplier (unless you are constantly running around all day with your job) and for calorie split select “custom”. **I did -40% on rest days and -10% on training days.** This is aggressive, but I was more concerned with losing weight all together as opposed to just fat. I used the results from both of these to choose my macros, which were as follows:  &nbsp; Age: 26   Weight: 159   Body fat: 22.2%   Activity level: Sedentary   Calorie split: -40% rest days/-10% training days   &nbsp;   I created my own spreadsheet to track my macros. I put in all the food items I’d eat regularly and add new ones as needed. After a certain point, I ate the same thing every day. My average days were as follows: &nbsp;  **Training days** (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday):  &nbsp;  1,846 calories/30g fat/203g carbs/191g protein  &nbsp;   **262g Kirkland egg whites** (262 cals, 0g carbs, 0g fat, 28.5g protein)   **445g Goya black beans** (475 cals, 1.8g fat, 83.9g carbs, 29.2g protein)   **255g Chipotle chicken** (410 cals, 15.9g fat, 0 g carbs, 72.9g protein)   **300g Chipotle white rice** (563 cals, 10.7g fat, 107g carbs, 10.7g protein)   **225g Fat-free Fage Greek yogurt** (129 cals, 0g fat, 8.9g carbs, 22.8g protein)   **35g whey protein muscle milk** (130 cals, 1.5g fat, 3g carbs, 27g protein)  &nbsp; **Rest days** (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday): &nbsp;  1,200 calories/36g fat/27g carbs/191g protein  &nbsp;  **169g Kirkland egg whites** (92 cals, 0g fat, 0g carbs, 18.4 g protein)   **302g Chipotle chicken** (485 cals, 18.9g fat, 0g carbs, 86.3g protein)   **23g almonds** (139 cals, 12.3g fat, 4.1g carbs, 4.9g protein)   **150g Daisy Cottage Cheese** (120 cals, 3.3g fat, 5.3g carbs, 17.3g protein)   **367g Fat-free Fage Greek Yogurt** (210 cals, 0g fat, 14.6g carbs, 37.2g protein)  &nbsp; I dislike cooking and the time constraints of it, so my meals involve no cooking whatsoever. Plus, I get to eat Chipotle every single day and still comply with my diet. You’re free to do whatever works for you. I spent about ~$100/week on food.  &nbsp; **HERE IS MY SPREADSHEET AND HOW TO USE IT:**  &nbsp; **[Macro spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14bMUZVEY2Onmfq9rLUYorfOzsUqm1O3arZBeIL-8ujA/edit?usp=sharing)**  &nbsp; I made this a shareable google doc so anyone can access it. First thing: copy the whole thing, paste it into your own google sheet/excel doc. &nbsp;  Then, add in your macros for training day and rest days. Put in the calories, fat, carbs, protein for each day.  &nbsp; All the foods I ate are listed on there. I used the nutritional information from the label/company website/google to calculate everything by hand. Unlike MyFitnessPal or anything like that, all you do is measure the food you’re eating **(IN GRAMS)** and put that into the “quantity” section and let the spreadsheet do the rest. &nbsp;  **IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE A FOOD ITEM:**   Easiest thing to do is just delete one of my items and replace it with your own   a.	Example: change “Eggs; large Grade A; Publix” to whatever you want   b.	In cell **C4** change the **serving size** of the food you are eating (make sure its in grams). Look on label of food for info or google if need be   c.	In cell **E4** change the “70” in the formula to the **calories** of the food you are eating (per serving size)   d.	In cell **F4** change the “5” in the formula to the **fat** content of the food you are eating (per serving size)   e.	In cell **G4** change the “0” in the formula to the **carb** content of the food you are eating (per serving size)   f.	In cell **H4** change the “6” in the formula to the **protein** content of the food you are eating (per serving size)   g.	You are good to go. There are enough entries that you should be able to edit them without having to add new cells, which becomes a bit confusing as far as the excel formula; if you NEED to add a cell:   h.	make sure you click on “insert row”   i.	The formula is **=sum[(quantity x macro content)/serving size]**   j.	ALWAYS MAKE SURE THE “TOTAL” COLUMN ADDS UP ALL YOUR CELLS IF YOU ADD ONE. ALWAYS BEST TO DOUBLE CHECK. CONSEQUENTLY, THE “TOTALS” (BOTTOM OF EACH MEAL) OF BREAKFAST, LUNCH, SNACK, DINNER SHOULD ALL ADD UP FOR THE “DAILY TOTAL” NUMBERS IN CELLS K3, L3, M3, N3. DM me for clarification!  &nbsp; I always keep my sheet in a google doc so I can access it on my phone if I’m away from a computer. I typically figure out what I need to eat for the entire day before my first meal. It’s easier to comply with the diet that way and eliminates any cravings (for the most part).  &nbsp; As for working out, I did RPT (reverse pyramid training). The workout was taken from reddit user 31Minutes in an AMA he did about his success with the Lean Gains diet.  His workout was as follows: &nbsp;  **RPT Workout**  &nbsp; **A: Back day**   Deadlift	2x3-5   Press	 2x6-8   Weighted Chins	2x4-6   Rows	2x6-8   Close grip Chins	1x6-10  &nbsp;  **B: Chest Day**   Bench press	2x6-8   Incline DB bench	2x6-8   Barbell curls	2x6-8   Triceps extension	2x6-8  &nbsp;  **C: Leg day**   Squat or leg press	2x6-8   Leg curl	2x6-8   Leg extensions	2x6-8   Calves	1x12-16   Cable crunches	1x8-10 &nbsp;  **Your first set is always the heaviest.** Try and stay in the rep range. On the second set, you do 90% of the weight on your first set and do ONE MORE REP THAN ON YOUR FIRST SET. So on deadlift, if you did 300x4 on your first set, your second set is 270x5. Here is the AMA that 31minutes did with further explanation of the sets/rep range. &nbsp;  **[31Minutes AMA condensed](https://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1jlsfx/tldr_guide_of_31minutes_ama_pdf/)**  &nbsp; Remember, every streak starts with one day. If I can do this, so can you. Happy gains.",by keeping your caloric intake lower than the amount you burn. ,2353
8frtzl,"###Link: https://youtu.be/rnQtIGJm20M Hi everybody, Antranik here again. A couple weeks ago I posted a [video here](https://redd.it/8aoec7) showing how to do basic reverse crunches because they are much more effective at building a **stronger core** than regular crunches. Now that you are acquainted with this wonderful exercise, it's probably not as difficult anymore and you can take them to the next level so that you could get stronger! (When you're able to do many reps of an exercise, you need to find ways to up the intensity: things that are harder make you stronger. ) ---- #Level 1: Basic Reverse Crunches ([First video](https://youtu.be/iVVeZRlcuY4) covers the beginning of this) 1. On Fingertips 2. On Palms 3. Hands Up In the Air (New) ------------ In the [second video,](https://youtu.be/rnQtIGJm20M) I introduce the ""hands up in the air"" variation and then the ""bottoms up"" variation below... and I also show how to use a blanket as a prop to protect ya neck! Safety first! #Level 2: Intermediate ""Bottoms Up"" 1. On Fingertips (New) 2. With Hands Up (New) ------------------ **Recommended Modification:** * The bottoms up variation is nothing new but nobody ever mentions how important it is to protect your freakin neck! * Use folded up blankets placed under your upper back to reduce the neck flexibility required to perform this exercise properly. If you have lots of experience with the [shoulderstand in yoga,](https://i.imgur.com/3Y20E54.png) then you'll likely be fine, but if you don't, it's best you use that prop. **Intermediary Progression tip:** * If doing it both arms up in the air is much too difficult, yet doing it with both arms down is far too easy, then you could do it with one arm down and the other up as an interim progression. I hope that helps! Let me know if you got any questions, comments and please contribute with tips on how YOU take these to the next level!",I’m not ready for more advanced positions but I certainly clicked on the video to see if your dog was joining again. ,467
8grr3j,"**Original** After years of hard work, this is my latest cut picture and the first one I am really proud of. First, here's the [Progress Picture](https://imgur.com/Oeg7DNB). At 41, I'm older than most here. I'm going to outline some things I've learned in the hope that it will help others. I have three big takeaways that I want to lay out. 1\) This progression shows what is possible when starting out as a skinny\-fat desk worker in your late 30's. I have never had a muscular physique nor excelled in sports to any degree. 2\) Over the past few years exercising years I've gotten much stronger, and I have bulked and cut many many times. But whenever I cut, I was disappointed with the results. I simply became skinny, with little definition. But this last cut was different for a few reasons. * I switched to a body building routine * I paid extra attention to to abs and obliques * I counted protein religiously * I took the plunge and cut an extra 7 lbs lower than I normally do, even though this put me at seemingly low overall weight 3\) I got a surprising result. DEXA showed I was able to gain 4 lbs of lean to my ""lower trunk"" despite being on a drastic cut. I believe this was possible due to noob gains. This is odd since I have been power\-lifting for many years. But only during my cut did I concentrate hard on exercises exclusively hitting abs and obliques. My theory is that you can experience noob gains in specific areas that are underdeveloped while cutting. **Quick Background** I've always been really skinny. I was 125 lbs in high school 5'11"". Working out daily and playing football didn't change that. \(My buddies all packed on muscle, but I stayed super\-thin\) After high school I packed on weight, but it was all fat. [At 35 I was 170 lbs, very skinny fat.](https://imgur.com/bI9RGiP) I had bad wrists and a bad back.  I was probably well over 35&#37; BF, judging by future DEXA scans. But I still looked pretty ""thin"" in clothes.  I had a pot\-belly. 4 years ago I discovered keto on Reddit and gave it a shot. I lost a ton of weight going down to about 149 lbs. This was the first time I felt in control of my body. I lost lots of fat, but now I was really skinny and weak. I then started to exercise slowly, learning along the way.  I started with exercise bands, and a simple workout. \(I was so weak!\) I eventually got into power lifting and olympic lifting. I wasn't great at it, but I kept getting stronger. **Lifting Scores** My lifting scores were really at the bottom. Starting lifting scores * DL **95** lbs * Squat **65** lbs * Bench **65** lbs Over the next few years I found routines, hit the gym 5\-6 days a week and made progress. I cycled my bulks and cuts. I made mistakes along the way. Current lifting scores * DL **350** lbs \(yay\) * Squat **215** lbs \(meh\) * Bench **165** lbs \(boo\) \(Dead lifting comes easy to me, which is great considering I used to have chronically bad wrists and lower back. That's all gone now, and I feel fantastic.\) Note: I have relatively long arms. That probably helps my deadlift and hurts my bench. **Main mistakes over the years past** * I bulked too fast, causing me to have to cut too much. I chased the immediate power lifting scores at the expense of packing on fat. One time I bulked added 2.6lbs per week! I now aim for .6lbs per week. * I didn't count protein. Once I did, I realized I was deficient. ""I eat fine. I don't need to count macros. I don't want to live like a lab rabbit."" I was wrong.  You should count macros at least once. This will give you a good audit of your diet. You'll be forced to make adjustments. Going forward you'll have a better intuitive idea of your macros and better habits. * I didn't stick to rigorous programs at first. My worst progress was when I just went to the gym and ""worked out really hard"".  My best progress was when I decided on a program and stuck to it for many months. **This Last Cut** I was invited to a fun pirate party for a friends 50th birthday. I challenged myself to go semi\-bare chested and show off a great physique. I knew of the event 6 months in advance, so I planned accordingly. So far every time I very time I cut I just looked thin, with no definition. I had 4 DEXAs previously and doing the math I calculated that I needed to cut to nearly 135lbs! I never had the nerve to cut so low as it sounded ridiculous. But considering that I was 125 lbs in high school, maybe it makes some sense. I was very nervous of the outcome. **Results** [No one was more shocked than me at the results.](https://imgur.com/GAZyjAu) Several friends asked if I was wearing some sort of fake muscle shirt! After the photo \(and party\) I stopped cutting, I shot up nearly 5 lbs overnight. The abs remain but they are much less defined now. \(The DEXA showing 13&#37; was taken 10 days after the party.\) [This is what I looked like a few weeks later at 145 lbs](https://imgur.com/dbxwcwG) **Stats** Weight160lbs =\> 138lbs \(22lbs Lost\) Age41 years old BF&#37; At final I used three methods * 13&#37; \- DEXA \(10 days after picture\) * 7&#37;  \- Calipers \(5\-point Jackson Pollock\) * 10.45&#37; \- Impedance Scale **DEXA Scan Results** My cut was pretty drastic. I was worried that I'd lose muscle. I took a ""before"" DEXA. It was many months before I started the cut, but it's a pretty good comparison. **Previous DEXA to Final picture was** * 19.4&#37; =\> 13&#37; * Lean 7.2lbs **GAINED** * Fat 10.0lbs **LOST** **Diet** DEXA scan says my RMR is 1500. My cal/day started at 2,000 and tapered down to 1,000 cal / day towards the end. Looking at my daily log Week 1: 2,000 cal per day Week 2: 1,500 cal per day Week 4: 1,300 cal per day Week 6: 1,200 cal per day Week 8 \- 10: 900 cal per day \(But If I'm honest I was not hitting that and averaging 1,025 cal per day\) This is pretty extreme so I started cutting out 200 calories a day over a week to ease into it. **Breakfast** * Coffee with 1 tbsp heavy cream **Lunch** * Low cal fish \(Talapia, Mahi Mahi\) \(no oil\) * 8oz brussle sprouts **Snack**\(I'd usually eat my snack right before hitting the gym\) * Protein bar or shake \(Epic Chicken bar has 15g Protein and 100cals\) * Alternates: Pork Rinds, Sardines in Water on Lettuce, Bone Broth, Greek Yogurt, 2 eggs **Dinner** * 8oz New York Steak * Alternates: Chicken, Turkey, Shrimp * Veggies **Alcohol** * No way, Jose. No cheating this time. **Exercise Routine** Before this cut I have never done a bodybuilding routine. I have only done power lifting routines with accessories. Previous routine was nSuns AMRAP. I also ran Ben Pollack's Unf\* your Program. The nSuns had the biggest impact bringing my combined power lifting score from **538lbs** to **779lbs.** During the cut I did **Scott Herman's Bodybuilding Split**. Which is basically * Monday: Chest \(Dumbell, cable flys, etc\) * Tuesday: Back,Biceps, obliques \(pull downs, curls, etc\) * Wednesday Glutes,Quads,Traps \(Squat, etc\) * Thursday: Hamstrings Shoulders \(Dead lift, Lat Raises, etc\) * Friday: Abs and Obliques * Saturday: Rest * Sunday: Start Over **Cardio** * Moderate. * 20 minutes Stairmaster after a workout. Some light jogging for 20 minutes at a time. **A Note on Abs and Obliques** My obliques got HUGE. DEXA literally says that I gained 4lbs of the total 7lbs in my lower trunk area \(abs and obliques\). I am positive that all of this happened during the cut and not before. A few thoughts. I think I was severely under trained in my obliques, thus I was able to experience the magical noob\-gains in that area, while my other, more trained areas, stayed about the same. *Compound lifts alone did NOT work my abs and obliques enough.* I needed target exercises such as * Wood Choppers * Side Bends *They key seems to be to do these SLOW, controlled, with solid form, and really feel the obliques. Mentally isolate the oblique and try to only use that muscle for the exercise.* \-\- I hope that this encourages some older folks or skinny\-fat folks to hang in there and stay the course. And remember kids, count your protein. \-\- EDIT **My Lifting Scores** I HAVE NOT been ""lifting for four years"". Four years ago I started to diet and get more healthy. The first few years of my four\-year journey consisted of light exercises, learning how to exercise. I didn't even know what a squat or deadlift was 2\+ years ago. I started my first serious strength program \(nSUNS AMRAP\) 13 months ago.  I added 270lbs to my combined score within 6 months. As stated in the ""Mistakes"" section, I wasted time by not following a rigorous program. Being a strongman powerlifter is NOT my goal.  I am not offering powerlifting advice or claiming to be good at it. **Frame\-Size** I'm really small\-framed. So please keep that in mind before applying anything I did to you. My dad and brother are  6'4"" and naturally hover at 280lbs.  They have big hands and thick wrists. \(My dad once dieting down to 210lbs and he was THIN.\) My brother told me that even if he doesn't workout for a few years he can walk into the gym rep 215lb on the bench with ease. My wrists are 5.75""! \(I think that's considered small even for a woman.\) I wear a size small shirt, have a 30"" waste, small wrists, small ankles, narrow feet. I naturally hover at about 160 lbs. My DEXA shows my RMR at only 1500 cal/day. Most guys are naturally much larger and need more calories. I do not recommend my daily cal/day for others. Also, this was a **temporary** cut over 10 weeks for a **specific date**. This is not a lifestyle, this is an experiment. \-\- **Bonus Photos** [In celebration of hitting 3.5k upvotes, here's a bonus pirate photo!](https://imgur.com/zVGeS0a) ARG!

No doubt at all that this helped limit the major fatigue issues. There was still 2 days every chemo cycle I couldn't get myself out of bed, but was able to fully operate every other day. also worth keeping in mind I am quite young (mid 40's) and a lot of the other folks in there were in a lot worse shape who would benefit from exercise but would need a lot more consideration for what they could do",1653

8jrdsm,So I've been working out on and off at home with a pair of dumb bells however it gets a little boring doing the same set of exercises and I'm also limited in the weights I can use. I'd definitely like to try something new with the various machines at the gym.  My only problem is I hate the idea of going to a gym and working out in front of others. Seems like such a stupid thing to be worried about but I can't help it. Has anyone been in a similar situation before? What did you do to convince yourself? I feel like I'm at the tipping point of joining but am having a tough time pushing myself off the edge. Edit - wow guys this really blew up holy shit. Appreciate all the responses. Edit 2 - Yes I get it introvert wasn't the correct terminology/word to use. More social anxiety. I think enough people have pointed that out already lol,"That's not being introverted, that's social anxiety. Force yourself to go once, and you'll get used to it. Everyone is there to improve their body. ",5232
8kyyxw,So I’m a 20 year old guy who lives alone. I’m lazy and I’m terrible at cooking. I don’t know how to start a healthy diet and maintain it. I eat fast food everyday... once a day. Ive done this since last april. I feel pretty dead on the inside. I get agitated a lot. I have constant headaches. I don’t gain or lose weight.  I feel like I either have or am going to have a major disease soon if I keep doing this.  I’m at a normal weight but I am far from healthy.  Can someone help me / give me any advice?  Edit: Thank you all for the insanely helpful feedback. I am trying to read each comment (I did not expect this much feedback). The key element I’ve been taking from this thread is to take baby steps. I also need to stop making excuses and just start trying. ,"What do you mean you're bad at cooking? You literally just put shit in a pan or something and wait. Get some meat and frozen veggies and canned beans. Google how to make rice too, it's really not that hard. Read around here /r/cookingforbeginners /r/eatcheapandhealthy Edit: oh yeah and don't say you don't want to eat this because it tastes bland. You need to use seasonings and shit. Buy soy sauce and chili sauce. Put stuff like pepper, garlic powder and dill, thyme, tarragon on everything or just make up any combo you want and nothing will taste bland again.",1604
8ldda9,"**27M 6’3”** **Starting Weight: 205 lbs** **Current Weight: 188 lbs** Around 2.5 years ago my now wife and I went on a trip to Costa Rica with her family for the Christmas holiday break. When I got back and looked at pictures of myself it really hit me that I was no longer that guy who could eat whatever he wanted and not gain any weight. In my teens and early twenties I was pretty active, played sports, and never had to pay much attention to what I ate. Somewhere along the lines I stopped being as active and everything started catching up with me. I started hitting the gym that week and haven’t stopped since. I initially dropped from 205 to 178 in about 6 months, so about a pound per week \(more in the beginning, less towards the end\). I did IIFYM and IF and tried to eat about 80&#37; clean and 20&#37; treats. I lifted in the past for sports, so I knew my way around weights enough to get by. I started out with some random routine I found online that was some sort of reverse pyramid training 3 days a week, but I honestly can’t remember exactly what it was. After my initial cut, I had kind of a fail on my first bulk and put on too much fat and not enough muscle. I cut down again and ended up around 181 with slightly higher body fat, so I didn’t really add much mass. Finally did my first successful bulk/cut this past year starting last June. I just finished up cutting down for the summer from my bulked weight of 204 to 188 and am probably at the lowest body fat I’ve ever been. I’m guessing I’ll end up around 190\-192 when I start eating more again and upping my carb intake. For both the bulk and cut I did a PPL routine 6 days a week and dropped volume as needed during my cut. I stuck with IIFYM throughout and did IF when cutting. I also added some cardio towards the end of my cut, either walking up hill or jump rope. Overall I’ve learned a lot these past couple years and have really enjoyed lifting and bodybuilding as a new hobby. Looking forward to starting my next bulk soon. Feel free to ask any questions, I’d be happy to provide more info for those that are interested. **Pictures:** From top to bottom: [https://imgur.com/a/7nNyXRj](https://imgur.com/a/7nNyXRj) 1. Before and after 2. Start: 205 lbs 3. After first cut: 178 lbs 4. After first bulk/cut \(kind of a fail\): 181 lbs 5. After recent bulk: 204 lbs 6. After recent cut: 188 lbs 7. Collage of them all in one picture **More Detailed info:** **Diet:** I use MFP to track everything that I eat. I try to eat clean 80&#37; of the time and then treat myself 20&#37; of the time with sweets or really fatty foods. I do about \~1 g/lb body weight for protein, \~0.4 g/lb body weight fat, and the rest carbs. I eat anywhere from 2000\-3400 calories depending on if I am bulking or cutting and my TDEE is somewhere around 2800. I eat a lot of chicken, but am not a fan of just baked chicken, rice, and veggies. I try to mix it up and make different things but here are some go\-tos: · Chicken Tacos · Chicken Stir fry \(use riced cauliflower instead of rice when cutting\) · Pizza on cauliflower crust \(Trader Joe’s has a good one but it’s on the higher end for carbs\) · Pasta \(use spaghetti squash when cutting\) · Chicken chili · Some prepackaged pastas, Indian food, etc from Trader Joes · Lunch meat wraps on lavash \(low cal for a large wrap with a lot of fiber\) · Protein shakes I like to try new things and my wife and I will often try different recipes and modify ingredients to make them “healthier”. It helps me keep on my diet to have some go to things where I know all the macros, but also try new things to keep from getting bored. However, I do eat pretty much the same turkey wrap for lunch every day. I’m typically too busy during the day to care what I eat and it fits in with my macros well most of the time. When I’m bulking I also add in things like bagels and cereal for extra carbs. I also have a protein shake almost every day. A sample cutting meal would be: · 10 AM Post Workout: Protein Shake · 12 PM lunch: Turkey wrap on lavash with chips \(the baked Jalapeno chips\) and sometimes another shake · 7 PM dinner: Chicken tacos with Mexican rice and veggies for dinner Bulking is similar, but I add: · A bagel with cream cheese for breakfast. · Milk and sometimes fruit or peanut butter added to protein shake. · More carbs with dinner, so have more rice with tacos for instance. · A bowl of cereal with 2&#37; milk before bed. **Lifting:** I honestly don’t remember much about my first routine when I initially lost weight and unfortunately I lost the spreadsheet I had on my phone. It was a reverse pyramid training program that was split up into a 3 day per week workout. More recently I have been doing a PPL routine: 6 days per week starting with push on Monday. I typically rest on Sundays, but sometimes in the middle of the week if something comes up. I’ve subbed in different lifts at different times and like to play around with new lifts from time to time, but here is an example of what I would do on each day. **Push:** incline or flat bench \(3x8\), shoulder press \(3x8\), chest flyes \(3x12\), lateral raises \(3x12\), tricep extensions \(3x12\), tricep pull downs or dips \(3x12\) **Pull:** seated rows \(3x8\), weighted pull ups \(3x8\), single arm rows \(3x12\), face pulls \(3x12\), barbell curls \(3x8\), hammer curls \(3x12\) **Legs:** squats or leg press \(3x8\), straight leg deadlifts \(3x8\), leg extensions \(3x12\), leg curls \(3x12\), calf raises \(3x12\), some sort of abs \(switched up frequently\) I do different rep ranges from 4x6 to 3x12 and typically stick to higher weight lower reps for the compound exercises and vice versa for accessories, but I switch things up periodically to keep myself engaged. Some numbers: Incline bench: 215 3x8 \(haven’t done flat in a while honestly, but probably around 240 3x8\) OHP: 160 3x8 Squat: 275 3x5 Pull\-ups: bw \+ 55 3x8 Seated rows: 215 3x8 I don’t deadlift anymore, but SLDL: 275 3x5 I tore my hamstring a while back so leg numbers didn’t progress as well as upper body since I had to stop training them for a while. I also add in some cardio like walking on the treadmill at an incline or jumping rope when I’m near the end of my cut. **Lessons Learned:** **IF and IIFYM are great:** I think intermittent fasting is great for cutting. I’m not sold on all the extra benefits that some claim it gives, but it does allow me to eat a giant delicious dinner every night, which really helps keep me on my diet. I also really enjoy IIFYM since it allows me to work in foods I really enjoy on a regular basis. Make sure to get enough micronutrients though as that can be easy to overlook sometimes. Eat your vegetables and take a multivitamin. **DON’T DIRTY BULK:** If you really want to, go for it, but I don’t think it’s worth it. I had a great few months on my first “bulk” just eating whatever I wanted and getting nice and fat. But I ended up putting on mostly fat and made barely any progress once I cut down. If you’re natural I just can’t see a reason to do this. Your body can only put on so much muscle at a time. I still like bulking/cutting rather than doing a very slow bulk year\-round because I think you get better results and I like switching it up, but you have to bulk within reason. **Stick with a program:** While I do like to tweak things here and there, I think it’s important to stick to a base program for a decent period of time. Don’t waste your time trying to find the new best thing every other month. Just pick something and stick to it. Unless you’re a very advanced lifter most programs will work for you and you’ll be more inclined to continue going to the gym if you stick with one routine. Feel free to make some small modifications if you want to keep things interesting or fit your needs better, but don’t gut your whole program. **Weekly Treat/Cheat meals are awesome:** Every week I have one meal where I don’t track the calories or macros at all, although I don’t go too crazy and eat an entire pizza and order of breadsticks by myself. Typically my wife and I will go out to dinner somewhere. This really helps keep me on my diet and makes me feel good from both a mental and physical standpoint. **Have a workout buddy:** If you enjoy working out on your own that’s definitely fine, but I find it helpful to have someone to lift with. My wife and I do a great job of keeping each other on track and doing thing like pushing the other to go to the gym when feeling lazy. It’s nice to have someone else to help motivate you when you may not always have the motivation yourself. **Track your changes:** Take tons of measurements and progress pics. It’s the only way to know for sure how you are progressing and it may seem tedious but you’ll be thankful for that info when you want to reflect back and see how far you’ve come. If you’re a nerd like me, put it all in excel and make lots of charts :\). **Fit in cardio where you can**: When you’re cutting you can fit in random times to do cardio to help with the weight/fat loss. I used to walk to and from work which came out to around 3 miles of walking a day. I didn’t realize it but it definitely added up. Also, my wife and I live in the city so we take nightly walks around the neighborhood. It’s about a mile and half of walking and it’s a nice added bonus of getting to spend extra time together.","You clearly deserve this: Awesome pics. Great size. Look thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips. Show us what you got man. Wanna see how freakn' huge, solid, thick and tight you can get. Thanks for the motivation",988
8n2um1,"## Grip Strength Boost ### Introduction Hey there, athletes of r/fitness! Do you want to get better Grip Strength? Grip Strength Boost is a free 30-day program for forearm hypertrophy and grip strength. You only need a barbell with weights and something to hang from (pull up bar) to participate. It consists of 7 different exercises that are spread throughout the week with a high number of sets and reps. What are you waiting for? Let's start today! There are two ways to do this program: You can do it with my **[Daily Follow-Along-Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMbhtPPa11I&amp;list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)**, or just read the rep/set schemes in this post and do them in your own pace. ### The Program **Who is this program for? It's for advanced beginners; people who have spent between 6 months and 3 years in a strength sport of their choice and want to focus on their grip strength for 30 days straight.** * This is a hypertrophy program. If you've trained for pure strength in your grip for some time, it's a good idea to mix in some hypertrophy focused exercises now and then. This program might be the missing link when you plateau. Almost all muscles in the forearms are slow-twitch muscles, which grow bigger much better from endurance-focused stimulus. That means, for the forearms, high reps/low weight are better for hypertrophy then low reps/high weight. The rest periods between the exercises are low, between 10 and 30 seconds. * You chose the weights yourself for each exercise, which means you'll need a few days to find the correct weight for you. Your muscles should have a good pump at the end of each training day. If you feel nothing, you need to go higher with the weights. If it's too hard, just lower the weight. * There are almost no rest days. Some days have much more volume then others. * The first two weeks have less volume and focus on getting used to the single exercises. The third and fourth week have a lot more volume and more exercises each day. This might look random at first, but it's not. * You will benchmark your progress at the end of every week by doing your max on all 7 exercises with 30 seconds rest in between. * Each training day takes about 5 to 15 minutes. * You do this program in addition to your normal workout! ### The Exercises There are 7 exercises in total in this program: * [Plate Pinches](https://i.imgur.com/eWbvm4l.png) * [Barbell Crush](https://i.imgur.com/luSW2wL.png) * [Barbell Support](https://i.imgur.com/T65YfIw.png) * [Wrist Curls](https://i.imgur.com/gfDO1vt.png) * [Reverse Wrist Curls](https://i.imgur.com/q6H0Goa.png) * [(Towel) Hanging](https://i.imgur.com/UwUPoX1.png) * [Fingertip Holds](https://i.imgur.com/ZsU5ofH.png) ### Detailed Reps &amp; Sets **[You can also do Grip Strength Boost as a daily follow-along video (Click here).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMbhtPPa11I&amp;list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)** [Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qVYcD7o_fs&index=2&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUvYlgr_yHA&index=3&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[Day 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKylbyIDZ9c&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=4)|[Day 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-7CrMO_1Dg&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=5)|[Day 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5EdQ56qu6c&index=6&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[Day 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1ZVHl0FFuk&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=7)|[Day 7 (Benchmark)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFt1LOkpkCY&index=8&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9) :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:-- [^^Day ^^1 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qVYcD7o_fs&index=2&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[^^Day ^^2 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUvYlgr_yHA&index=3&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[^^Day ^^3 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKylbyIDZ9c&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=4)|[^^Day ^^4 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-7CrMO_1Dg&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=5)|[^^Day ^^5 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5EdQ56qu6c&index=6&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9)|[^^Day ^^6 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1ZVHl0FFuk&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9&index=7)|[^^Day ^^7 ^^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFt1LOkpkCY&index=8&list=PLRpkzoMo7s2ZTVdIoe9-hRS97JQt8JNf9) Hang - 8x15 sec.|Barbell Support - 6x30 sec.|Towel Hang - 6x15 sec.|Barbell Support - 9x10 sec.|Barbell Crush - 6x20 reps.|Fingertip Hold - 6x5 sec.|Double Towel Hang - MAX Plate Pinch - 8x15 sec.|Barbell Crush - 6x20 reps.|Fingertip Hold - 6x10 sec.|Plate Pinch - 9x10 sec.|Wrist Curl - 6x20 reps.|Plate Pinch 6x5 sec.|Barbell Support - MAX *No rest.*|*30 sec. rest between sets.*|Alt.

Just do the next program-day everytime you go to the gym. E.g: If you go to the gym 3 days a week, you exercise program-day 1+2+3 in that week. You will still make good progress this way! *** **Question:** I have [insert medical condition], can i still do this program? **Answer:** Please talk to your doctor first. Don't start this program if you have pre-existing injuries. Since there are almost no rest days, it's going to be tough on your tendons and you don't want to aggravate pre-existing injuries! *** **Question:** An exercise in this program is too hard for me, which exercise can i do instead? **Answer:** Change the exercise into an easier variation! For example kneeling fingertip holds, or normal hanging from the bar instead of towel hangs. If you can't complete the workout for the day because your fingers are too tired, stop and rest. Listen to your body. *** **Question:** Can i do this program even though i workout regularily? **Answer:** YES! Grip Strength Boost is meant to be **in addition** to your normal workouts! Always do it after your normal workout so you don't tire out on your main lifts. *** **Question:** What do i do after i have finished the 30 days challenge? **Answer:** Write me feedback on how it went, please! Thank you! Afterwards, i recommend switching to the **[Basic Routine by David Horne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGuVJAj96SE)**, which is the official r/GripTraining workout! It'll give you good gains for years to come. *** **Question:** Do you have a printable **.pdf file**? **Answer:** **[.pdf file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/91p6tmle5u8p1pn/30%20Day%20Grip%20Strength%20Boost.pdf?dl=0)**, made by u/IsDaedalus!

8ogzss,"26/M/5’10 - How Fitness Transformed me from an Obese, Narrow-Minded Gamer into a Wildly Different Person **PHOTOS:** [Before and After Photos](https://imgur.com/a/zhqy9Ux) (TLDR):  **Weight:**  215lbs —> 155 lbs (That’s 97.5kg down to 70.3kg)  **Time Period:**  Technically 3 years of weight loss (explained in post) but the most dramatic changes happened in the past year. I started lifting in May of 2017.  **Lift Progress Summary:** DL:       95lbs -–> 295x3 (275x5) Squat:  75lbs —> 265x5 Bench: 105lbs –> 185x3 (175x5) OHP:    65lbs —> 115x5  Never did 1-rep Maxes. These are just the highest lifts I’ve recorded in the gym.   Most of these are from a few months ago when I weighed a few more pounds and my lifting routine was more ‘consistent.’ My lifts are a bit lower now.  **Program:**  For the most part, I based it on u/metallicadpa ’s PPL Program. It’s available in the ‘recommended routines’ in this subreddit’s wiki. EDIT: A lot of folks in the comments asked for a link to the PPL program. Here it is: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/  *Disclaimer: I didn’t truly follow this program as prescribed. And to be honest, if I had stuck to this program more strictly, I’m sure I would’ve seen a lot better results. It’s very effective. But for a variety of life/personal reasons combined with some fuckarounditis, it wouldn’t be fair to the creator to say that I ‘actually’ followed his program for a full year. Nonetheless, I’m pretty happy with my progress so far and I owe a lot to this program for giving me my foundation.*  **Diet** As for Diet, I just tracked my calories with MyFitnessPal.   The specifics of what I ate are not too important - but the act of counting calories consistently is the single most important thing I did in this entire journey.   Yes daily calorie-tracking is tedious. Yes it sucks. But that’s exactly why so many people fail at weight loss. If you want the results bad enough, you’ll do it.  *Anyway - A typical day of eating might look like this:*  -I skip breakfast most days. I guess this means I “intermittent fast.” It works for me because I’m not hungry in the morning and I’m always very hungry after work / in the evening.  Lunch (~420 calories) * Turkey sandwich on thin wheat * * Sliced orange/yellow bell peppers   * Dannon Light/Fit Greek Yogurt  I like to meal prep this on Sundays so it’s basically on auto-pilot.  Dinner: (1000-1100 calories) * Chicken Breast - 8-12oz * Small/healthy microwaveable meals, usually with Chicken (think weight watchers, healthy choice, etc)   * Steamed Vegetables   * A few cups of Greek Yogurt   Also coffee and water. Copious amounts of black coffee and water.  **PREFACE:** First, this is probably not the most dramatic transformation you’ll ever read. But this roughly marks 1 year of ‘getting my shit’ together so it seems like a fitting time for a progress post. So much has changed for me in the last year, between work, life, fitness, and more - and most of it started with discovering the r/fitness community a year ago. So it felt like the right time to post something.  Second, while this post is not about video games - some sections will talk about them in-detail. I’ll try to mark the sections as skippable for the non-gaming audience here. But I think there are a lot of folks, specifically gamers, who might be in a similar situation to the ‘old’ me. So I’m leaving those details in this story for folks who might be in a similar phase of their fitness journey to where I used to be.  Lastly, I’ll note that I don’t believe video games are inherently ‘bad’ (I still enjoy them a lot from time to time). It’s just that in my case, my old approach to games reinforced a very problematic and sedentary lifestyle. A lifestyle that I’m now happy to be rid of.  Alright, let’s begin -   **Background / How I got fat**  I’ve actually been out of shape for most of my life.  I almost never exercised or thought at all about the consequences of what I was eating. I typically ate whatever was either convenient or tasted good without ever thinking about what I was putting into my body.   Growing up, I never had any athletic sports that I was passionate about, but I definitely did have a ‘competitive drive.’ My main hobby growing up was playing video games - a hobby that i’ve loved since as long as I could remember holding a SNES controller in my hands. As I got older, this ‘drive’ manifested itself in my gaming experience. Starting with Halo, then Starcraft 2 (hey look at my reddit name), then eventually League of Legends and more - the drive kept me hooked on games. I was determined to get better.   The positive side - is that I developed some helpful habits that helped me to get decently good at games. I had the discipline to constantly self-criticize my own play, refine my technique, and learn from gaming professionals in order to get better than my peers and improve.  But this ‘drive’ mindset was a double-edged sword. While the ‘focus’ was certainly valuable, I realize now that I was actually extremely narrow-minded. I ignored many other critical aspects of my life in favor of competitive improvement. It took me a long time to realize this. Snapping out of it - really all began here with r/fitness.  **College - The Weight-Gain Train**  When I went to college, everything got worse...waaaaaaay worse. My newfound ‘freedom’ led to increased consumption of junk food, much more heavy drinking. I basically realized I could eat Pizza and Chipotle whenever I wanted. So I did just that.  I was also a chronic procrastinator and had a very unhealthy approach to academics. It would not be uncommon to find me in a computer lab procrastinating until 2:30am, ordering a pizza, and then finally doing my assignment. Despite spending hours constantly procrastinating or gaming, I always told myself “I didn’t have the time to workout” because I was constantly behind on schoolwork.   This led to a significant weight gain (I know, shocker!). But I got better at games - which was all I really cared about.  **Post-Graduation**  When I graduated I weighed about 215lbs. I gained more than 40 pounds while in my 4 years at school.  Now that I had graduated and had a full-time job, I ‘said’ enough is enough and tried to refine some of my bad habits. I cut out major diet offenders. No more late night pizza orders. No more soda or energy drinks. Yes I’d still frequently eat junk food for dinner and didn’t track my calories, but I forced myself to at least eat a healthier lunch.  And I began running. God this sucked at first. I remember I couldn’t run a single damn mile. Not even close. I was wheezing and drooping in sweat in less than a half-mile. But I just kept going to a local park after work and made running part of my routine.  Gradually the distance increased substantially.  All these new habits took me a long way. I lost quite a bit of weight (at least 20lbs). I was feeling good about it. Eventually even tried on my old suit and my crazy long sleeves made me feel like one of those inflatable ‘arm flailing’ tube men that you see in front of grand openings. Success (or so I thought).  But eventually the progress stopped. The weight loss halted. It happened because it got harder and I wasn’t actually pushing myself. I wasn’t really trying.  And I also still poured almost every free moment I had into video games...  **From Gaming to Fitness**  This section probably won’t make any sense to anyone who doesn’t play competitive video games so you can SKIP this section and jump to ‘EPIPHANY’ if that’s not your cup-of-tea.  But failing to get promoted into Diamond league in League of Legends might’ve been one the best things that ever happened to me. Let me attempt to explain.  I was not just a casual gamer. I always strived to be competitive. I always wanted to be the best (or at least constantly getting better). I was addicted to seeing myself improve. In order to make that happen, I developed a sense of discipline and practice that helped me to climb decently fast. I won’t pretend I was a League ‘God’ or anything. There are many better players than me. But I eventually climbed to top 2% in North America. I also co-launched and hosted a weekly podcast related to teaching people how to improve at the game (shoutout to anyone from Tforce/4wards who might be reading this) and I gave individual coaching/lessons. And that was all while working a full-time job with a 1.5hour commute, often playing half as many ranked games as many of my similarly-ranked peers.  Now I attribute my rapid climb to my discipline & focus combined with my ‘drive.’ No matter how high I climbed, I was a constant student of the game. I learned from watching Korean pro players who were way better than me. I’d spend hours breaking down what they did to be successful and trying to apply it to my own play. I constantly ‘drilled’ myself in somewhat repetitive tasks and game mechanics until it was almost sub-conscious to me. I regularly reviewed my play, or when I’d make mistakes and was very critical of myself because I wanted to get better.   And I climbed because…I wanted it. I wanted it bad. I worked really hard at it. I was driven. But as anyone who has played the game knows - many folks don’t truly care about their rank until the season is about to end. Until there’s a deadline that they have to address. That was me (remember I mentioned I was a procrastinator?).   At the very end of season 6 of league of legends, I decided to “push myself” to get into Diamond - but I had waited way too long to start. As the deadline approached, I dropped nearly everything else in my life to focus on climbing. I basically sat at my computer all day grinding games, practicing technique, or reviewing replays. Eat, sleep, game, repeat. I put in a ton of work and saw a tremendous amount of progress in a short period of time…  But...it didn’t happen. I ran out of time. The weekend before the season ended, I was a single victory away from winning a promotion series that would have granted me my coveted “diamond border” multiple times. But I didn’t make it. I was crushed.  Why do I mention this all this gaming nonsense? I swear it connects back to fitness. Here we go.  When I didn’t make it to Diamond, my first instinct was to get the climb out of the way early in Season 7. I was already practically there - so I thought “this will be a piece of cake.” With this mindset I became lazy. I cut a lot of corners that helped me to climb in the first place and eventually started falling in rank. I realized that if I wanted to see the type of progress I needed to climb quickly again - I was going to have to invest every ounce of my free time and energy into this game again…   …And then that thought filled me with dread.  **EPIPHANY** Wait. why? Why should I work so hard for this?   Now knowing how grueling my experience would be to get back to another Diamond promotion series with my old approach to the game - I asked myself - how could I possibly justify it? I would have to give up every free moment of my life to get a shiny border on a loading screen for internet bragging rights.   I decided that I’d be better off putting my time and efforts into something else. I hypothesized that if I put half as much effort into any other aspect of my life as I did trying to climb in video games - that I could see tremendous results. So I decided to test that theory…with fitness.   I then quit playing ranked league altogether, took a “before” photo - and then read the r/fitness wiki.  **Foray into fitness - 1 Year Ago** Many initial struggles. I was terrified of attempting compound lifting movements at they gym. But I also knew they were important. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on proper form and read a bunch of articles on diet. Most importantly - I read through the r/fitness wiki. Multiple times.  I settled on doing u/metallicadpa’s PPL routine. And I started counting my calories strictly.  * A month later - wow.  * 2 months and some beginner gains later - **Holy shit.** This actually works.   I realized that if you truly work at something with persistence and  discipline day-in and day-out - then the seemingly impossible suddenly becomes possible. And I was never the same again.  **Transforming my Life**  With all this extra time I had saved from not grinding video games - it quickly became apparent that I should pick up some new hobbies and practices.   I picked up rock climbing to stay active. I got back into playing guitar -which I hadn’t played in years. I pushed myself to be more social and outgoing after years of sitting inside a room playing games until 2am  nearly every evening. Soon my whole life felt very different.   Over the course of the next year: WORK - I got promoted, and also joined an awesome new team recently. They’re the best.  SOCIAL - I made new friends, re-kindled old friendships, and ‘hung out’ with people way more than when I was grinding games. I shifted from my narrow-minded self that was only concerned with video games, who struggled to relate to people —> to being genuinely interested in other people and their passions. It’s been a massive life-changer.  LIVING - I gradually transitioned from a recent college grad with student-loan debt living with his parents to an adult who is living debt-free in one of the most incredible cities in the world.   PRODUCTIVITY, PROCRASTINATION, & STRESS - I realized that a lot of the stress I had and procrastination could be avoided by applying proper discipline and planning. By writing things down and properly managing my time with discipline day-in and day-out, I often work half as hard as I used to and achieve 5-10x times the results in terms of productivity. I often think back on how much stress I had during school with procrastination, and I now think I could easily get way better grades with half the amount of ‘effort.’    TRAVEL - Last year I went on a two-week Euro-trip with my friends and it was one of the best experiences of my life. This [photo from Norway](https://imgur.com/a/mZD8ryD) has one of my best genuine smiles. I love doing active & outdoor activities now. I am planning to travel more in the coming months.  **A brief note regarding fitness, girls, and confidence:** A lot of people get into fitness to attract the opposite sex (or same sex). It was certainly a ‘motivating factor’ for me initially.  And yes - the gains have helped :)  But really, the added confidence I gained from smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, combined with developing a more broad range of hobbies & interests - did way more for my dating life than just fitness alone. If I just replaced my obsession with gaming with an obsession with fitness - I doubt I would be as happy as I am now.  **Looking forward** I’ve never really “bulked” before. I’m eager to see where I could be after a full bulk-cut cycle. But right now, fitness has taken a bit of a back-seat compared to some other priorities in my life. That said, I’m looking to start my first true ‘bulk’ sometime in the late fall, most likely November.   For now, I’ll continue my weekly ritual of eating at a deficit during the week so that I can enjoy the weekends without as much guilt and still say ‘somewhat’ lean. I’m probably not going to have a 6 pack at this rate (not willing to give up alcohol and other delicious weekend foods right now). Admittedly, that was a pretty hard pill to swallow initially but I’ve come to terms with it. That said, I lead a pretty active lifestyle and I don’t anticipate I’ll get too out of shape either. And then I’ll reign it all in and get ‘strict’ again once I start my bulk so it doesn’t get too out of control.  **Tips / advice that helped me** -**Read the wiki.** I know that this is beaten to death here, but seriously do it. It’s probably the most important thing related to fitness that I’ve ever read. -Consistency is everything. Fuck “motivation.” This is about consistently about getting your ass in the gym and watching your diet. Even on days when you really don’t want to. -Once you lose some weight - remember to buy new clothes that fit you. Seriously makes a big difference. -Meal prep on Sundays. Eat copious amounts of Chicken & Greek Yogurt. Drink plenty of Black Coffee.  **Special Thanks** -This community. Especially progress posters. You gave me the reinforcement I needed. Thank you. -Thanks to u/metallicadpa for writing the PPL program. -And special thanks to the mods who keep this place up and running  **Lastly I’ll just say this:** If you decide you want it bad enough, that’s literally all it takes. Fitness is not complicated.  There’s no magical barrier from preventing you from succeeding. Ignore any dumb voice or excuse in your head. It’s all bullshit.   Seriously, your results are yours, and they are there for the taking. Just start. ","This is the most relatable and thus motivating transformation story I've read on this site. Thank you for taking the time to articulate your thoughts and feelings and not just giving a passing, ""Well I did it and now I'm happier"". Fuck it. If you can do it. I can do it, too. ",2051

I started off with just 3 full body workouts a week and am now on PPL 6 day program, but using a form of 531 for my main lifts. **Routine:** I go to the gym usually 5 days a week running a 6-day PPL program but I just continue on the next week starting from the 6th day.  **DAY1: Push A** -Bench press 5 - 3 - 1 style, so reps change every week. -Overhead press 5 - 3 - 1. -Incline dumbbell press 3x8-12 -Seated lateral raise 4x12-15 -Weighted dips - 4x8 -OH Tricep extension 3x8-12  **DAY2: Pull** -Deadlifts 5-3-1 -Weighted Pullups 3x5 -Dumbell rows 3x8-12 -Facepulls 3x12-15 -EZ Bar curls 3x8-12 -DB Rear Delt Flies 3x12-15 -Hammer curls 3x8-12  **DAY3: Legs** -Squats 5-3-1 -Front squat 4x8 -Hip thrusts 4x8 -Leg Curl 4x8-12 -Calf raises 4-12-15 -Lunges 4x 8-12 The rest of the days are Push, Pull and legs again with some variation, doing lighter lifts and more reps for the main lifts. Don't want to make the post too long. I also do a decent amount of calisthenics training on the side with a long-term goal of full planche which I'm training for. **Supplements** I only use creatine nowadays, will start taking protein shakes when I have some more spare money **Diet** My diet is definitely one of the things that I need to improve on, I tracked my calories at the start but haven't in a while, until the other week where I have started again. For me, it's really hard to gain weight without tracking my calories properly.  **Ending words** I still want to gain a lot more weight until I am fully comfortable with how my body looks, I want to be around 160 lbs, I just want to stay lean. ","Wow. That’s some seriously incredible progress! Keep it up man, the sky’s the limit! ",326
8r8qwz,"Hey everyone, I'm here to share the results and the story of my past year of fitness. Hopefully through this post I can give whatever guidance or wisdom I have gained from this past year. [Here's the progress picture](https://i.imgur.com/RFNoM9p.png) It all started a year ago today when out of boredom over the summer, I decided to begin ""working out"" seriously. I use quotations because for the first **6 months** everything I did was highly misguided and I was largely just making things up as I went. In that first 6 months, I did a variety of ""routines"" of sorts but all were very similar so I will tell you the one I remember best (and the one I likely did for the longest). The routine was 7 days a week, on one day, I would use a veeeeeeeery old (and pretty disfuntional) [Bowflex Motivator 2 machine my parents had lying around](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41JP6BVW98L.jpg) for an upper body workout, which consisted of curls, benchpress, and rows with the machine, followed by curls and lateral raises with dumbbells. The next day I would do a ~30 minute ab routine followed by what was usually a 2.5 mile run (sometimes more, sometimes less). I gravitated toward running as I used to be a cross-country runner (quit after an injury) but in my case **doing what was comfortable to me was not what was best for me** as I will explain later. The one thing to remain constant across the entire year was my drinking of protein shakes, as my goal was to get larger and stronger. Now there are a lot of mistakes to unpack with what I spent half of the year doing, and I will try my best to go through and explain just why most of it was highly inefficient. First of all, and most importantly: **If you are major skeleton mode like I was at the start, and your goal is to gain weight and muscle, *DO NOT RUN.*** Or at least, do not run as frequently as I did as, unless you are eating significantly more on the days you run to balance it out, weight gain is going to be made quite a lot more difficult if you add in any type of cardio, but especially running. However, this is to be considered relative to your goals, if you were, for example, an athlete, there are many benefits to running and cardiovascular training, but in my case, I am not an athlete and my sole goals were strength and gaining weight, both of which running hindered rather than helped. Second, in any form of fitness, you should use the internet to research what kinds of things you should be doing for your specific goals, but especially if you are trying to workout at home with less gear than there would be at a gym, you better make sure what you are doing is efficiently training your body as there are a lot of ineffective ways to do it. One such ineffective method I put to use was the circuit setup of a workout, wherein instead of doing multiple sets of each exercise one at a time, you do multiple ""rounds"" of doing one set of each exercise. Just to be more clear I was doing something like Bench -> Row -> Curl -> Bench -> Row -> Curl, etc when I should have been doing Bench -> Bench -> Row -> Row -> Curl -> Curl. I'm not entirely certain on the specific benefit of the latter setup to the former, but I am fairly certain one of the main reasons I struggled to gain muscle in the first 6 months was my use of a circuit rotation, which I found hardly ever even made me sore. It was not until December 26, 2017 that I got a gym membership, and I believe it was then that I really started to get serious about my goals. Once I had a gym membership I stopped running altogether, started drinking protein shakes twice a day and really began trying my best to ""bulk up."" Around mid January I picked the program that I would be on even up to now (though I am currently considering switching to another program). My program was [Metallicadpa's PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?st=jdodcv98&sh=8771b4ba) which I found here on this reddit page. While I don't have any experience with any other programs, I do highly recommend this one for people like me who want to get stronger and larger and are willing to go to the gym 6 days per week. Here were my starting stats: * Deadlift: 95lbs x 5 reps * Squat: 100lbs x 5 reps (note here: Early on my squats were definitely too shallow, took me about 2 weeks to realize, I believe that is the main reason my squat was heavier than my deadlift at the start) * Bench: 75lbs x 5 reps * Overhead Press: Couldn't even get 1 rep on the bar, did dumbbells to work up to it Note here that despite my **6 months** of ""training"" prior to this, my lifts still seemed very much like that of an untrained beginner. I believe this highlights the significance of all the mistakes I previously mentioned. However, that is not to say I believe what I did in those 6 months did not help me, they were very important to me. First of all, the first 6 months I'm sure in some way did make me stronger, and certainly larger (I gained somewhere between 10 and 15 pounds in that time). But the most significant part of the first 6 months was that it helped me form the habit of exercise. Not once since going to the gym have I ever felt unmotivated or had I day were I just didn't feel like it. There are a variety of factors that may have lead to this attitude but I would like to believe a significant contributor was the fact that I had already formed the habit, so it was something my mind and body were already used to. Current stats: * Deadlift: 205lbs x 5 reps * Squat: 170lbs x 5 reps * Bench: 120lbs x 5 reps * Overhead Press: 80lbs x 5 reps While all my advice so far has been very technical, I'd like to conclude with some more motivational and abstract wisdom to everyone reading. Even if it is not fitness related, I believe everyone can find a constructive hobby. For me, weightlifting was the perfect hobby, I love the feeling of working out and as an avid video game player, I can appreciate the grind of it. For you, maybe exercise isn't quite so pleasant, but I do encourage you to find some other way you can both enjoy, and better yourself. I believe hobbies like these are very important for mental, and in my case physical, health. For me, lifting helped me through what was probably the most stressful part of my life so far (junior year of high school with 5 AP classes). I believe everyone can find a hobby that they can use to take their mind off things and just enjoy the moment. **If you read nothing else in this post, I hope you read this bit on motivation** Personally I have found the most important factor in motivation is appreciating the progress you have made. It is very easy to get caught up in the never ending pursuit of improvement, but it is very important every now and then to look back and realize how far you have come (such as in this reddit post). There was a post on r/getmotivated a few days ago that I feel encapsulates this idea pretty well, it was the following quote: ""Remember when you wanted what you have now."" This quote hit me especially hard, as even though I still currently hope to become larger and stronger than I am, I have to realize that over the past year, I have already become larger and stronger than I was. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I hope something of what I said helped you in some way. EDIT: WOW! Posted this before going to sleep and woke up to 100+ comments and 1k+ upvotes. There are far too many positive comments for me to thank each individually so I just wanted to say a sincere thank you to everyone. Honestly I was somewhat reluctant to even make this post, by the time I finished I thought there would be no way anyone would have taken the time to read the whole thing through, but by that point I had invested so much time I just posted it anyway. Again thank you to everyone and just as a final reminder: I'm just a regular dude, and any of you can change yourself just as I have if you put your mind to it. Even I had my doubts when I started but if you take anything away from this post I hope it's this: Don't let anything stop you. ","Wow, you look incredible and grew a ton. Great work! I would say keep bulking!",243
8rtgw8,"EDIT: Title says 26 but needs to be 25. Ok this blew up more than expected. I already replied to some but I have to go now. I'll try to reply to everyone when I get back home! &nbsp; Hi all, I'm making this post because I want to show what /r/fitness has done for me and that even the worst cases of skinnyfatness are curable. There are undoubtedly more impressive progress posts out there, but when I searched to find stories like mine to find inspiration to keep me going, I found none. That's why I wanted to write it all down: so that other ""true"" skinnyfat people can see that you can actually shake it off (not literally, although you could probably lose it by dancing too). &nbsp; ### Background **TL;DR:** **07/2016:** 23/M/5'11/168lbs (1m80/76kg) **06/2018:** 25/M/5'11/168lbs (1m80/76kg) I know the dates say that it took 2 years, but it actually didn't. It's just the time in between the first and current picture. I just cruised for 8-9 months after my first ""cut"" (wasn't really a cut, more on that later) because I was pretty content. All in all, it took a bit over 1 year. &nbsp; [Pictures](https://i.imgur.com/EuLMb0P.jpg) (every picture is taken right after waking up. No pump and no food). I was fat at 210lbs/95kg (no picture), then skinnyfat at 168lbs/76kg, then skinny at 152lbs/69kg, bulked up to 174lbs/79kg and cut back down to 168lbs/76kg.  Originally I had 3 goals: lose the tits, lose the love handles and get abs. I have mild gyno so I'll probably never completely lose the moobs and all my fat goes to my lower back and lower abs so I probably won't lose my love handles until I am sub 10% body fat. The gyno and lower back fat are not really visible in the pictures (long live the nipple twist and loose fitting underwear), but they're still there (although they're maybe 10% of their original size). This is not my endstation but I'm happy with my progress. &nbsp; **Full story** ***EDIT: holy fuck this turned out longer than I wanted. There's no vital info or tips in here, just my story so you don't have to read this unless you're actually interested. Scroll down to ""lift progress"" if you aren't.*** &nbsp; *Intro* I warned you. For the majority of my life (10 y/o & onwards) I have always been ""the fat kid"". At around 18 years old, standing at roughly 210lbs (95kg), I had enough. Over the course of 2 years and a bit of yo-yo'ing, I dropped down to 168lbs (76kg). I hung around that weight for another year but still wasn't anywhere near a body I could be happy with. I was unhappy and bordering on depression. I'm pretty pear shaped (small shoulders, small lats, wide and high hips combined with a smaller waist, heavy legs). As a matter of fact, I think I was supposed to be a pear and got changed to be a human at the last second before being put on earth. Being skinnyfat didn't help. Then, one summer I went to a place with lots of fit and attractive people. That's when I had enough. Again. I thought ""if all these people can be fit, I can be fit too"". It was the proverbial drop in the bucket and finally mustered up the courage to start the ""road"" (for lack of a better word) to curing my skinnyfatness (paired with general unhappiness). I knew /r/fitness existed, but I never visited it. This changed and I started reading more and more, abusing the subs search function. Eventually I stumbled onto the the wiki which contained all the info I needed and off I went.  &nbsp; *Cut 1: not really a cut* [START](https://i.imgur.com/fnv0b9g.jpg) JULY 2016: There were 3 options: cut, recomp or bulk. Recomping was out of the question pretty fast because it is pretty slow and I feared that that me being new to all this I would likely just be spinning my wheels. I didn't want to bulk either because I'd only get fatter.  So I started a cut. It was 80% diet, 15% cardio and 5% lifting, so not really a ""cut"" and more a ""dieting down"" to be honest. I didn't want to fork out the money for a gym membership and due to previous experiences, the gym wasn't appealing to me. I just did a little routine at home 3x per week (more on that in ""lift progress""). At this point, I haven't heard about MyFitnessPal so I made my own [spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/mPqzViZ) and [database](https://imgur.com/ROsZred) (these are just snippets). I used this during the entirety of my cut (I'm just going to call it cut from now on because it's easier). I ""officially"" started the 27th of July 2016 and took a month break from mid October until mid november. Then I picked it up again until 28th of December. [END](https://i.imgur.com/5bRFm0a.jpg) &nbsp; *Contently cruising* New year rolled around and by the time I was pretty happy with where I was. Still living the pear-life but I had abs for the first time in my life. This continued until around July 2017 (coincidentally right around the same event that got me started the year before) when I noticed that in my mind the ""you're skinny"" comments stopped registering as compliments and more and more as ""you're too skinny"". So I decided I'd like to have some more muscle on me.  I also started to feel too weak (literally). It's really confronting when you come to the conclusion you're not the fat-but-strong guy any more because you're not fat any more. &nbsp; *Bulk 1: the wild ride* [START](https://i.imgur.com/PAzjs17.jpg) July 2017: Bulk. It can't be that hard. Just eat 250-500 above your TDEE and gain no more than 2lbs per month. Let's do this (with MyFitnessPal this time). Fuck me sideways, I was wrong. The first month and a half I went up 10lbs. I could not figure out what was happening. I was eating what I was supposed to be eating and tracking correctly (cross-checked MFP with my own spreadsheet). Then, all of the sudden the weight gained stopped. Not tapered down, just flat out stopped. I still don't know what the fuck happened (could it be water retention from eating at such a low intake before and just more food in my stomach and bowels?), but I looked about the same so no big deal. I just continued.  I also play sports, so due to the variations in the amount of training/games and intensity of said training/games it was very hard to consistently gain about 2lbs per month. Some months I gained 1lbs, some months I gained 4lbs. I retained some outline of my abs while increasing strength, so I wasn't too worried. The highest number I saw on my scale was 176 lbs (79.9kg), but the trend ""only"" gave 174lbs (79kg), so I'm rolling with that as official ""end weight"". [END](https://i.imgur.com/Ie1rznR.jpg) &nbsp; *Cut 2: a proper cut* MARCH 2018: I graduated and got a job. An active one. 3 months until summer and an active job, so no better time than then to start cutting. Lowered my intake gradually over the course of 3 months, while taking a 2 week break in the middle. People here often say ""bulk until you hate yourself, cut until you hate life"". I always thought the phrase was just for a laugh and because it's catchy, but I now realise it really isn't. I could lose a bit more fat (especially lower abs and lower back), but I'm absolutely 100% done for now. I think I'm a bit leaner than when I was 152lbs/69kg and hovering around 14-15% body fat. [END](https://i.imgur.com/mrbBlHp.jpg) &nbsp; ### Lift Progress I know I'm still nowhere near ""strong"", but I think I made some pretty good progress so far. All lifts stayed the same during my cut up until last week. **Squat**  Start 110lbs x 4 (50kg x 4) Current  231lbs x 4 (105kg x 4) **Bench Press** Start 100lbs x 4 (45kg x 4) Current  182lbs x 4 (82.5kg x 4) **Deadlift** Start 176lbs x 4 (80kg x 4) Current  315lbs x 6 (142.5kg x 6) **Overhead Press**  Start 60lbs x 4 (27.5kg x 4) Current  127lbs x 4 (57.5kg x 4) &nbsp; During the first cut I did a stupid little self-made routine because I didn't want to go to a gym. It basically consisted of 3x33+1 decline sit-ups, 3x1 minute elbow planks (normal and side), 3x10 EZ bar curls, 3x10 tricep pushdowns and sometimes 3x10 DB rows if I felt like it. I didn't do any lifting during my cruising period. When I decided I wanted to go to the gym and bulk, I had a lot of time so I wanted a routine that made use of that. I also wanted a routine with lots of shoulder and chest work and I didn't want to go more than 3 days per week to the gym. I also read you should train in different rep ranges and you need both vertical and horizontal pulling. After a bit of reading a searching around, I picked [lvysaur's 4-4-8](https://i.imgur.com/SKruJBF.png) and I didn't regret it for a single moment. Bench and OHP everyday, varying rep ranges, high-rep deadlifts, chin-ups, ... It fit all the requirements. I still don't get why it doesn't get mentioned more. The only thing I did was add some core work and face pulls + lat raises (alternating every gymday) and dialed back the progression a bit in the end. Around mid december I switched to 5/3/1 BBB because I felt my linear gains were starting to run out (in hindsight it might have been because I didn't eat enough) and I was ready to commit to 4 days per week. Did a couple of cycles until I started my cut in March. When I started my cut, I tried continuing 5/3/1 BBB but ended after 1 cycle. I switched to GZCL The Rippler but, while it's a perfectly fine program, I didn't really like it. It took around the same time as 5/3/1 BBB (maybe even a bit longer) but I felt I was doing less. Also, I don't like the very low rep sets (1-2 reps per set). I ended up switching to 5/3/1 Triumvirate+FSL, which I am still doing now. &nbsp; ### Diet **Food** I'm 100% convinced I have a slower-than-average metabolism. During my first cut I averaged around 1700kcal and lost about 1 lbs (0.45kg) per week. I did at least 3x per week cardio (1x HIIT, 1 training, 1 game). 1700kcal is very low for a 5'11 168lbs male, but such is life. During my bulk I started at 2600kcal while blowing up 10lbs. Didn't know what the fuck I had to do so I dialled it back to ~2400 kcal but kept on gaining like a I was getting ready for hibernation. When I finally stopped gaining, I gradually upped my intake every couple of weeks and ended up around 3100kcal (I gained a little bit too fast for my liking at 3100kcal to I dialled it back a bit to 2900-3000kcal). I started my second cut back at 2400kcal, but I wasn't losing any weight (nor was I gaining). 2300. Nothing. 2200. Nothing. Again, no fucking clue why it didn't budge. I wasn't gaining at 2600 earlier, not I'm not losing at 2200. Blows my mind. Anyway, I gradually reduced until I started seeing the scale move. This started at around 2100kcal and now I'm at 1800kcal. I'm now at a point where it's mentally very hard and I'm struggling to get myself to the gym, let alone performing decently which is a red flag for me. I'm ending it here. &nbsp; **Macros** - 160-180g protein. - 70g fat (I often don't make this number, its closer to 50) - rest are carbs Classic IIFYM diet. Chicken, swedish quark, dark bread, rice, potatoes and eggs are my staple foods. I eat the same things almost everyday because it's easy and I don't mind. &nbsp; **Supplements** Zinc, Vit D and Magnesium. Because they all showed up to be defeicient or on the low side according to my blood tests. No creatine or protein shakes. No creatine because I didn't feel like I needed it and because of the supposed links with male pattern baldness (rather be safe than sorry) and no protein shakes because I get sufficient protein from food. **EDIT:** added macros and suplements &nbsp; ### Optional **Future Goals** I'm not where I want to end yet, but I'm happy with my progress so far. I could still lose a couple of pounds of fat, but I'd rather gain a bit more muscle & strength first. I think I'm gonna do 6 week bulk (the length of 2 5/3/1 cycles) & 2-3 week cut cycles and see how it goes. Also, I'm going to switch back to 5/3/1 BBB, still focussing on lats and shoulders because they're still my weak point (fucking genetics man). &nbsp; **In conclusion** I'd like to say the following: /r/fitness is often criticized (mainly by /r/fitness itself) but I don't think you lot realise (especially the ones that are very active) how much you can change peoples lives (mine for example). So much actual knowledge bunched up in this subreddit (if you know where and how to look). You'd have to read countless books and take a metric ton of courses to get close to what you can read here in just a few clicks. **All for free.** A genuine thank you to everyone who contributes in here.

8s0nze,"34/F 368 lbs starting, currently at 183lbs I’ve been overweight most of my life. From elementary school on, I was pudgy and it only got worse. In high school/college, I was heavier, but still at a manageable weight. It seems I have the metabolism of a sloth. I tried going to a nutritionist in college and it was actually a very awful experience, I tried a liquid diet, nothing worked. Eventually got married to someone who was more unhealthy than myself and I clocked in at 368 lbs.  January 1, 2012, I decided I wanted to lose weight. I thought it would make my marriage better so we did it together and by December 31, I had lost 100+ lbs. The first 8 months, I just ate healthy and calorie restricted. Then I incorporated walking and got a personal trainer who came to my house and did strength training. At this point, my ex husband decided he no longer wanted to “keep trying to lose weight.” I felt so good, I decided that I was doing it for me, not my marriage, and powered on.  I never had a goal weight initially, just to lose some weight. It never occurred to me that I wouldn’t always be plus size so when I could shop at regular stores, I was so excited and kept going. By mid-2013, I was weighing in around 200 lbs and set a goal of weighing 150 lbs by my 30th birthday (December 2013). I got in to spin classes and other group workouts and they really helped me reach my goals.  I hit 150 (218 lbs lost) early December. Went to Vegas to celebrate said birthday and honestly have never weighed 150 since. It was an unhealthy goal for me. I put some weight back on and off and gained quite a bit of muscle and now bounce between 175-185. I have a bit of skin to deal with and will always be a thicker girl, but I’m mostly happy with it all now.  How did I do it? Meticulously counting calories. Cut out 95% of alcohol for the first 1.5 years. No specific other dietary restrictions and built in calories for chocolate, etc. when I had a sweet tooth. I did track everything in an app. I was neurotic about weighing and measuring portions. I researched healthy ways to dine out and ways to minimize calorie intake (custom ordering salads, etc.) I had to be very careful as I travel almost weekly for work and meal prep is difficult. For those who travel, I have tons of recommendations.  Moderate exercise to start then anywhere around 1-1.5 hours per day of cardio in later months. I would go to a spin class in the AM and then do a moderate walk on treadmill in the afternoons. Picked up spinning, running, cycling, etc. I developed rigorous training scheduled for biking distances and distance running. A lot of self motivation was required.  Things I’ve done since I lost the weight (and would have never dreamed about): 1. 3 half marathons + various other races 2. Biked a century ride down through Big Sur and Highway 1 3. Tried rock climbing and repelling 4. Hiking Zion, Yosemite, Great Wall of China and various other things.  5. Wore a bikini (this is still not fun)  Posting this today because I need some motivation. My partner and I have started a fairly strict keto diet partially to lose some fat but more so because there is some literature that it may help improve fertility which I’m struggling with. I don’t really feel like being on a strict diet again and counting macros, but I know it’s 100% worth it if it works.

8skhqu,"Well...here it is...https://imgur.com/a/xw1rqB8 I occasionally post progress pictures on IG if you'd like to follow me - @austin.sure Started at 275lbs and now down to 170! Here's the breakdown of how this actually went down. To begin, this picture is from when I had already lost 50 pounds (so around 210-220). The first 50 pounds was lost 100% through using a keto diet paired with strict calorie counting. I kept my daily calorie intake around 1400-1600 per day and it took approximately 4 months to shed the first 50 pounds. Again, no exercise was used, barely even walks around the neighborhood. The next 50-60 pounds, I decided I'd like to speed things up a bit so I implemented running around my neighborhood paired with some light dumbbell training. Mainly just 15 pound dumbbells and different variations of chest presses, curls, tricep extensions, etc. This got me all the way down to 160 pounds. Now was the time to actually build up muscle and by this point I was 3 years into the process. So for the last 5 years I've kept the same workouts and have progress. I have been running PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training). It's a 5 day a week workout program that I stuck to religiously and over the past 5 years I can count on both my hands the amount of workouts I actually missed. Instead of typing out the workout, I used this spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z88d0BCV7jDOyPouLc5TzYjAqY9u_p8ZnTmDkaABACE/edit#gid=0 I have gone through 5 years of bulking and cutting cycles and have finally reached the body I want. If anyone has any questions about any of my struggles along the way, please reach out and I'll try my hardest to help! As for diet, it was strictly an IIFYM approach. I did this 100% through calorie counting!!! No BS fad diets or anything. I ate what I wanted, when I wanted, but as long as I was under my caloric goals for the day (around 1600-1800 for cutting, 2800-3000 for bulking) I always saw results.

The main two pictures are taken exactly 1 year apart & I have added a few pictures during the end of my bulk.  http://imgur.com/a/ut9VaDc Before I took the gym seriously, I tried adding size by following a bro split and ate as much calories as I could. That lasted for 3 months and led to minimal results . Afterwards I downloaded MyFitness pal, watched a bunch of videos on training, tracked my marcos and started seeing steady progress! The STATS @5'11, 20yo (176>158>184>161lbs in 1 year span) Started at 178lbs, 17-18%bf First cut finished at 158lbs, ~12% bf First Bulk ended at 184lbs, 16-18%bf Second cut done at 161lbs, ~12%bf Lifts/stats: 155B/105S/225D - June 24, 2017  250B/250S/350D - June 24, 2018 TRAINING: I followed a PPL program for the whole year, adding cardio only for my cutting phases ( 1 - 1.5 hour training sessions). Each workout had 3-4 exercises dedicated to each muscle group. 2 big compound movements and the rest isolate. 3-4 sets each exercise and aimed at the 8-12 rep range. An example of my PPL program:  DAY 1 Bicep/Back/Rear Delt: 3 x 8 back rows 3 × 8 lat pull downs  3 x 10 seated single arm rows 4 x 10 dumbell shrugs 4 x 10 single arm dumbell curls 3 x 8 heavy barbell curl 3 x 8 Reverse fly machine DAY 2 Chest/Tricep/Front delt: 3 x 8 flat Dumbell bench press 3 x 8 incline dumbell bench press 3 x 8 cable flys 3 x 12 Dips 3 x 12 Tricep pull downs 3 x 8 skull crushers  3 x 8 shoulder press 3 x 8 dumbbell delt flys  DAY 3 Legs + abs:  4 x 8 Squats 3 x 8 heavy lunges 3 x 12 leg extensions 3 x 12 hamstring curls 4 x 12 calf raises  4 x 12 heavy cable ab crunchs 3 x 12 ab roller REST * REPEAT* Cardio : 20 mins treadmill or stairmaster at 8-12km/h. This was done on Push and Pull days , 4 times a week during my Cut. DIET: I tracked my marcos daily and followed IIFYM. With the help from MyFitness pal, I was able to input all my meals and stay on the right path. During the year my calories ranged from 1700 cals (final Cut) to 3600 cals (peak Bulk). Marco % for Bulk: 50C 30P 20F Marco % during Cut: 30C 35P 35F My bulk phase involved eating entire pizzas and binging on McDonalds to reach my calorie surplus . I added protein bars and whey protein shakes to keep my intake at 1 gram/Lb Body weight. On my Cut , I gave up all junk food and stuck to daily meal prepping. This also included cutting out bread, pasta & white rice. Chicken breasts, veggies and protein shakes were the main foods I consumed on my caloric defict. I drank 2L+ of water and 1-3 cups of black coffee daily. I found this to suppress my appetite and allow me to focus on my diet. 1-3 Quest bars daily was my secret weapon for snacking while completing my fiber intake. SUPPLEMENTS:  Whey protein, quest protien bars and muscle milk was used daily to reach my protein goals. I have not tried creatine yet but will definitely try this fall. Pre workout was used before most gym sessions but lately I've been getting serious rashes from the powder PreWorkouts. Ive tried multiple ones, mr hyde, c4, mammoth pump etc. but have come with the side effects. So I've switched to black coffee while I've been cutting and sometimes used a zero Cal energy drink for the caffeine boost.  FUTURE goals The First year of training has left me hungry for greater results. I plan to improve my pathetic squats to 300+, hit 315 on bench and deadlift 450.  If anyone has questions regarding my diet/training I am happy to answer in the comments! :) -almost6feet ",REGILOUSLY,820
8u28g4,"##**TL/DR - [Before and after](https://i.imgur.com/9VZ1z6u.jpg)** Hey reddit! Reading other redditor's transformation posts gave me the inspiration I needed to stick with my own transformation early on. As time goes by, I often wonder what happened to those people about whom I read and whether or not they stuck with fitness. It's possible to imagine that these transformation stories are instances of short-lived motivation that simply peters out. The purpose of this post is to show you that the transformation process can be sustainable if done correctly. Since my last post, I've continued to bodybuild and began competing in powerlifting. [This was my original transformation post from four years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/21yvse/my_3_year_transformation_from_clinically_obese/) ---  ## **Stats/Progress** --- **Sex:** Male **Age:** 30 **Height:** 5'10"" **2010:** [240lbs](https://i.imgur.com/8tCqN.jpg) **2013:** [160lbs](http://i.imgur.com/CQtMdX7.png) **2014:** [165lbs](https://imgur.com/5qPbxJR) **2016** [170lbs](https://i.imgur.com/YuxGKQK.jpg) **2017** [180lbs](https://i.imgur.com/kYRzwQa.png) **2018 (now):** [175lbs](https://i.imgur.com/YxQJyL0.jpg) [current legs](https://i.imgur.com/x2Ybouj.jpg) --- ## **Recap of the journey** --- * In 2010, I was [extremely obese and sick of it.](https://i.imgur.com/8tCqN.jpg) * I started dieting and doing cardio and got [very skinny](http://i.imgur.com/CQtMdX7.png). * At some point during my weightloss, I started lifting and [put on some muscle](http://i.imgur.com/wDZdndH.jpg). * After the weightloss, [I had a bunch of extra skin](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png). * I had the surgery to [remove the excess skin](http://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg). * I began to really enjoy the process of transforming my body and did [my first bodybuilding show in 2014](https://imgur.com/5qPbxJR). --- ## **How I did it: Training and Diet** ---  ###Training * After doing my last bodybuilding show, I was a little burnt out on the extreme dieting so I gave powerlifting a shot. * I competed in the 83KG division at a local meet. * I totaled 1,132 lbs. Not a great total, but it was a fun experience.    * [Deadlifting 462lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5IZ4fC-EXE)    * [Squatting 375lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzriS6BsaiI)    * [Benching 295 lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffFY51MgMMc) * To prepare for the meet, I utilized a training protocol known as [5/3/1 Big But Boring.](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101077382-boring-but-big) * I trained four days a week with the following training days:    * Day One       * Press – 5/3/1       * Press – 5 sets of 10 reps       * Lat work – 5 sets of 10 reps    * Day Two       * Deadlift – 5/3/1       * Deadlift – 5 sets of 10 reps       * Abs – 5 sets    * Day Three       * Bench Press – 5/3/1       * Bench Press – 5 sets of 10 reps       * Lat work – 5 sets of 10 reps    * Day Four       * Squat – 5/3/1       * Squat – 5 sets of 10 reps       * Abs – 5 sets * [Here is a template to utilize the 5/3/1 protocol.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eVpZVso86a4C5ZqcdQzYWGD_DpZF6wgwbeZzp9GZ21s/edit#gid=1298676863)  ###Macros * My goal for all of this is sustainability. Sure it's possible to get shredded through a juice fast, but what good is that if you just bounce back one week after you're finished dieting. This is where counting macros comes in. * Counting macros is a sustainable way to create a flexible diet that you can stay on no matter what circumstances life throws at you. * When I say counting macros, I mean to eat in a strategic way of fullfilling specific macronutrient goals. The types of food are not important, only the macronutrient profile of those foods matter. * To track the macronutrient profile of the foods I ingest, I use [My Fitness Pal for iphone](https://www.myfitnesspal.com) along with a food scale when it's available. When a food scale is not available, I will approximate my intake based on prior experience with the scale. * To learn how to count macros, I suggest watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me_s_U-xzQY) * To calculate my macros, I will do the following process:    * To start a cut or bulk, I use [IIFYM's macro calculator](https://www.iifym.com/iifym-calculator/). This will give me a caloric goal to achieve my specified weight-loss or weight-gain objective.    * Once I have my caloric intake goal clarified, I create a macronutrient profile for that caloric intake.    * I determine my macro-nutrient profile by first accounting for my protein of which I try to intake at least 1 gram per lb of bodyweight. For me currently that's 175g protein.    * Then, I calculate my fat intake of which I prefer a higher amount, sometimes as high as 40&#37; of my caloric intake. Currently that's 100 grams of fat.    * However many calories remain will go to carbohydrates.    * Once I have my calories and macros set, I adjust them to fit my needs. I mostly add and subtract from carbs. For cutting, I aim for a caloric deficit that will result in 1lb/week loss. For bulking, I aim for a caloric surplus that will result in a .5lb/week increase in bodyweight. To maintain, I aim for a caloric goal that will result in neither weight gain nor weight loss.    * My current macros [for this cut](https://i.imgur.com/YxQJyL0.jpg) are as follows       * 2,300 calories       * 175 grams protein       * 100 grams fat       * 175 grams carbs ###Intermittent Fasting * While macros alone allow some flexibility in my diet, intermittent fasting increases that flexibility to the point where a diet doesn't feel like dieting. * With my caloric goal and macros determined through the process shown above, I fit those macros into a specified eating window. * By fasting in the morning and only eating in a limited time-period, I can eat foods that may not seem to be ""diet friendly."" * Throughout this most recent cut, I have been utilizing the [16:8 IF protocol](https://www.liftlearngrow.com/blog-page/what-is-intermittent-fasting). * I fast in the morning and eat large meals when I finally break my fast. By combining Macros and Intermittent Fasting, I can remain on a diet even when I'm eating out or at a family gathering. --- ## **Motivation and staying with it** ---  * I still get private messages from my original posts. The most common question I get is ""How do you motivate yourself?"" * Although it seems like a simple question, it's actually very difficult to answer. I don't know how I motivated myself to begin doing any of these things. However, I do know what has helped me continue doing them. * I've distilled my process down to **2 key points.** ###1. Habit * I currently go to the gym upon waking. Sometimes I'm not even fully awake until I'm in my car, on my way to the gym. My point with that is, I don't even think about it. It takes zero motivation because it's just my routine. I've created a habit and now it's just what I do. * I see it like how when I was a little kid, I didn't want to brush my teeth or wash my hands. After my mom made me do these things for a while, I stopped complaining. Now, many years later, I brush my teeth and wash my hands without even thinking about it because the habit was instilled in me long ago. Fitness can be the same. * Section off one hour of your day, every day, to go to the gym. At first it's difficult but after doing it for a while, it will become a habit and begin to be effortless. The same can be done with counting macros. ###2. Interest * I do what's enjoyable. I can only make it so far with brute force. At some point, I have to actually like what I'm doing. * If I had to do an hour of cardio everyday to stay fit, I wouldn't be able to do it. I hate cardio. * I found I enjoyed training for bodybuilding so I did that for a while. Then bodybuilding training got boring to me so I switched to powerlifting. If this gets boring, I will switch to something else, like crossfit. * The key point is to keep it interesting. Very few people possess the kind of willpower required to consistently do something that is not enjoyable. --- I owe a great deal of gratitude to this subreddit for giving me the tools I used to transform my life. These tools are not limited to diet and exercise strategies but also the success stories that provided me the inspiration I needed early on to keep pushing for my own goals. I couldn't have done this without you all. To show my gratitude, I want to give back what I got. I hope this post can provide some inspiration and knowledge to help anyone who is in a similar place I was. ---  I'm open to answer any questions you may have about any of this. I will also reply to all DMs. Edit: I do not use steroids. Only whey protein, preworkout, and multivitamin/fishoil. ##**TL/DR - [Before and after](https://i.imgur.com/9VZ1z6u.jpg)**","Jonah Hill to Robert Downey Jr, noice",447
8wlkav,"# Background 2 years ago I was unhappy with my body, so I wandered into the gym with the simple goal of losing weight. I had no knowledge of fitness or nutrition, and I was weak and skinny fat. As someone who previously hated exercise, to the point that walking downstairs was sometimes a little too much effort, I never thought I would end up falling in love with fitness, and learning so much; but [here we are today](https://i.imgur.com/pmyL9Jz.jpg)! Throughout the past two years I've learnt a lot, and I hope to share with you the things I wish I knew at the start. --- # The Beginning (3 July 2016) Pics: [Front](https://i.imgur.com/b4aicP5.jpg) / [Back](https://i.imgur.com/T4kNsUx.jpg) Weight: 51kg / 113lbs **Exercise** I joined the gym and got a free session with a PT. My routine was cardio, cardio and more cardio. From the top of the Stairmaster I could see the free weight area, which looked a lot more fun than walking up infinite steps. The free weights area was dominated by big scary men and I wasn't ready to cluelessly wander in and make a fool of myself. I looked on reddit and youtube and learnt the basics. Then, armed with my YouTube powerlifting lessons, I entered the free weights area and managed to squat 40kg, deadlift 30kg and bench the bar... *just* ! (Most likely with awful form) **Diet** Around the same time, I discovered CICO (Calories in : Calories out). I cut my calories to 1000/day. I'd say it worked miracles for my weight loss but it's not a miracle, it's science and discipline - sounds cheesy but if I've learnt anything over these 2 years it's to forget all the pseudo science, fad diets and tips from gym bro's. Nothing works but science and discipline.    --- # The 2 Years # [My progress from day 1 to now](https://i.imgur.com/uBxGtSd.jpg).  ---  # July 2016 (113lbs/51kg) - Sept 2016 (109lbs/49kg) **Exercise** My routine and diet throughout these months are regretful, but it was all a learning experience. Weight loss and aesthetics were my only goals. I designed a body part split based on exercises I had seen recommended on YouTube. Weekday | Exercise (All done on a 3x12 rep scheme) ---|--- **Monday** (Cardio)|  45 mins cycling, 15 minutes stairmaster **Tuesday** (Chest, Arms) | DB bench press, Cable flys, bicep curls, hammer curls, tricep extensions **Wednesday** (Back, Shoulders) | DB rows, lat pull down, DB lateral raises, machine shoulder press **Thursday** (Legs, Chest) | Squat, deadlift, leg press, calf raises **Friday** (Arms) | DB bicep curls, DB hammer curls, DB kickbacks, cable tricep extentions  **Saturday** (Back, Shoulders) | DB rows, Pendlay rows, DB lateral raises, machine shoulder press **Sunday** (Rest) | Rest Although I gained strength, there was no planned progression and I certainly missed out on gains and progression because of it. I am an example of why new lifters should use a tried and tested programme, not a self made one. You don't know what you don't know.  **Diet**   I tried carb cycling and keto. Both of which I deem to be a waste of time. While they do have some scientific backing, and some people find the diets to be effective, I believe they're just complex ways to limit caloric intake, so it all comes down to CICO.  I discovered IIFYM and began tracking macros. I continued my caloric goal of 1000cals/day as that had already given me good results. I set my protein goal at 85g, as I read that you should consume a minimum of .85g of protein per lb of lean body mass. Macros: 100g carb, 25g fat, 85g protein ---  # October 2016 (99lbs/45kg) - February 2017 (123lbs/56kg) **Exercise**  I started following [nSuns PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?ref=share&ref_source=link), and my lifts progressed well.  My working weights progression from start to end: Deadlift 42.5kg > 53.75kg Squat 35kg > 43.75kg Bench 27kg > 31.25kg  Weekday & Session | Exercise (Add 2.5kg to compound lifts each session, acessories 3x12 unless stated otherwise) -----|--- Monday (Pull A) | 3x5 & 1x5+ deadlifts, lat pull down, seated row, 5x20 face pulls, 4x12 hammer curl, 4x12 DB curls, shrugs Tuesday (Push A) | 4x5 & 1x5+ bench press, OHP, incline DB press, tricep push down superset with 3x15 lateral raise (repeat with tricep extention), 3x15 rear delt fly Wednesday (Legs) | 2x5 & 1x5+ squat, RDL, leg press, leg curl, 5x12 calf raise Thursday (Pull B) | 4x5 & 1x5+ row, lat pull down, seated row, 5x12 face pull, 4x12 hammer curl, 4x12 DB curls, shrugs Friday (Push B) | 4x5 & 1x5+ OHP, bench pres, incline DB press, tricep push down superset with 3x15 lateral raise (repeat with tricep extention), 3x15 rear delt fly  **Diet** After the cut I felt awful; but I thought I looked great. I wanted to be stronger, so I started eating in a surplus. The main increase in calories came from protein in hopes of building more muscle.  Macros: 125 carb / 23 fat / 115 protein  # March 2017 (123lbs/56kg) - October 2017 (??kg) Between March and May-*ish* I was slowly cutting. I believe I dropped down to \~54kg but was only loosely tracking weight to keep my focus on strength. This is something I still do, and I believe it's the best way to avoid becoming weight-loss obsessed. From May to October I started a new job and had fallen into the trap of fuck-around-itis. My weight stayed mostly the same, with only minor strength improvements.  Macros: 120 carbs, 22 fat, 110 protein # November 2017 (??kg) - April 2018 (136lbs/62kg) **Exercise**  I switched to [nSuns 5/3/1 LP](http://archive.is/2017.01.27-015129/https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5icyza/2_suns531lp_tdee_calculator_and_other_items_all/). The volume and the 1RM sets were a big change, but it was great for powerlifting progression. Each session weight is added to the compound lifts dependant on how many reps are completed in the 1RM set.  Weekday | Compound Lifts (5/3/1 Rep scheme) & Accessories (3x8-12 Rep scheme) ---|--- Monday | Bench press, OHP, lat pull down, seated row, face pulls, reverse curls Tuesday | Squat, sumo deadlift, leg press, leg curl, calf raises  Wesnesday | OHP, incline bench, push ups, lateral raises, upright row Thursday | Deadlift, front squat, lat pull down, seated row, shrugs, reverse curls Friday | Bench press, C.G bench press, machine shoulder press, lateral raise, tricep extention My 1RM's: Deadlift - 125kg, Squat - 90kg, Bench - 60kg  **Diet** I started a *go hard-or-go-home-*bulk. Other than protein I did not track calories. My protein goal was 130g per day. I ate intuitively and had a good time. This is when I really started to enjoy powerlifting and getting strong - a liberating change from working out purely for aesthetics.  --- # The Now  [Currently 127lbs/58kg](https://i.imgur.com/pmyL9Jz.jpg) **Exercise** My 1RM's: Deadlift - 132.5kg, Squat - 90kg, Bench - 60kg I am still following nSuns 5/3/1, and still thoroughly enjoying it. I have maintained most of my strength from the bulk, and set a new deadlift PR. I have also completed Couch to 5k, something I thought I would never enjoy. Right now I think I am the fittest I have ever been.  **Diet** I have been taking a very relaxed approach to cutting weight in order to maintain my strength. It's amazing how much more I can eat to cut weight when compared to 2 years ago.  Macros: 145 carb, 40 fat, 125 protein I tend to eat the same thing every day, with the odd untracked treat every now and again.  --- # Summary It's now clear to me that the key to fitness is science and dedication. All of your goals can be achieved through those two things. However, if you want to live a healthy life, your lifestyle needs to be sustainable. Don't deny yourself food or a social life.   I know that my physique isn't to everyone's taste (some people are quite vocal) but I am happy and so much more confident in my body.  So thank you, /r/fitness, for the knowledge and guidance along the way!",Holy fuck you looking jacked as hell Respeck,1226
8wxu2u,I do mostly preacher curls and 21's for biceps but I want to add another accessory lift. Will pullups help grow my biceps or is there another more beneficial exercise? Edit: Hilarious typo is hilarious. Thanks for the serious answers. I'll incorporate chin ups and see if that works. Wont stop dong workouts either.,"Easily my most favorite typo thread title I've ever seen. And as others have said, try doing chin-ups instead if you want bicep growth.",1211
8z1pdd,I've started going with a calorie deficit diet a week ago and seeing my weight dropping makes me so motivated to lose so much more. I refused a lot of food just hoping to see the numbers dropping  is this a common thing or i need to be cautious  EDIT: Holy **** i didn't expect this post to explode. i wrote this just to get it off my chest because i was so motivated. im overwhelmed by the amount of people who can relate and who gave advice. I know it's mostly water weight or it's a lil too early to be so happy but I'm really just happy that i took this step to change my life. I will try to stay consistant and never give up until i reach my goal.,Just know where to stop and don't starve yourself for quick results because it's counter productive.,1415

92bhaj,"# Starting To Stretch Starting To Stretch is our own full-body flexibility program that was designed for r/flexibility beginners! It consists of 10 stretches divided into 2 equal parts (upper body and lower body). The focus of the program is on inflexible beginners and their typical needs: Shoulders, Thoracic Spine, Hips, Hamstrings, Wrists and Calves. Almost every of the exercises can be progressed to a specific skill if done long enough. **Follow Along: [You can follow along the whole routine with this video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVPyAU4l-sw)** **Cheat Sheet here: [.png](https://i.imgur.com/NtMb2cX.jpg) | [.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/us4yj3usf76teu2/sts.pdf?dl=0)** ## Programming Do this program 2-3 times a week! It will take ~30 minutes. If you have time issues, you can switch between upper and lower body. The stretching protocol is to be done in the following order. Try to go a little deeper each time after the bumping movements.  * Do 10 small gentle bumping movements into the stretch * Hold the stretch for 10 seconds * Do 10 small gentle bumping movements into the stretch * Hold the stretch for 20 seconds * Do 10 small gentle bumping movements into the stretch * Hold the stretch for 30 seconds * Done. Don't forget to breathe! ## The Stretches ### Upper Body ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=159)) * **[Shoulder Backbend](https://i.imgur.com/VlZ0FVr.png)** | The shoulder backbend focuses on shoulder overhead flexibility. This is important for many weightlifting exercises, but also for handstands and hand-balancing. It is also important for shoulder health, especially when older. Stand up with a straight bodyline, tense your butt muscles and move your arms overhead. Move your arms backwards without losing the straight bodyline. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=161)) * **[Spine Backbend](https://i.imgur.com/GqJdRKA.png)** | The spine backbend focuses on thoracic spine mobility. If you ever dreamt of doing bridges on the floor, this is your exercise. A good thoracic spinal mobility can be progressed into all kinds of [fancy exercises](https://media3.giphy.com/media/12lXUg3Zm8jhjW/200w.gif). Place your palms (or fingertips) on your shoulderblades and tense your butt. Now lean back without arching your lower back and move the arms. You can bend the knees a little. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=357)) * **[Rear Hand Clasp](https://i.imgur.com/2Tb7ric.png)** | Did you ever want to scratch your back but couldn't reach the spot because you lacked behind-the-back flexibility? This is your exercise. It's good for your shoulderblades and to counter long sitting periods. This stretch is very important for upper body posture aswell! Get into a straight bodyline. Take a towel, a band or a t-shirt and grab both ends with your arms. One arm is overhead and one is behind the back. The upper arm pulls the lower arm gently into the stretch. Pull upwards. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=494)) * **[Lying Cross](https://i.imgur.com/IghCB3M.png)** | The lying cross is a stretch that is aimed at people with poor posture. Start on all fours and move one arm below the other arm until your shoulder [touches the floor.](https://i.imgur.com/gSSlesx.png) To deepen the stretch, lay down on the floor and extend the non-stretched arm to the front. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=809)) * **[Wrist-Biceps Stretch](https://i.imgur.com/oLzxXRA.png)** | This stretch works on your wrist flexibility and stretches your forearms, your biceps and your deltoid muscles. Stand next to a wall and place your palms on it. Fingers pointing backwards. Now straighten your arm and twist your upper body to the opposite direction. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=962)) ### Lower Body ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1248)) * **[One-Leg Pike](https://i.imgur.com/AkQKIrG.png)** | This stretches your hamstrings. Most people that sit on a computer all day have tight hamstrings, because those muscles are very tensed in a chair-sitting position. When you stretch them regularily, you can take load off your lower back. Flexible hamstrings progress into [the pike stretch](http://bravocrossfit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seated-pike-.jpg). Place your foot on a chair and lean forward with a straight back. If you're advanced enough to touch your toes with a straight back (!), then you can progress to the [standing version of the stretch.](https://i.imgur.com/SWZAKMa.png) ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1248)) * **[Kneeling Lunge](https://i.imgur.com/uzdn3Ad.png)** | The kneeling lunge works on your hamstrings, your quads and your hip muscles like the iliopsoas. This is the most important stretch to gain flexibility for the [front splits](https://cdn.gmb.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/splits-front.jpg). Place one foot in front of you and extend it slowly with a straight back. Use your hands to balance yourself properly. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1521)) * **[Pancake](https://i.imgur.com/uOIvAJG.png)** | The pancake stretches your hamstrings and your leg adductors. With strong leg adductors, you will have it much easier in martial arts and all dance moves.

Feel free to insert your own specific stretch into the program! *** ###**How often should i do this program?** A good starting point would be two times a week. If you have the time, do it three times a week! If you lack time, split it up into upper and lower body and do both once a week. *** ###**Can i do this every day?** Absolutely! However, if you feel pain or discomfort, do it a bit less. Your muscles need rest too and stretching is taxing your nervous system quite hard. *** ###**I have medical condition [insert here], can i do the program?** There's no one-size-fits-all answer for this one. Ask on the subreddit and people will make sure to help you with your specific problem. *** ###**When should i do the program?** Any time when you are relatively stress free is perfect. When your mind is relaxed, stretching is easier. Don't do it before a workout, because it increases injury risk. After a workout is fine! *** ###**I don't like this stretch: [insert stretch], can i replace it with something else?** Absolutely! You won't benefit from stretches that you don't do, because you hate them. Switch them up as much as you like and need. *** Have anything to add or any questions?

This is that writeup. It's really long, so please skip over the stuff that looks uninteresting (or just read the xxfitness one). # Pics & stats [Before & after album here](https://imgur.com/a/yi9e07L) Female, 5'8"" / 1.72, 25 years old Weight: 198 lbs/90 kg (July 2017) - 143 lbs/65 kg (now) - 55 lbs/25 kg lost in a year.

I went on my first crash diet when I was 12 (actually together with my parents, figures), gained \~30 lbs as a teenager by being depressed and eating my feelings, developed a horrible eating disorder at 16 and underate and ran my way to a bodyweight of 127 lbs/58 kg. I moved away for uni in 2011 and when I let go of eating nothing as a coping mechanism for dealing with life, I gradually got Really Fat. I felt horrible about the weight gain, but not horrible enough to make lasting lifestyle changes and my many attempts to (crash) diet were always short lived. I got up to 202 lbs/92 kg within 2-3 years which is insane and also obese at my height. My MyFitnessPall history only goes back to the end of 2014, but since then alone, I made 8 unsuccessful attempts to lose weight. In 2015 I graduated and moved to a different country to work at a company where all food is unlimited, magical and free. My weight fluctuated between 194 lbs/88 kg and 202 lbs/92 kg and I still felt awful. I had many excuses for being fat - I didn't want to get an eating disorder again, it's impossible to count calories when you don't cook your own food, I was really busy with my career, nothing I'd tried had ever worked, etc. but in July of last year, and after a minor health scare, I realised that losing weight would never be as easy as it was right now, being fairly young and having access to a great gym and healthy food at work. # Strategy: exercise & diet **What was different this time**: I realised that this time around, I needed a much better plan than before - not just counting calories but also regular exercise that I could stick with. If all you're doing differently when losing weight is having different eating habits, but the rest of your life is exactly the same, it's really hard to stick with it. I 100% believe that powerlifting is what has kept me on track for the last year. **For exercise**, I decided to focus on powerlifting because it allowed me to: * build muscle mass and burn more calories in rest * be in the gym in a productive and mentally healthy way (focusing on becoming stronger, rather than just skinnier, and having a quantifiable way to measure progress) * get addicted to said progress (them noob gains!) * it punished me if I missed a session, which made it really rewarding to stick to. I decided to jump on Phrak's Greyskull LP. I didn't know how anything worked in the gym, but I watched a lot of YouTube videos to educate myself on form, and just did kettlebell and dumbbell stuff for the first 1-2 weeks until I worked up the courage to ask some random dude in the gym to show me how the squat rack worked. I started lifting 3 times/week and stuck with Greyskull for about 4 months, making decent gains (more on this below). **In terms of diet**, I started counting/estimating calories and aimed to eat around 1200 - 1300 calories with 100+ grams of protein per day. Breakfast was usually high protein yoghurt with some oats in it, lunch was a salad with chicken breast, lots of low cal vegetables and sometimes some complex carbs and dinner was typically around 500-550 calories, the majority from protein. Lots of chicken breast, lean mince and turkey products. I found it hard to count/estimate calories at work (which is where I had all meals save for dinner), so I always tracked my dinners and weekends religiously and ate very similar things at work every day. As long as the scale kept moving in the right direction, I knew I was eating well. I'd usually have one cheat meal a week. Honestly, after the first 6 or so weeks, it really got surprisingly easy to lose weight consistently. Lifting and particularly the mental aspects of weight loss were a lot harder. More on how little calories I was eating below. # Progress and programming ***Apologies for this being super long but I wanted to show my full experience of trying to become strong on a steep deficit.*** **First 6 months of weightloss and training:** on Greyskull I got up to a 3x5 115 lbs/52.5 kg squat after 3.5 months (late October) and my deadlift went up to 160 lbs /72.5 kg x 5. Around this time I started hitting walls especially on bench and I decided to deload my squat to improve my form. I switched to 5/3/1 for beginners and made some decent gains again, though it took me all the way to January to bring my squat back up. I decided to add in cardio (running) 2 times/week after getting a Fitbit and seeing that my heart rate rarely went into the peak zone or even cardio zone. I also added in a lot more vanity accessory work (mainly focused on shoulders, arms and back) because it was around this time when I figured out I actually wanted to look swole (or as [r/xxfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness) like to call it, ""hot and scary""). At the end of the first 6 months of my weight loss, I was lifting 3 times/week and doing cardio twice, and I was down to \~159 lbs/72 kg. **Hitting a wall due to eating too little**: around January - February, I was still eating around 1200-1300 calories, and I was grinding away quite hard - failing lifts often, pushing hard on the 5/3/1 FSL sets even if I couldn't complete them without some form breakdown, and this led to me hurting my rotator cuff, which is why part of why my bench still sucks. Rehabbed with help of a physio. After frustratingly grinding away some more and then meeting a powerlifting friend at work who talked some sense into me (thanks, senpai), I realized I needed to eat more to continue to make progress. I upped my calories to \~1500-1600 and funnily enough more weight fell off than before, likely because the extra calories allowed me to train harder. At the end of this period (end of April) I was still lifting 3 times/week and doing cardio twice, mostly running. **Would I recommend eating this little?** In hindsight, I definitely should have upped my calories and increased my cardio and training intensity earlier (as to continue to lose weight) or I should have been less demanding of myself and my lifting progress. Yes, as an obese person you have a lot of room to make gains on a steep deficit especially at the beginning of your weight loss, but you will run out of easy gains and shit will get very tough. If I'd do it all again, I'd still start out at 1200 - 1300 calories, but I would have upped them earlier. **Maintaining & training for my first (mock) meet**: At the end of April I decided to maintain weight around 145 lbs/66 kg for a while because we had a powerlifting competition at work in early June and I wanted to train extra hard to hit my strength goals. I added in a fourth lifting day a week (an extra deadlift day) and changed my cardio to lower impact (stairmaster) to improve recovery. During this time I went from squatting 1 plate/135 lbs/60kg for the first time to squatting 165 lbs/75 kg at the competition in just 5 weeks - shows what you can do when you eat at maintenance! I also hit a 2 plate/220 lbs/100 kg deadlift (up from 187 lbs/85 kg in February) at the competition which was a long term goal. I found it a crazy mental struggle to eat at maintenance during this time but I'll talk about this in the last section of my post. Great gains were made and I even made some recomp improvements seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/74AOxw2). I weigh roughly 145 lbs/66 kg in both pictures and they're 2 months apart. In total I was training 6 times a week, lifting four times and doing cardio twice. Side note: in hindsight I don't recommend my style of deadlifting heavy twice a week if you're not eating a ton (I was following 5/3/1 for deadlifts and progressing every session - so I'd do 2 weeks worth of progression in one week) - my lower back still isn't back to normal. Whelp. # Results & what's next All in all, even though I'm not strong yet and my lifting progress is somewhat mediocre, I hit 'intermediate' for all lifts within 1 year of lifting on Symmetric Strength save for my bench - which I'm okay with given my injury. I recently also completed a Tough Mudder (full distance, 11 miles) with zero problems and a year ago that would have seemed as unachievable as climbing the Everest. Fuck cardio, but I'm glad I'm fit enough to be able to pull of something like that. I also cannot emphasize enough how amazing it feels to be moderately happy enough with how I look. I'm not at the bodyfat % that I'd like to be at one day but strength is my focus for the next while. My main goal is getting a 2 plate squat and a bench that doesn't suck complete ass. In terms of short term physical goals, just let me look like I lift please! # Current diet & routine **Diet**: currently I estimate I eat around 1800-1900 calories (sometimes more if I have a cheat meal which is still only about once a week) and I'm maintaining for now, slowly trying to up my calories while not gaining weight. My protein intake is the main thing I watch, aiming to get around 140 grams/day. What I eat is still pretty much the same as when I was losing weight, just bigger portions - and in general, I try to eat more healthy carbs around my workouts. I still eat lots of chicken breast, lean steak, turkey burgers/sausages and beef mince, and I go through a ton of low fat/high protein greek yoghurt. **Exercise**: In terms of lifting - I did 5/3/1 BBB for two weeks after the meet and then decided to bail the fuck out of that because I just wanted to lift 5 times a week with very high bench frequency. So I jumped on nSuns (5 day version) and I'm enjoying it massively so far. Like I mentioned I'm still having some lower back issues so I've had to skip squats and deadlifts for the last 2.5 weeks, replacing them with rehab work. Still lifting 5 times/week though. I do a lot of pulling to balance all the nSuns pushing and put in a lot of vanity work to try and put on more muscle. Happy to write out what I do exactly in the comments if anyone wants the details. For other exercise, I'm still doing cardio twice a week - I actually enjoy the stairmaster in a twisted way and I also like HIIT on stationary bikes. I do one cardio session on one of my days off, and one on an upper body day (usually the OHP/incline bench day - lift in afternoon, cardio in evening), training a total of 7 times/week. # Lastly: the mental aspects of weight loss **By far the hardest part of this journey** has been the mental aspect and I hope some people will be able to relate. Things I struggled with included, but weren't limited to: finding it hard to not be completely obsessed by numbers on the scale and/or bar; finding it very hard to let go of eating little (this was the hardest of all, and still is), and deciding between becoming stronger now (by eating more) or giving up good strength progress to get the body I want (by continuing to cut). I've also struggled at times to accept that I want to be swole rather than skinny - sometimes I realize I'm getting less conventionally attractive to some people and occasionally this worries me but usually I'm good at ignoring that and doing whatever makes \*me\* happy. In the end, you just have to learn to let go of thoughts that objectively don't make sense for you and your goals - such as not wanting to eat more. **On attitude**: in the end, your thoughts control who you are and what your habits become. I distinctly recall thinking halfway through my weight loss journey: ""I hope I'm one of those people that actually end up looking really fit after their weight loss and stick with it"", and shortly after realized that it's insane to think of this as if it's determined by an external set of factors. Only you control how you end up and nothing else. All habits you can build and become used to. One year ago, if someone would have offered me the choice between $500 then, or $10,000 if I'd manage to lose 40 lbs within a year, I would have taken the $500 hands down - not for the money, but because I never ever believed that I could become a fit person with really healthy habits. Yet if you start with simple habits and focus on sticking to them consistently, it's crazy what you can build up to over time. I know people who make progress posts say this all the time, but it really is true… If I can do it, so can you. \--- **So there you have it!** Apologies for the absolute novel and happy to answer any questions because I have a lot more to say on this topic - just don't want this post to get any #@!!# longer :)","Unless I misread something, your OHP is very high relative to your bench (80%, where 60-66% is average for people who regularly train both). Assuming that's a strict press and not push or something, odds are fairly high you have the physical strength to bench more and your technique is missing something.   Anyway, just a thought. Great progress all around.",752
93gbfc,"Hi, it's me again.  Previously I've submitted analyses of [drug-free powerlifting meet results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8wdrox/how_age_strength_and_sex_impact_strength_gains/), the [periodization literature](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7p27br/a_comprehensive_overview_of_the_periodization/), and the [sex differences literature](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8b8t26/strength_and_muscle_gains_in_men_vs_women/). Once again I found myself with too much time and data on my hands, and this time I tackled training frequency. As a bit of background, training frequency has been a contentious subject for a while now.  When I first got into lifting in 2005-2006, there was a really strong orthodoxy in favor of pretty low training frequencies.  Bodybuilders trained each muscle once per week, powerlifters mostly trained each exercise once or twice per week, and that's just the way things were.  Starting in 2010 or 2011, more people started experimenting with higher frequencies as Sheiko programs and Smolov started getting popular, and in 2012, the Norwegian Frequency Project was published.  For those unaware, the Frequency Project caused a pretty big stir.  It found that, in a group of pretty well-trained powerlifters, training each lift six times per week led to significantly larger strength gains than training each lift three times per week.  For years, there were a lot of forum wars waged over that study, because there was very little high-quality frequency research (so a lot of people put a bunch of their eggs in the basket), but it was never actually published in a peer-reviewed journal (so a lot of people completely disregarded it). However, in just the last ~6 months, the frequency literature has entered a renaissance.  The number of volume-matched studies comparing the effects of different training frequencies on strength gains has doubled.  So, I gave them a thorough analysis.  Here are the basic findings: 1) Using standard meta-analytic procedures, [higher training frequencies are associated with larger strength gains](https://i2.wp.com/www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Frequency-forest-plot-1.png?w=640&ssl=1).  There were two positive outliers.  When removing them, the effect is still significant.  The effect is small (d=0.27 with the outliers included, and d=0.25 without them), but actually comparable to the effects of volume on strength gains, according to a [recent meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755103) by Ralston et al. 2) The effect was significant for both trained and untrained lifters. 3) There seems to be a [roughly linear relationship](https://i0.wp.com/www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Weekly-Strength-Gains-smart.png?w=990&ssl=1) between frequency and strength gains up to at least a 4x/week frequency.  There weren't many studies with really high frequencies, so it's hard to say whether the relationship holds past that point. 4) The most important finding was that the effect of frequency on strength gains was [large and consistent for pressing exercises](https://i2.wp.com/www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Frequency-upper-body-2.png?w=675&ssl=1).  However, frequency did not seem to significantly affect strength gains for compound lower body exercises (i.e. squats, leg press, etc.). Standard caveats apply.  Science deals with averages, so we can't know if these results will generalize to you, as an individual.  Maybe you do poorly with high-frequency pressing, but high-frequency squatting is great for you.  However, we do now have pretty robust evidence that higher training frequencies are beneficial for strength gains, particularly for pressing exercises.  Also note, this analysis deals solely with strength, not hypertrophy.  The most recent [hypertrophy meta](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172) found strong evidence that frequencies of at least twice per week were better than just once per week, but there weren't enough studies to say much about even higher frequencies. This is the very abbreviated version.  You can find the full analysis here:  **[Training Frequency for Strength Development: What the Data Say](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-frequency/)** Full disclosure:  this article is on my website, and I'm the author.  I'm about to get new internet installed, so I may not be around to answer questions until later tonight, but I will get to them.","Wow, you even recognized ""data"" as a plural.

940xdt,"There's an old guy at my gym who may be in his mid 50s. He in great shape. Somewhat muscular and really cut. He's a smaller guy, maybe 5'5 or 5'6 and maybe 150-160lbs. From the way he carries himself and how he looks, he looks like he knows what he's doing.  He often does these unusual powerlifting routines. He goes on the squat rack and loads up probably 400 lbs in the squat position. When I first saw this, I was like ""Wow, can that guy squat that much?"". Then he proceeds to simply unrack it, stand with it for a few seconds, and rerack it.  He did this with various high weighs. I see him do it often, but I've never seen him actually squat any weight. Today I saw him doing this in the bench press postion. Racked a lot of weight, unracked the weight, held it for a few seconds, and reracked it. I've never seen him do any compound movements with these weights. Just unloads it, stands with it or holds it as long as he can, and reracks.  The reason I'm asking here is because I would assume it's some kind of ego lifting, but the guy is older and looks to be in great shape, so maybe he knows something I don't. I've never seen him move during any of these high weight exercises, and I've seen him dozens of times at the gym. What is he doing?

95qy9p,"[The start of my make shift gym](https://imgur.com/a/NvnIXfk) A little background: My parents and I got in a bit of an argument yesterday about fitness and going to the gym. I’ve been at the gym consistently for about 3 months and have made [decent gains that I would like to keep](https://imgur.com/a/gK4wNdm).  Unlike me, my parents are not very health conscious at all, and even though they’re technically “obese” (on a BMI scale) they’ve ignored doctor’s warnings about their risk of developing  adverse heart conditions. They’re actively against taking action about their health even though they read health articles everyday and feel educated on the topics.  On top of this: all of my aunts on my dad’s side are obese and have eating disorders. My mom’s side seems to be a bit better but not by much. My uncles on both sides are quickly becoming obese.  My sisters are younger than I am (I’m 18) and are quickly gaining weight (and it’s showing) because of their irresponsible eating habits. They consume junk non-stop and eat until they’re full every time they sit down to eat.  Overall, the cards aren’t really stacked in my favor.  Last night, (its been one day since I arrived home), we were eating at the dinner table and I brought up the idea of going to the gym or at least signing up. The nearest gym is a ways away and cost $45/mo. I do have the money, but it’s to be spent on books for the upcoming school year.  Asking about signing up was a mistake. A cascade of bogus health advice and assessments of my body ensued (they think I’m anorexic).  I was fuming for a bit after, but in the middle of the night I started trying to make some weight with some of the left over sand that we had in the garage. ^TL;DR^ Parents don’t like that I want to go to the gym so they won’t let me go. I made my own gym.  My routine looks like this. Height: 5’7” Weight: 150lbs ^1st block - early morning^ - 3x15 bicep curls - 3x15 barbell Curls - 3x25 bench (with sand filled jugs) - 3x15 squats (I just started working out legs)  - Misc Freeletics workout - 50 push ups. (Repeat for second evening block - w/o Freeletics)  ^Cardio:^ - 1.4 mile run, I try to do this in less than 10:00 with a mile pace of less than 7:00.  - 200 fast paced jumping jacks ^Macros:^ 1650 calories (huge “flash cut” in preparation for bulk this winter) TDEE: 2155 (including cardio) about 2000 without it. Average over last 7 days 132g protein  179g carbs  55g fat Trying to up my protein to about 160g ish as I cut down to 1550 calories next week.  It’s a shit ton of work, but it’s sure as hell worth it.   EDIT: WOW, expected a positive response from this sub but not an overwhelming one! Thanks for the compliments and advice. But to answer some FAQs: 1. I’m 18. 2. I don’t own a bike. 3. Nearest Gym is 7 miles away (damn rural Texas) 4. I’m trying to live as an example for my parents.  5.

It was a confidence thing, I never really cared for how big I was, I was just happy I was a 6ft male.  Initial Macros goals at 130lbs  CARBS: 342 G PER DAY. PROTEIN: 228 G PER DAY. FATS: 85 G PER DAY. These were not reached everyday but I tried my best to get as close as possible using mass gainer. I ate anything I could get my hands on just to get in the habit of eating more. The second semester of college I started going to the gym with a friend who was much bigger than me. He helped push me to achieve the goals I wanted, which was put on some type of weight. My initial lifts were: **Initial Component lifts**    **Bench - 55-65lbs for reps**    **Squat - 85lbs**    **Deadlift - 115lbs** After my freshman year I saw progress and I started wanting to lift more and gained around 12-15lbs. This weight of 145-150lbs was constant till about last year and my component lifts went up to: **Component lifts progress after a year**    **Bench - 145lbs**    **Squat - 135lbs**    **Deadlift - 165lbs** My weight had gone up to around a constant weight of 155lbs which was a major jump, yet I still looked skinny since I was so tall. I then tore my ACL and went back down to 145/150 and lost all motivation last summer. However last November I decided to put my all into gaining muscle and getting bigger, along with rehab I went to the gym religiously and started giving it my all. I started taking mass gainer every morning and night after my workouts and made sure to eat around 3400 calories a day without the shake. Fast forward till today when I had the courage to post this photo to share my before and after of 4 years of lifting with constant breaks until this past year. My current PRs are: **Component Lifts today after 3.5yrs**    **Bench - 235lbs**    **Deadlifts - 385lbs**    **Squat - 215lbs (low due to ACL recovery)** This is a transformation from 130lbs to weighing in at 176lbs today. No supplements other than mass gainer. I hope I motivate all the skinny guys out there. And I aim to get to 185lbs by next summer. My initial lifts were the beginning push/pull/legs with sets of 4 going from 12-10-8-8 reps respectively. My workout for the past year has been split into  the 5 days below with a 5x5 of the component workout for the respective day and then accessory lifts of 3 sets of 8-12reps. Workout:  Monday     1.Bench - 5x5      2. Incline dumbbell press super set with dumbbell flies increasing weights for 4 sets for reps of 12-10-8-6 respectively.     3.

Deadlifts 5x5 same weight      2. 4 sets of wide grip body weight push ups till failure.     3. V bar cable rows 3 sets of 10-8-6 increasing weight.      4. Lat pull down 3 sets of 8-10      5. Single arm dumbbell row for 8 reps each arm Shoulders       1. Standing overhead press 4 sets of 12-10-8-6 increasing weight      2.

Traps with dumbbells 3 sets of 15-20 squeeze at top  Legs -     1. Squat 5 sets of 8-10      2. Leg press machine - 4 sets increase the weight get 6-10      3. Hamstring curls 3 sets 12-15     4. Leg extensions 3 sets 11-15     5. Calf press machine 3 sets of 15 Arms - every workout is a superset with biceps and triceps     1. Cable straight bar curl and triceps rope extension 4 sets of 12-10-8-8 increase weight      2. Preacher curl and overhead dumbbell extension 4 sets of 8-10     3. Incline dumbbell curl with flat skull crusher 10-8-8-6     4. Hammer curls standing with triceps kick backs 10-12 reps for 4 sets     5. Burnout dropset of biceps cable     Curls and triceps extension with flat bar on cables.  My diet over the past 3.5yrs has consisted of oatmeal with peanut butter for breakfast with a shake. And then salmon, steaks, shrimp with other foods for lunch and dinner. **My macros for the last year and a half:** CARBS: 370 G PER DAY. PROTEIN: 246 G PER DAY. FATS: 91 G PER DAY. I usually reach these with the cycle of the same basic foods and snacks:  salmon, tuna, steaks rice and vegetables for dinner. Cliff bars for snacks along with a lot of peanut butter sandwiches. Oatmeal for breakfast with scoops of peanut butter. And my serious mass shake 2x a day.  If I haven’t mentioned any important info lmk and I’ll answer it, sorry in advance!  Thank you!  **TL:DR 4 years ago I never lifted once in my life, after 3 years of on off working out and the grinding the past 12 months I’ve changed how I looked completely.**",Nice! Like to see hard gainers progress. It's not always a weight loss goal. Weight gain is hard to progress also.,497

9ag2bc,"After 2 years of lifting I pulled a [3x bodyweight deadlift]( https://streamable.com/tfois) of 540lbs (245kg) at 178lbs(80kg) and would like to share what I’ve learned to help you improve your deadlift. **1.Tweak Your Technique** ==================== The absolute easiest way to deadlift more is to make the movement less difficult. Putting yourself at a mechanical advantage is simply easier than getting stronger. If you can leverage your body weight to start the lift, you reduce the amount of weight you need to force up. It’s free real estate baby.  _Conventional tutorial by Cailer Woolam_: https://youtu.be/L5paDnk51sQ _Sumo tutorial by Bryce Krawczyk_: https://youtu.be/LGIS9vs65Sk  **2.Strengthen your back** ==================== Wrapping a thread in duct tape helps more than wrapping rope. It’s easier to improve weak links then to further strengthen your strong points. Most people don’t train their back enough, in my opinion it is the biggest factor in getting a big deadlift. Never seen a great deadlifter without a jacked back. [Oleksandr Kutcher’s Back]( http://www.t-nation.com/img/photos/06-174-training/image005.jpg), [Cailer Woolam’s Back]( https://i.redditmedia.com/dRGvQuKG9ZYI_7Im5GW6rKXdDCboPxwQVfUUzNshdWk.jpg?w=320&s=2b47d246fa577b55523679c19023dc2f) , [Bob People’s Back]( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_U__RVEGy-Vg/S8mws7yM2jI/AAAAAAAABpA/NYXda6QCpB4/s400/rigerts+back.jpg)  The three lifts that have helped the most are: * _Weighted pullups_ (high volume) * _Heavy rows_ (low volume) * _Heavy barbell shrugs_ (low volume) 3.Learn to love front squats ==================== Sumo pullers are going to find the biggest carryover from standard front squats due both movements being quad dominant, but both kinds of pullers have a lot to gain from the following two variations.  _Pin front squats_ will blow up your explosive strength. Lower the safety bars and put the barbell at the level it would be at the bottom of a front squat, get under the bar and relax. You’re trying to avoid using the stretch reflex so you'll want to relax your body before you really begin the lift. When I perform these I do them for heavy singles, with generous rest between sets. _Beltless paused front squats_ **Full Disclosure**: these are ridiculously difficult. Load up 70-80% and pause at the bottom of the squat for 20seconds. These train your trunk not to bow under load and reinforce proper ab engagement. 4.Get properly warmed up ==================== Each person needs to warm up in a way specific to them. If your hips are naturally externally rotated, then a pigeon pose isn’t really helpful in getting your body ready for something it’s not used to. Identify which movements are difficult for you individually and work on them during warm ups. 5.Avoid using straps ==================== _“You grab the bar and smile because you just know you’re gonna get it”_ -Ed Coan. Being able to hold the weight adds a lot of confidence to the pull and assures you aren’t leaving pounds on the table if you decide to compete outside of strongman. Avoiding straps doesn’t mean not using them! Your hands are bound to get tore up at some point, you’ll have high volume sets, and you’ll have cruddy bars that slip. There is nothing wrong with using straps, but avoiding their use is very beneficial. 6.Experiment with programming ==================== Much like everything else, effective programming is going to vary person to person. I found that reducing my deadlifting from 2x weekly to 1x actually produced better results. For the majority of people I advocate for submaximal training and with bias recommend you try it out as well.  _Here is a video by powerlifter Brendan Tietz on submaximal programming_: https://youtu.be/pz8aOIcj_v0  Another important factor of programming is the time between cycles, the deload. As the weights get heavier your body will accumulate fatigue faster, providing it time to reset will allow you to lift with a higher intensity over time.  _Here is a video by strongman Brian Alsruhe on deloading_: https://youtu.be/wzwP-e0C6Cs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Implementing any of these tips should help you improve your deadlift, I hope everyone gets some use out of them! ","Thanks for bringing some quality content onto the sub. The deadlift looked way to easy to be a ORM and you definitely have more in you.  > 6. Experiment with programming  Wanted to emphasize this. For me personally, I greatly preferred maxing out (either a 1 or a 2-rep max) vs submax volume. Wouldn’t recommend it to everybody, and working near your absolute max may increase injury risk especially if you’re the type of person to have significant form breakdown at heavy loads, but it helped explode my deadlift to a solid 6 plates @ 173. If you’re trying something and it doesn’t feel like it’s working out, definitely do NOT be afraid to try something new ",301

In addition, We actually **have** had short stints of weightlifting in the past; in 7th grade (12 years old) for two semesters for 45 minutes a day, the first semester of freshmen year for an hour twice a week (football conditioning, though we both quit before the season started), and the summer before our senior year for an hour twice a week (track conditioning; they added conditioning during our senior year). This was mentioned in our very first progress post, but wanted to reiterate it because a few people were upset on our last one for not doing so. Two years ago was when we got a gym membership for the purpose of lifting.  ---   **Training**: Like mentioned in our previous post, we hopped on N-Suns LP Program about 7 or so months after starting. Before that, we sorta just messed around in the gym. We had a “program”, but it wasn’t really good. It didn’t have a progression protocol, a deloading protocol, no periodization. It was something we just made up. We strongly recommend against this route. Go on a program. Any in the wiki will do. You can see how much our progress changed from our first post 7-months in and our second 1-year update post. The changes in our dieting and going on a program contributes significantly to this progress.   We took the liberty up uploading template programs. We did this because during our first progress post, very many people just could not see the program for whatever reason. It was uploaded to Imgur, and some commenters said they could, but the amount of DMs we got stating they could not was absolutely overwhelming. They are not EXACTLY what we did because we modified our programs as we needed, but they are a very solid backbone of what we did. You should include whatever accessories you want. Our accessories focused on movements in so that we can increase our strength and improve lagging body parts in our physiques.  Program 1: [Starks Twins’ LP template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z00ocHkvOQQddMD6Dp8_JNmIJFV-JCAeuXS9u6RN_e8/edit). This is the program we modified based on n-suns. We did not like doing T2 lifts at all so we took them out, then altered the structure as time went on.   Program 2: [Starks Twins’ Weekly Undulating Periodization template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B1hXdmAIX_7bHZ-LUUjPqvIWMGsJqZNKlX50CRGQNKw/edit#gid=2045453449). This is actually a further modification from our once-every-two-week progression program that we uploaded during our progress post last year and what we currently run. The idea is that we have a week of lower intensity and higher volume, a week of moderate intensity and moderate volume, and a week of higher volume and lower intensity. During the low-intensity weeks, you have a 1+ where you increase the weight depending on how many reps you get for it. This only applies for squat and deadlift. For bench, it’s actually more of a DUP-style program where you have a day of low volume/high intensity, moderate volume/intensity, and high volume/low intensity. You still increase the weight every 3 weeks.  We make our own programs because we enjoy it. We don’t really recommend it. Perhaps we could get more progress by jumping on something like Shieko, and maybe we will sometime in the future, but for the time being, we’ve made reasonable progress so we’re going to stick to this until we no longer are making reasonable progress.  ---  **Diet**: IIFYM. We actually lowered the threshold from our last post from 200 grams of protein minimum to 1g/lb of bodyweight. We do like to stick to 200 during our cuts because our deficits are pretty large (will explain why momentarily) and we like to minimize muscle loss as much as we can, but we don’t stress if we only get to 175 or so.   Looking back at our old progress post, we can’t believe we overlooked a VERY big detail regarding how we approach dieting. We do mini-cycles. We remember asking [on Reddit]( https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5vtvrq/anybody_who_has_done_minicutbulk_cycles_what/) if anyone had any experience with it and got pretty negative answers. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a shot. Very glad we did because it was incredibly successful and we would definitely recommend it to those who are curious about it. The shortest cycle we’d recommend would be 4 weeks of bulking followed with two weeks of cutting (though we’ve done 6 weeks/3 weeks, 8 weeks/4 weeks, 10 weeks/5 weeks, etc). The bulking would be at a surplus of 350-500 calories and the cutting would be at a deficit of 700-1500 calories. We did harsher deficits when cutting for a competition to make our weight classes. We actually did not notice significant muscle loss regardless of what our deficit was, and any decrease in strength returned within the first 3 weeks of the subsequent bulk.  For reference, we also have done a longer cycle of 6 months of bulking, followed by a two month cut. We made very good progress on that one as well. They are both very valid strategies to approaching bulk/cut cycles in our experience, and we would recommend to do whichever you prefer.  ---   **Benefits**  We decided to do a mini-section on how our lives has improved since starting a lifting regime. We would be lying if we were to say that increasing our physical attractiveness wasn’t a primary motivator when starting to work out. And while we like to think we succeeded in that regard, the benefits of working out extends far beyond an improvement in looks. Most noticeably, our confidence and self-esteem has skyrocketed in the last two years. We don’t really talk about this often, but growing up, we didn’t really have any friends at all. The situation somewhat improved in middle school, and even moreso in high school. But even still, we were always shy and tended to keep to our small group of friends. Nowadays, we’re much more confident and self-assured, especially in social situations. We don’t have to overanalyze the things we say, which in terms had a huge effect on both our demeanor and the way people perceive us. Moreover, we’re generally happier and much more disciplined, especially regarding things like time management. All in all, we can confidently say that lifting has significantly improved our lives for the better.  ---   **Competing:**   You can read about our first competition in our 1-Year Update post. Since then, Austin has competed in one more meet and Justin has competed in two. We both compete in the USAPL powerlifting federation. You can read about our second meet together [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/7ayqq7/meet_report_ivy_league_championships_5325_kg_660/). Justin’s third meet did not go very well due to an injury that will be elaborated on in a later section.   Highlights include a state-record deadlift from Justin. His PR deadlift is also only 25 pounds from the USAPL national collegiate record in the 74kg weight class, so his goal is to break it before graduating from college. In addition, Austin’s PR squat is only 45 pounds away from the USAPL collegiate squat record, so he hopes he’s able to break it by next April so that he can move up a weight class permanently.   Austin’s wilks is actually higher than Justin’s. Officially in-competition, it’s about .5 wilks point higher at 418.3 (vs Justin’s 417.8), but Austin’s projected for his next competition is ~450, vs Justin’s ~440, if everything goes to plan. We’re hoping to graduate with at least a 490. It’s optimistic and we will elaborate on why it’s so optimistic in the last section.  ---  **Set-backs**  We actually both had set-backs that has affected our progress. In January of this year, Austin had a lower back injury. Originally, it felt like extreme soreness, but it never went away. Eventually, Austin stopped squatting/deadlifting (and at this point decided to not compete in the third meet that Justin eventually competed in) and went to a physical therapist. They believe it was a bulging disc, and helped him with rehab exercises. This is also when we decided to implement stretching into our regime: particularly in the glutes and hips. We wanted to include this section to emphasize the importance of mobility work. In fact, Austin strongly believes his hip/glute stretches contributed significantly more to his recovery than most of the stretches his PT recommended. We did absolutely no mobility work before, and unfortunately Austin suffered the consequences for them.  Justin’s injury was unrelated; he pulled a glute muscle in March peaking for USAPL Collegiate Nationals. We don’t really think this injury was avoidable as he was doing fairly light sets, but he does feel it contributes to his lack of progress, particularly lack of squat progress, so he felt like it was worth noting.  ---   **Supplements**  We don’t take any currently, though we do recommend creatine and fish oil. We personally had to stop creatine because it gave us migraines, and we just haven’t gotten around to ordering another bottle of fish oil which is the reason we’re not currently taking it.  And because it’s been historically asked in the past, we do not take PEDs. Our biggest proof is the [drug tests](https://imgur.com/a/fnNugCP) involved in competing in the USAPL.   Out of curiosity, one of us got our [testosterone checked](https://i.imgur.com/K6lwIn7.png) rather recently if that is of any interest. We don’t really know how to read it, but our free testosterone was 0.1 below the stated threshold, so I guess one can conclude that we have pretty good genetics in terms of muscle building (again, we don’t really know how to read it, so if our conclusion was off-base, please feel free to correct us in the comments).  ---   **Takeaways**  Traditionally, we have ended our progress posts with some advice that we hope people can benefit from. We decided to continue that tradition, and list 5 pieces that people who read this post could benefit from.  1. Set unrealistic goals for yourself. Did you know that at the point Justin decided that he wanted to break the Georgia State record, he was sitting at a 460lb deadlift and the meet was a month and a half away? During the meet, he tied it at 501 pounds, and shattered it 4 months later at 540 pounds, weighing 10 less pounds than the 74kg threshold. If you were to ask anybody if a 40 pound jump, while needing to cut for the meet, was feasible, they would laugh at you. But we strongly believe that setting unrealistic goals significantly affected our progress. A year ago, we had reasonable physiques. Of course we could’ve just maintained, maybe bulk up a bit to be at a more sustainable bodyfat, and cruise. But instead, we opted to give ourselves large goals and strove to achieve them. We actually don’t achieve them all of the time, but the act of trying is what will give you progress  2. READ THE /r/fitness WIKI. This is the most comprehensive online free fitness guide that we have ever encountered. When people DM us asking questions (either on Reddit or on our social media pages), we mostly refer them to the Wiki because it is an extremely good resource. It is long because of how comprehensive it is. If you were to memorize every single thing in the wiki, you would know everything you need to know to achieve the results you desire. Read it, read it again the next week, annotate it, then re-read for good measure.  3. Programming. Unless you have a good amount of lifting experience, you should get on a program. Obviously we’re biased towards ours, but honestly, any program in the wiki (READ IT) will do. People ask us all of the time why they aren’t making progress, and those very people: A) are on some really bad, homemade program they made themselves and B) don’t pay attention to their diet. Don’t make this mistake. Get on a program.  4. Dieting. We’re not going to make the claim that you NEED to cut/bulk to make progress. But what we will say is that the people who don’t make progress more often than not are eating at maintenance or just don’t pay attention to their diet at all. We’ve found that mini-cycles are a great alternative to recomping and strongly recommend them if the idea of bulking/cutting for months on end seems torturous to you. But you need to gain weight to gain muscle mass, and lose weight to lose fat mass (or at least it makes the process 100x faster).  5. Consistency. Just go. Stop trying to wait for New Years. Stop trying to wait until you reach a certain weight. Stop trying to wait until you can do x amount of pushups. Seriously, you’re only delaying your own progress. Just go, find a schedule that works for you, and stick to it. You’re not going to make progress if you go all-out for 6 weeks before quitting because you burnt out. Make sustainable, life-long changes to your life. Your results will come, but you have to be patient and stay consistent. EDIT: blurred out some identifying info in our screenshot EDIT 2: We have a ton of people asking what stretches we do so here are each of them! We do them for ~30 seconds each leg (when applicable; when not, just go 45 seconds). We do it whenever we can fit it in the day [Stretch 1](https://youtu.be/Ygt_QyUzlWM) [Stretch 2](https://youtu.be/ldhpSg5UT-U) [Stretch 3](https://youtu.be/lujQlvAGgJU) [Stretch 4](https://youtu.be/NisND39jxgY) [Stretch 5](https://youtu.be/Izw1DMaSmSY)",You guys look amazing!

9edwes,"Progress Pics: https://imgur.com/a/6rkx5yC Background: I had been working out off and on for years and years, but was often held back by diet, lack of discipline, lack of intensity, lack of volume. My girlfriend during these years always wanted to eat out and drink, and would always encourage me to skip it and say she doesn't like guys with muscles or six packs. Basically, I wasn't half assing it, I was quarter assing it. And when that relationship ended, I decided to finally commit myself to having the body I always wanted. Age: 29 Height: 5'11 Timeline: ~Six months slow clean bulk (From 155lb to 177lbs) ~Four months cut (From 177lbs to 155lbs)  Routine: I started with PHAT, eventually moved to PPL, then back to PHAT when I began my cut. Complex freeweight movements. 18-21 sets on a bulk, 15-18 on a cut. Skip the machines. At some point during your lifting, you should have a moment that scares you. When you're like fuck this is heavy I don't know if I can do this. Where you have to actually round up some grit to hit the numbers. you cannot make a change with a pedestrian mentality. Everything needs to be measured. Weight, bodyfat percentage, food/calories, rest periods, sets, lifts, reps, all of it. Write it all down. You need to set standards so you have an accurate picture of what you're trying to outdo the next time you visit the gym. These numbers will also be highly valuable to you half a year from now when you want to compare your progress. Use a simple pair of calipers and practice getting a consistent reading. It's more about comparing yourself to last week or last month than so much a truly accurate estimation of bodyfat percentage.  Mentality: If you want to stop looking skinnyfat and start looking like a fit person, then you have to become one. You can't simply pretend to be one for an hour, a day, a month, and go back to your old habits. It is a permanent change. You have to literally become a new person, one with new habits and values. You have to channel some kind of fuck you primal mentality. When you go to lift the heavy weight you have to feel this fuck you stupid piece of shit light weight aint fucking nothing bitch ass weight inside you.(inside you, not outside you making weird noises). You cannot have a pedestrian mentality. The numbers must. go. up. you must beat last weeks high score. Again, and again, and again. But do NOT do this by lowering the range of motion, taking longer breaks, using momentum to lift instead of your muscles, cheating your form, etc. it must be in the same vein as your previous lifts.  Diet:  (bulk) TDEE + 500cal (cut) TDEE - 500cal + EC Stack TDEE Calculator: https://tdeecalculator.net/ Get your one gram per 1lb lean body mass protein, but other than that, ignore all the fad diet low carb high carb no X no Z BS. Obviously you need to skip the sugar/fast food/etc., but other than that do whatever helps you stick to your goals. The harder/more restricted you make your diet the more likely it is you won't stick to it. I found it helpful to find 4-5 tasty meals that I genuinely enjoy, measure them so I know exactly what I'm eating and that it aligns with my TDEE needs, and eat them daily. This way I can skip the math and measurements more or less because I've done it.  Make it easy for yourself. If every day is feeling like hell, you need to reevaluate. I did all this while happily eating bananas, whole wheat bread/tortillas, oats, Fresca (calorie free soda) and found dieting to be surprisingly easy. There was no need for a cheat day, ever. Hitting that TDEE - 500cal day consistency is more valuable than punishing yourself with nothing but chicken rice and broccoli every day, leading to a Saturday night binge.  What I eat while cutting: Meal 1: 5 eggs 2 slices of toast 1 glass Fresca Meal 2: 2 Toast, 2 tbsp peanut butter, 2 Banana Meal 3: Whey Protein w/ Water + Cup of Oats Meal 4 (pre workout) one banana (post workout) one banana one scoop whey Meal 5: Veggie Burrito (boiled spinach, corn, beans, Newman's black bean salsa omg so good) snack if needed: pickles. Pretty filling, almost no calories Lift Numbers- When I was around 165lbs I had my best numbers(don't have record of my starting numbers). I didn't really value one rep maxes but to try and give an idea: Deadlift: 420lb x 1 Squat: 295 x 9 Dumbbell Bench: 100's x 10 (barbell messes with my shoulders a lot)  tl;dr progress pics- https://imgur.com/a/6rkx5yC","I had a girlfriend who also told me that she didn’t like hot guys with 6 packs, etc. she also had extreme insecurity issues.

9ihn63,"Not sure if this has been posted already, but I just wanted to share this with you guys. I started lifting at the beginning of the summer. I didn't have anything else to do, so I focused on getting fitter through my diet and exercising almost everyday. I've always been active, but lifting is more demanding than anything I used to do before. The thing is that I used to be really lazy. I would always procrastinate and try to do as little as possible. But lately I've been noticing a shift in that attitude. Now I feel more proactive and look forward to tackling tasks and challenges. I feel more motivated to work on myself in other areas of my life as well. I've also noticed that if I go 3 or 4 days without hitting the gym, that motivation lightly wears off and I become lazy again. I guess this has something to do with hormone changes? Any opinions or similar experiences?",Lifting and exercise helps me battle depression.,2035
9o3uj5,"## [5'10/M/165LB] I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/97j1y6/my_progress_so_far_21m/) back in August; at that point I had cut down to 172 from a record high of 200 pounds. I looked and felt amazing, and got a lot of positive feedback (and more valuable advice). I was originally planning on lean bulking from 172, but took a user's advice and instead maintained for a few weeks, before going on a cut once more to lose even more fat and keep pushing the envelope. I had already achieved a personal record of leanness and aesthetics, so every pound lost beyond that felt even better as I was setting new records day by day, week by week. Once I got to 170lb, I decided to go from a -1000 calorie deficit into running a PSMF cycle for a few weeks. PSMF, for those that don't know, stands for ""Protein-sparing modified fast"", and is a crash diet meant to be run for short periods of time. You eat very low calories, most of it being protein, and do a full-body routine 2-3 times per week to maintain. More information on this is covered in The Rapid Fat-loss Handbook, by Dr. Lyle McDonald. I got to a PR low of 160lb (on the sixth) and then began a lean-bulk, after doing a carb refeed over the weekend. My weight is currently at 166lb, I am now planning on leanbulking for 11 more weeks and then seeing where I want to go from there. My goals are now to get strong, so I am running the classic NSuns five day routine, and also pack more muscle mass on certain parts that I feel are lagging behind, like pecs. To elaborate, here's a list of what my diet would've been like during the PSMF. **DIET** **During the PSMF, this is what I ate on a typical day.** Breakfast: A scoop of whey protein blended in with ice and freshly brewed coffee. Lunch: Chicken breast, of varying weight. Let's say 150-200g, based off of what I pulled out of the bag that day. Dinner: Eggs, and tilapia. The tilapia's weight varied, just as the chicken breast's weight would. Snacks: I liked to blend ice, egg whites, and protein powder in a bullet blender, for some protein ""italian ice"". Also, single servings or cottage cheese or greek yogurt. **When I was cutting at a -500 deficit, this was a typical day.** Breakfast: Four eggs, 1 tbsp of peanut butter, one 40g serving of oats, 4 oz of milk/4 oz of water added to oats, and a scoop of whey as well Lunch: 150g of skinless, boneless chicken breast. Another 40g of oatmeal, this time a more savory variety with tsp of salt added, along with a 28g serving of shredded cheese. I also added 4oz milk/4 oz water. Dinner: My dinner was just a shake, so another scoop of whey and 8 oz of milk. An hour or two after, before bed I would eat a serving of cottage cheese or greek yogurt. **Lean bulk diet** Breakfast: Four eggs, 56g of dry black beans (cooked, I meal prep the beans and boil 5 servings as a time, then divide the cooked product by 5). 28g shredded cheese added to the eggs, and a serving of cottage cheese that I use to top four slices of toast w/ jam. Lunch: I skipped lunch here, ate a 400 calorie cinnamon roll (lol). Dinner: 205g chicken breast, 85g of peas, 145g of broccoli.  Snack: 80g of oats, 1tbsp of peanut butter, 8 fl oz of milk, and one scoop of whey mixed together, along with a tbsp of maple syrup. That ends up being about 2,000 calories logged into MFP, plus the 400 calorie cinnamon roll. 2,400 calories, 160g of protein.  &#x200B; &#x200B; **Exercise** During the PSMF portion of my cut, I followed a two day full body split. Exercise, sets, reps Squat or leg press 2-3 6-8 RDL or leg curl 1-2 6-8 Bench press or 2-3 6-8 Incline DB press Rowing or chins 2-3 6-8 Lateral raise 1-2 8-10 Biceps 1-2 8-10 Triceps 1-2 8-10 Weighted crunch 1-2 6-8 Back extension 1-2 6-8 **Pictures** Finally, here are the pics. I'll include the albums from the previous thread for your convenience, reader. [Starting pics, in Sept 2017. Warning: FAT](http://imgur.com/a/ftcRUfq) [January.

It has truly impacted my life for the better.  A couple months ago I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis. It's a pretty rare genetic disease that causes my body to attack my joints, causing inflammation and eventually turning them into solid bone. My sacroiliac joints are already fused, and my spine may follow.  I still lift weights, I do it safely, and my doctors have not placed me on any activity restrictions. Yet, I am unilaterally blocked from mentioning my disease on this subreddit.  > Advice about or for working around any medical condition or concern, such as: sickness, disease, medication, injury, pain, recent medical procedure, disabilities I do not see how this specific part of Rule #5 benefits the community. Work-arounds are an *essential* part of fitness, and are difficult to discover without trial-and-error. I'm a nurse, big proponent of the fact that **no one should ever disregard medical advice for any reason**, but stifling discussion of *targeted program modification* does nothing but make it harder for people to exchange valuable information that can prevent injuries.  I have seen this explained by moderators as ""well, it's a liability problem."" How is it any more of a liability problem than regular posts? Are healthy people running PPL, then suing the internet when they get an overuse strain? I want to lift safely, I want to try new routines, I want to improve my fitness. Everyone does. Pretending I have no special circumstances does nothing but hinder me from receiving relevant information.  ------------------------------------------- **Edit** *Enjoying the discussion. Even though I disagree, big thank you to the mods for taking their time to offer explanations for their interpretation of the rule.* **To summarize my stance: people with managed, chronic diseases should not be lumped in with sports injuries and people seeking medical advice. I am not more at risk from bad lifting techniques than anyone else.** **Edit 2** [Since this is somehow relevant](https://i.imgur.com/WHWhffM.jpg)","Not a mod here but my 2cents. >I still lift weights, I do it safely, and my doctors have not placed me on any activity restrictions.

Again, there is a difference between that and seeking medical advice. There is a difference between ""What squat variation can I do that puts less pressure on my spine?"" vs ""What squat variation is okay to do if I have fused vertebrae?""

9vlufy,"I'll put my list of questions as a TL;DR at the bottom if you're not interested in readying my story ___ I'm 6'2 and I've gone from 306 lbs to 249 lbs through a keto diet so far, which went super fast in the beginning but has been stagnating a bit lately.  I've decided I want to start lifting now, since my ideal body image is to be buff/""aesthetic"", rather than being slim/skinny. There are some amazing Obese to Athletic transformation posts in here, but I'm still a bit confused about the progress. Am I supposed to lose all my fatty weight before putting on more weight through muscles, or will the fat just disappear overtime at which point the muscles will show? I've picked up GZCLP, which might not be correct as I learned that I'm way more of a beginner than I thought yesterday, but I'd be happy to continue it.  Yesterday is the only data I have, but I'm really excited to discover / talk about things at the moment so it'll have to do for now.  ___ Yesterday's numbers: I ate:  * 1600 calories, which leads me to believe I might be at too big of a deficit, as my TDEE seems to be around 3200-3300. * 120g carb * 58g fat * 133g protein I lifted:  * Squat: 3*5 82lbs (I probably should've gone higher since my AMRAP lastest quite long, but I realised I had poor form so I didn't want to go higher at first) * OHP: 3*10 44lbs (Thought I'd just do the bar at first to get a grip for proper form, but this turned out to be a lot heavier than I thought, and I ended up only doing 6 reps in the last set with just the bar) * Lat pulldown: 3*15 72 lbs I changed my workout a bit from the original routine based on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/78996q/gzclp_guide_original_post_by_ulegdayskipper/) ___ Questions: 1. Currently eating at a 1600 (50%) deficit, do I need to eat more so my body doesn't start consuming my muscles? Or will my body continue burning fat as long as I keep lifting? 1. Do I need to be strict on my macros while I'm still losing weight?  1. With my goal to become buff rather than slim, when should I change my diet to a normal TDEE / a surplus? 1. I wasn't able to finish my third OHP set with just the bar, should I do another exercise to get up to par or just see how it goes next time? ___ If you feel like my diet questions completely missed the point feel free to point me towards more general advice, most of my experience comes from 1-2 days of researching. Thanks for reading!","First, congrats my guy you're doing good things To answer questions: A 50% deficit is pretty tremendous, I'd recommend eating a bit more for sure and being in a bit more moderate of a deficit. You can always decrease in the future.  Also, If you have a relatively high protein intake and are following a good progression program in the gym you should be able to build muscle in a deficit, especially if you're new to lifting.  If you couldn't finish th third set with the bar, there's nothing wrong with using dumbbells for a month or so. Up to you though, whatever you're comfortable with. I don't think it's that big a deal that you failed during your third set. Just keep working up!",498

a4r12k,"EDIT: ""Intermittent Fasting"" in the title of this thread should be replaced with ""Intermittent Caloric Restriction"" (creds to: u/Jiend). I wrote a review on some recent fitness/nutrition papers. I tried my best to write for the layman but also not oversimplifying anything. I originally wrote all of this on an external page which will not be linked here but for those who wish to see it, kindly DM me. Regardless, I hope you all learn something and enjoy reading this. This is all written for educational purposes so any discussion or comments within this thread are very encouraged! Also, if everything is far too wordy for you, I have included TL;DRs for each section. The covered topics: The anabolic window, intermittent caloric restriction, protein supplementation, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and squat technique (chronological order). The first paper that we will cover is a short one by Schoenfeld & Aragon (2018) in which they reviewed the literature on the “anabolic window” for protein intake after training. Short-term studies had conflicting results but a meta-analysis conducted by Schoenfeld, Aragon & Krieger (2013) actually showed a minor benefit to consuming protein immediately after a training bout in terms of muscle hypertrophy. However, after more analysis where they controlled for more variables, they found that this small benefit was more attributed to overall protein intake. This is because some studies did not match for daily protein intake between groups meaning that some groups were having a higher daily protein intake than some other groups (which is generally considered to be more important than intake timing). This meta-analysis has what we call a “heterogeneity” in the literature used. This simply means that the papers pooled and analyzed together widely differed in methods, populations and outcomes. So amongst those papers, we could see different protein intakes, training and untrained individuals and some being matched and not matched for daily protein intake. The review highlighted a trial done by Schoenfeld, Aragon, Wilborn, Urbina, Hayward & Krieger (2017) where 21 trained participants exercised 3 times a week for 10 weeks while either being allocated to a group that consumed 25 grams of whey protein immediately before or after a training session. Hypertrophy was similar between groups but the dietary control in the study was questionable as subjects actually ate at a reported calorie intake that was lower than baseline when they were supposed to be bulking. It is still up in the air as to whether there is any real benefit but all in all, the authors suggest that if there is any effect, it is likely very small. They also propose that a meal 3–4 hours before a workout is likely good enough as the anabolic response to a meal lasts up to 6 hours (Layman, 2004). 0.4/0.5 g/kg of protein intake pre or post exercise is also advised to be sufficient. **TL;DR:** There may be some advantage to eating protein immediately after a workout but it may be very small. More rigorous research needs to be conducted. Meals 3–4 hours before training and 0.4/0.5 g/kg of protein pre/post workout may yield adequate results. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — A randomized control trial studying the effects of intermittent caloric restriction (compared to a standard, continuous caloric restriction) on body composition and other bio markers in 136 men and women was recently published. Schübel et al. (2018) split all subjects into 3 groups. The first group did continuous caloric restriction where the daily caloric deficit was around 20%. The second group followed a 5:2 pattern for intermittent caloric restriction in which 2 non-consecutive days of the week consisted of a caloric deficit of 75%. The final group was a control group; a group with no advice to lose body mass. The first 12 weeks of the study (intervention phase) had the subjects work closely with dietitians to help follow their allocated diet plans. This included face-to-face sessions as well bi-weekly phone calls. The following 12 weeks (maintenance phase) had no advice from any dietitians but the participants did receive motivational support. In the final 26 weeks (follow-up phase), the subjects received no help whatsoever. Scales and diaries were provided to everyone to help track and follow their diets. The primary outcome chosen by the researchers was the expression (taking genetic information and turning it into a product) of 82 genes that are related to the pathophysiology of obesity. Other studied variables include body mass index, blood pressure, waist circumference, body fat, liver fat, diet compliance and quality of life. During the intervention phase, the intermittent caloric restriction group actually lost more body mass (-7.1%) compared to the continuous restriction group (-5.2%) but the p-value was just above significance (p=0.053). This just means that if were to repeat the experiment (assuming there is no difference between interventions and that results are obtained purely by chance), the chance of seeing a more extreme result is above a level that is considered safe. Anyways, after the 50 weeks, the percentage losses were a lot closer, -5.2% vs 4.9% for intermittent caloric restriction and continuous restriction respectively with no statistical significance. For the primary outcomes (gene expression), there was no difference. Between sub-groups like male vs female or overweight vs obese, there were no differences. There were no differences in biomarkers or quality of life. An interesting finding was that the intermittent caloric restriction group had the worst compliance in the later weeks. From 49 participants, only 9 were doing 2 energy-restricted days per week at the final week. This may be reflected in the fact that the intermittent caloric restriction group had a higher mass re-gain after week 24 compared to the continuous restriction group. Despite this, there were never any significant differences in any body composition variables at any time point in the study.  **TL;DR:** Intermittent caloric restriction is a valid method for weight loss but there does not seem to be a metabolic advantage from 5:2 intermittent caloric restriction over continuous restriction in overweight individuals. It may be harder to follow the intermittent caloric restriction diet for an extended period of time. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — The next study was carried out amongst new recruits in the US army while doing their Initial Entry Training (IET). IET is basically where civilians learn the fundamentals of being a soldier and improve their fitness before moving on to become trained soldiers. The programme is known to be quite tough and part of this is due to the documented caloric deficit (~600kcals) that most of the recruits suffer from during training (McAdam, McGinnis, Ory, Young, Frugé, Roberts & Sefton, 2018). McAdam et al. (2018) sought to see if there was an effect from whey protein supplementation on body composition measures (body mass and skin folds) as well as fitness test results amongst 69 male recruits. The investigation was done in a double-blinded fashion (both the subjects and the researchers did not know who was getting which intervention) and the intervention lasted 8 weeks. Two servings (293 kcal, 40g protein) of whey protein were given per day (morning and night). Another group received a carbohydrate placebo that was matched for calories. Dietary analysis was done through logs completed by subjects in week 1 and 9 on 3 non-consecutive days. Both groups maintained about the same body mass and gained similar amounts of lean mass, however, there was a statistically significant, greater fat loss in the whey protein supplemented group with a large effect size (-4.6kg vs -2.7kg). An effect size is basically a numerical measure on how strong one variable affects another. It is generally categorized into small, medium or large effect sizes. In terms of fitness, the amount of sit-ups done in 2 minutes as well as the 2 mile run timing did not differ between groups despite seeing improvements in both groups. For push-ups, the whey protein group performed 7 more on average in 2 minutes (medium effect size).  Despite having regimented meals and meal times, dietary control was an issue with this study. There was a documented ~150 daily kcal intake difference between groups favoring the whey protein group. Therefore, the results may be due to the higher kcal intake rather than the higher protein intake or it may be more of a combination. There was also a great difference between all the subjects in terms of training history as evidenced by the extreme variation in lean mass between recruits at baseline. Training history has an effect on bodily response to protein as well as fitness. Lastly, this study lacks a control group. Regardless of these problems, it is clear that the additional calories ingested by the recruits had a positive effect on their fitness. Perhaps such a dietary approach can be adopted by the U.S. army in the future. **TL;DR:** The whey protein supplemented group had more body fat loss and higher push-up counts compared to carbohydrate supplemented group consisting of young males. This study, however, contains a few shortcomings in design (no kcal/training history matching). — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — A review on omega-3 fatty acid (n-3PUFA) supplementation for sports performance was recently published (Philpott, Witward & Galloway, 2018). From the work of Smith et al. (2011), we see that n-3PUFA supplementation has the potential to increase muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates in response to protein intake. Muscle protein synthesis is the addition of muscle proteins to muscle, the building blocks of muscle. The main acids of discussion are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA). EPA and DHA is mostly derived from fish oils while ALA is more from plant-based oils like soybean oil. An in-vitro (experiments done in controlled environments like laboratories instead of in living organisms like humans) study by Kamolrat & Gray (2013) found that DHA has no effect on MPS while EPA does. However, these effects on MPS may be redundant because optimal protein intake likely saturates any amelioration in MPS. Unfortunately, no studies looking at the effects of n-3PUFA supplementation of muscle strength/hypertrophy in the young and athletic exist. Although, there is some evidence suggesting muscle strength/hypertrophy and performance benefits in older men and women(Smith, et al., 2015; Rodacki, et al., 2012). There is theory for n-3PUFAs to help with synthesizing mitochondria. The mitochondria are parts of a cell that have the role of producing energy for our body. However, only one study examined this relationship and while there was a positive correlation, it was conducted in obese subjects (Laiglesia et al., 2016). Therefore, the use of n-3PUFAs for improving endurance is largely still theoretical especially in the athletic population. There is also some theory in n-3PUFAs having a positive effect on insulin sensitivity but it is mostly not understood. In a rodent study, increased expression of GLUT4 (protein which transports glucose to muscle, lowering blood glucose) was seen with n-3PUFA supplementation but any of this has yet to be seen in human experiments (Lanza, et al., 2013). Kawabata, Neya, Hamazaki, Watanabe, Kobayashi & Tsuji (2014) found reduced oxygen consumption with n-3PUFA supplementation in untrained, young males. This may be linked to insulin sensitivity theory as increased insulin sensitivity leads to more glycogen in muscles which would displace fat use for energy and less oxygen consumption as a result. This effect may not have such a considerable effect in sporting performance as Hingley, Macartney, Brown, McLennan, & Peoples (2017) found no improvement in time trial times, strength or average power with n-3PUFA use despite an observed reduction in oxygen consumption. n-3PUFAs have anti-inflammatory properties so it has been proposed that they can support the recovery process after sport/exercise. However, the literature shows equivocal results. Finally, there is interesting discussion as to whether or not n-3PUFAs can aid in the recovery from a concussion as substantial amounts of DHA can be found in the brain. Wang et al. (2013) showed that rats had better cognitive performance with n-3PUFAs compared with rats that had soybean oil. The closest human evidence to all this theory was obtained by Oliver et al. (2016) in which less concentrations of a biomarker for head trauma was seen in American football players who ingested n-3PUFAs. **TL;DR:** Omega 3 fatty acids have potential to improve muscle strength/hypertrophy, endurance, recovery and concussion recovery but much more evidence is needed before any recommendations can be made. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Dutra, Alex, Mota, Sales, Brown & Bottaro (2018) ran a randomized control study to evaluate the relationship between antioxidants and muscle strength, hypertrophy and fatigue. 42 young women participated in the study and they were separated into 3 groups. The first group ingested 1000mg of vitamin C and 400IU of vitamin E daily. The second group received a placebo and the last group was the control. Everyone followed a periodized training programme consisting of 2 upper body and 2 lower body exercises 2 times per week for 10 weeks. There were no reported differences in lower body muscle thickness, fatigue or strength. Furthermore, only the placebo group showed an improvement over control in peak torque and total work done. This indicates that antioxidant supplementation has a negative effect on muscular performance. It is unknown as to why the researchers did not assess the same variables in the upper body. The use of a dynamometer as a measure of strength limits applicability to training as more specific measurements like 1RM bench press or squat would give more realistic results. Finally, there was little to no dietary control within this study. **TL;DR:** Antioxidant use was detrimental to muscular performance amongst young women. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Comfort, McMahon & Suchomel (2018) undertook a review in search of the optimum squat technique. They defined optimum technique as having the least injury risk, most muscle activation and most carry-over to athletic performance. In regards to safety, they noted that squats are generally safer for the knee ligaments when compared to other leg exercises like leg extensions, however, the strain on the posterior collateral ligament increases with squat depth (Zheng, Fleisig, Escamilla & Barrentine, 1998). Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) strain can also be minimized by keeping the heels on the ground likely due to less tibial displacement (your shinbone moving around) with the heels on the ground (Toutoungi, Lu, Leardini, Catani & O’Connor, 2000). Some people suggest to keep the knees behind the toes in the squat especially if you want to preserve knee joint health. While this does decrease the knee joint forces by 22%, it increases the hip joint forces by over 1000% and it may have negative effects on the lumbar spine due to a more forward trunk lean (Fry, A. C., Smith, J. C. & Schilling, B. K., 2003). One final point to make on injury risks is that using lighter loads for greater depth will not necessarily decrease the joint stress at the knee because the knee still has to withstand more force from the higher knee flexion angles as a result of increased squat depth. As for squat depth, deep squats are better than 1/2 and 1/4 squats for strength and performances like jumping (Weiss, Andrew, Wood, Relyea & Melton, 2000; Hartmann, Wirth, Klusemann, Dalic, Matuschek & Schmidtbleicher, 2012). Part of these results were in conflict with a study done by Rhea et al. (2016) where sprints and jump performances were improved best in the 1/4 squat depth group when compared to those who did 1/2 depth or full depth squats. Bazyler, Sato, Wassinger, Lamont & Stone (2014) discovered that the addition of partial range of motion squats to full-depth squats over 7 weeks led to greater 1 rep-maximums against those who did only full-depth squats in trained men. However, this may simply just have to do with the increased volume as well as increased training intensity for those who did partial squats. Digressing to muscle activation, smith machine squats have been shown to decrease activation in a couple of the quadriceps muscles (Schwanbeck, Chilibeck & Binsted, 2009). Before continuing, it is important to discuss the relation of electromyography (EMG, recording electrical activity from muscles) to muscle strength/hypertrophy. Correlation with strength has been documented by Hof (1997). The correlation with hypertrophy is not perfect but it is strongly correlated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for measuring muscle activation and fMRI can adequately forecast muscle hypertrophy (Dickx, D’hooge, Cagnie, Deschepper, Verstraete & Danneels, 2010; Wakahara, Fukutani, Kawakami & Yanai, 2013). In an EMG study run by Caterisano et al. (2002), the full squat was found to have had better activation in the glutes compared to parallel or partial squats. A more recent EMG experiment from Bryanton, Kennedy, Carey & Chiu (2012) discovered greater EMG responses in the knee extensors (quadriceps) with deeper squats but not in response to heavier loads. The glutes, however, responded more to heavier loads and deeper squats as well. This suggests the quadriceps can be “isolated” in a sense with low load, deep squats. Foot rotation has only been reported to have an effect on hip abductor activation (the smaller glute muscles that sit under the gluteus maximus) with external rotation (feet turned out) and this rotation may allow for greater depths to be achieved (Pereira, Leporace, Chagas, Furtado, Praxedes & Batista, 2010). Lastly, an increased stance width (beyond shoulder width) results in more glute and adductor longus (thigh muscle under the quads, moves leg towards body along the lateral plane) activation. In the end, the authors recommend a squat with a “natural” stance width / foot rotation, heels on the floor, full depth (115–125 degrees of knee flexion), neutral spine and free movement of the knees (allowed to go over toes). **TL;DR:** Squats are fine for knee ligaments. Heels on floor = less ACL strain. Knees behind toes cause more hip joint stress. Deep squats generally better. Smith machine may have less activation of relevant muscles, greater depth has better activation, feet rotation does not have much of an effect and wider stance width can activate glutes more. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Bazyler, C.

a7mdan,"I've been reflecting on some of my stalls in weight loss and feel like I can contribute it to my office job, where I generally sit for 8-10 hours daily. I get up and walk around a little every hour, but at the end of the day my steps are never close to 10k. I telecommute, so I feel like it's even more difficult for me. I get an hour for lunch and generally use it to watch videos and relax while eating, but I am going to start incorporating a 30 minute walk. What are some things you do to ""catch up"" to other folks who walk often and are on their feet all day? Do you just work a little harder in the gym?

abwgs5,"Hi all, I am mod of /r/swimming and an experienced marathon swimmer (over thirty open water swims greater than 10k).  I usually post some advice here each New Year to assist new and improvng swimmers, and people hoping to use swimming for exercise and weight management. Swimming is a sport that when done consistently will allow you to pursue it for an entire lifetime and reward you for doing do. /r/swimming is a great resource, especially if you use the search bar, as there is almost no question that hasn't been asked and gotten an answer previously. [Here's last year advice](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7n8xff/folks_each_new_year_i_like_to_give_some_advice_to/ here). I've said previously that there are no tricks or secrets in learning to swim. But it’s not entirely accurate about other aspects of swimming.  These are secrets in that experienced swimmers know them, but it can take a long time for others to learn. These are the nuggets of knowledge that get passed in changing rooms and on decks, and are part of what we might call swim culture. This should help collect some of the “soft” knowledge that experienced swimmers gain over time and so many new and improving swimmers haven’t yet learned, especially if they are not part of a swim group. **Lane Etiquette** By far the most annoying thing for swimmers are people joining the lane who have no understanding of lane etiquette used around the world by experienced swimmers. Actually this often includes the lifeguards on duty many of whom (most in my experience)  don’t understand either.  Below are four simple rules. Yes, I know as a beginner you think this is too much, but people don’t play golf with a hockey stick, so I don’t know why non-swimmers think swimming is different. [Here is a comprehensive explanation of lane swimming etiquette  if you are inclined](https://loneswimmer.com/2011/02/15/lane-swimming-etiquette/). * Ask or let the swimmer already in the lane know you are joining. * Don’t start swimming or turn in front of a faster swimmer. * The fastest swimmer has the right of way. * Stay aware of what everyone is doing to avoid collisions and frustration for all. **Goggles** Because every swimmer in the world has an opinion and will happily entertain long discussions about goggs. * No anti-fog will last on goggles longer than a couple of months * Spit into googles for a simple reasonably effective anti-fog. Never touch the inside of the goggles. * Use a 2/3 water, 1/3 baby shampoo mix, swirl it around and rinse it out for a more effective anti-fog * Most “high visibility open water goggles” aren’t high visibility and are seriously over-priced. The google design offering the most visibility are clear Swedish goggles (aka Swedes). Which are also the cheapest. * More expensive goggles does not in any way mean better. Blame triathletes for the escalation of costs. The best goggles I’ve bought in years were €4 in Lidl the summer before last. * There is no such thing as a generic “best google” answer. Competitive swimmers/online swimmers most often respond Vanquishers  or Swedish Goggles. Vanquishers are not available in Europe anymore & Swedes (Which I wear myself in the pool and [I show you how to fit here](https://loneswimmer.com/2013/06/26/how-to-swedish-goggles-fit-and-review/)) aren’t a good idea for beginner swimmers. I also wrote [this article about understanding the different kinds of goggles](https://loneswimmer.com/2015/02/04/how-to-understand-and-choose-between-the-different-types-of-swimming-googles/) so you can choose based on your own requirements rather than other’s opinions, because I had never once seen anything like this by any of the goggle manufacturers, or anyone else. * Silicon straps don’t last long. Bungee straps are a great replacement. * Two thirds of my swimming time is spent with my face underwater exhaling. I can see everything including guys jerking off, teenagers and older couples fiddling with each other and numerous erections. **Technique (Front crawl)** The name of the stroke is front crawl. Freestyle means that in competition you can swim any stroke, and since crawl is the fastest, it (mostly) gets used, so a lot of swimmers think crawl is freestyle and visa versa. Someone will probably even say in the comments here that no-one calls it front crawl. Front crawl is extensively used outside the US and is the accurate term. BLABT  is the acronym for the process most swim experienced teachers use to evaluate stroke and teach front crawl. It stands for: * **B**ody position * Get horizontal in the water. Not being horizontal is the most common reason for swimming slow. * Push your chest forward and down into the water. Try to swim downhill! * Keep your head low and steady, don’t allow it to swing to the side. Imagine you are an a rotisserie spit that enters through your forehead, your whole body rotates around the centre point. If you raise your head, it’ll cause the rest of your body to sink. * Clench your butt cheeks. (Core muscles are used for position and rotation, doing this helps engage them). * **L**egs * In an elite swimmer, the maximum propulsion that comes from kicking is only 15% of overall speed. But to do that requires the body’s largest muscles and disproportionate amount of energy. (Long distance swimmers like myself do very little or no kicking). * Fixing the kick is important for beginners so the legs don’t slow you down or cause you to sink. Kicking wildly (especially common in runners or triathletes) is more likely to cause you to slow. This is also part of the horizontal body position above. From what I have seen most triathlete swim coaches get this completely wrong and spend far too much time focusing on a better kick. * You are not riding a bicycle. Kick from the hips, with only a little movement in the knees. New swimmers often have a big wide kick or their legs sinks, or both. This slows them down. * While reading this, see if you can point your toes like a ballet dancer. If you can’t, start stretching your ankle while watching TV or while sitting at a desk. Not being able to point your toes while swimming is like pulling a weight behind you. * Try swimming with your toes clenched into a fist. [Yes, just like Die Hard](http://die%20hard%20make%20toes%20into%20fists/). This will stop you kicking from the knees. You won’t be able to do it all the time, but it will help you understand what your position and kick should feel like. * **A**rms * Reach forward. Further still. * Pull back underwater. But only when your palm is facing backwards behind you, not when they are facing the bottom. This called the Catch, when your hand starts effectively pulling. * Keep pulling, then pushing backwards until your thumb scrapes your thigh. * Try to always keep your elbow above your hand, at every point in the stroke. * This is not easy, and take a long time to get right. * **B**reathing * Exhale underwater * Hum a little to get used to controlling your breath and exhalation * Try sinking to the bottom of the pool with no arm or leg movement. This will help you learn breath control. Only do this when there is a lifeguard present. * Rotate your head out of the water, don’t lift it. Don’t look forward or around. There is no forward visibility as part of standard front crawl, and learning this is a separate activity. * **T**iming * Both arms and legs alternate and all actions are smooth and continuous. * Breathing is to the side. * Rotate your hips to drive your arms to reach forward. **Swimwear** * Buy your swim suits one size smaller than the size you think you should wear based on your street clothes because water causes fabric to expand. You can’t see it but others can. * Wear your swimsuit in the shower after your pool swim, it’s easiest way to wash out the chlorinated water. Suits will last up to four times longer. * Polyester suits lasts longer than chlorine tolerant fabric, and feels largely the same. * Swimsuits are currently in a “shrinking phase”, that is, getting smaller. Male briefs are becoming more thong like with very narrow side panels, female racing suits are getting cut much higher at the rear. You can find different cuts, but it can sometimes take a bit of work. * Never wring the water out of your swimsuit, it will weaken the fibres and seriously reduce its longevity. Simply squeeze it or use a suit spinner if there is one available. * Baggy board shorts should not be used. Beginner and many intermediate swimmers have problems with drag. Board shorts add even more drag and make improving your stroke even more difficult. * If you insist on using baggy shorts, please wear something tight underneath, because I have seen too many scrotums and assholes and I’m not even a paid professional. * How you look or feel in a swimsuit does not correlate with how well you swim. * There are three materials for swim caps: cloth, latex and silicone. Cloth is comfortable but otherwise useless, usually used by hotels to keep patrons from getting hair in filters. Latex lasts moderately well but snags hairs more. Silicone which is most expensive lasts longest but is also thickest and may be too warm for some people. No swim cap lasts for ever though. I never get more than a year from a cap. * Swim caps will last longer if your dry them between uses, and better yet sprinkle with talcum powder. * If you have a problem with the swim cap coming off your head while swimming, look for ones which have parallel ridges running around the inside edge. **Pool Hygiene** * Pool swimming took a leap forward in the 1960s once reliable swim googles became widely available and training sessions for Olympic swimmers were able to last for 3000 metres or even a whole hour!  * Goggles are essential for pool swimming because most pools use chemicals to make the water safe. [I have a longer post explaining the interactions of pool chemicals and people in more detail here](https://loneswimmer.com/2013/06/14/how-to-why-you-should-always-shower-before-you-use-the-pool-and-why-you-shouldnt-pee-in-it/). * Pools that have a strong chlorine or chemical smell are LESS clean than pools that have little or no odour.  The less the chemical smell, the cleaner the pool water. * Pool-water colour has little relationship to pool water quality. Most pools use pool tiles to make the water look blue. Some even add small amounts of copper into the water for the same reason.  * Just because you’ve read that swimmers pee in the pool doesn’t mean you have to. But if you do want to stay being a swimmer, you should probably reconcile yourself to the fact that you are absolutely swimming in dilute urine. If this is really troubling you, best of luck with your sex life. * It may not be chlorine that’s making your eyes burn. The pool may have the wrong water acidity (high or low). Soda-ash is added to pool water to control this. * Of course, if there are too many organics (sweat, urine etc) in the pool, then more chlorine must also be added to balance the pool. **Food & drink & peeing** * Cold air in the pool deck or changing rooms, cold showers etc, evaporation of water from skin all cause the skin temperature to drop. This raises blood pressure as less blood flows and the hormone that suppresses urination is reduced. All this causes you to need to pee more. It’s completely normal. * Therefore swimmers need to be more careful about hydration. Experienced swimmers will always drink during training. * Yer Mammy was wrong. You can swim after eating.  All marathon distance swimmers like myself have to eat/take nutrition during swims for example. However, your body will be using air to digest food and use energy for exercise at the same time, so you will feel sluggish at best. **Effort & Diet** * It is extremely common that new swimmers, regardless of or more likely due to prior experience in other sports, underestimate the overall difficulty of swimming and overestimate how much energy they are expending. If you haven’t mastered breathing and are desperately out of breath this does not mean you expending significant energy. * Calorie consumption rates in swimming given by website, apps or wearable fitness trackers or watches cannot be trusted because the variables are too varied. Weight, water temperature, stroke, experience, rests, set and session duration all play a part. I could say it’s almost certainly less than what any of those are telling you for an hour swimming. * Pools are lower than body temperature and conduct heat away. So your body does start using energy to retain heat. The effect lasts after the swim is over. This makes swimming an appetite enhancer. Swimmers notoriously eat a lot. For beginner swimmers, you need to learn to control this. * Most people with a good but average diet will have sufficient energy in blood and liver stores to sustain two hours of high intensity exercise. So it is not essential to “pre-load” in advance of daily swimming **How much should you swim?** * How much you should swim depends obviously on your goals. However since swimming is technically difficult skill, it is safe to say than more swimming is better. * But how much? As a general guideline I recommend four times a week, 2000 metres at a time is a good aim. Beginners won’t be able to swim anywhere near this distance, so let’s say 40 minutes a session. **Injury & other physical problems** * “Swimming is low impact sport, with little chance of causing injury“. This is a widely repeated misconception. Apart from the obvious, front crawl injuries to the shoulders do occur, caused by overuse and poor technique. You can get injured with only a small amount of swimming. * The best ways to reduce the risk are to improve your technique and ALWAYS do a little backstroke each session. Backstroke is a stabilising exercise for front crawl. It helps strengthen the opposing muscles in the shoulder muscles to assist in keeping your shoulders balanced. It does not have to be a good technique to be effective. * Does sleeping on your side cause discomfort? The cause is almost certainly tendonitis. This will not get better by itself, or with rest or by reducing swimming. I recommend some deep tissue massage, direct icing and physiotherapy, in that order as required, with massage & ice fixing ninety percent of problems. * Water in your ear is easiest dislodged by bouncing on the heel of the leg on the same side as the water.

ac622t,"4 days before Christmas 2017 I was diagnosed with cancer of the testicles.   I was a typical ""Gym Powerlifter"".  What I mean by this is that I was decently strong, but heavily overweight.  After I was treated I not only continued trying to get stronger/better, but to also clean up a bit, move down to a more appropriate weight class, and maybe look a little better in the process.  I'd like to believe that in 2018 I accomplished most, if not all, of these goals.  Even if I did it in some...unconventional ways. ***What everyone cares about first, pictures!*** I didn't take a lot of pictures back then (being all fat and stuff), so you'll have to get what you get here. I'm 6'1"" BTW. [November 11 2017:](https://puu.sh/yjKO1/6802dc327c.png)  Its the closest I have to Christmas.  Around 310-320 lbs.  Somewhere between 1100 and 1200 gym total. [December 31 2018:](https://puu.sh/CpOeR/d978feb561.png) Taken just before going out to celebrate my 30th birthday (Jan1).  275 lbs. 1600ish gym total ***How we got here*** Pretty much as soon as I got the news that I had cancer I started cutting weight.  there was a lot of pre-treatment things that needed to be done to try to secure expected experiences of life after my treatment (children for instance)  So up until March when I finally had my surgery, I continued following GZCL Rippler and cutting at around -700.  I made it to around 290-295 before surgery. My first question after I was woken up after surgery was ""how soon can I lift?"" - 2 weeks apparently.  No compounds or abdominal activation for 8. So despite how bad everything hurt, I drug myself to the gym 4 times a week during that 2 week period to just sit there for 30 minutes and keep myself in the habit of being there.  And to keep me from laying in bed and feeling sorry for myself. I gained back to about 300 during this 2 weeks, mostly from not moving and not eating very well (who knew). As soon as I made it to 2 weeks I started basically working upper body and quad isolations.  Tried a few times to figure out a way to work back, but it just wasn't happening without flexing an ab and causing excruciating pain.  I did have about a 6"" incision trying to heal afterall.  I maintained as best I could during this time period, but ended up losing a bit of weight anyway.  Not the best idea for recovering from surgery, but it wasn't really intentional.  I was still getting the hang of manipulating my diet/weight at this point. I hit 8 weeks and got right back on the Rippler and right back to cutting.   When I got down to 290 lbs, I decided to start working with a coach to prep for a powerlifting meet, so I swapped to his programming.  I figured if I wanted to be a powerlifter I should probably actually powerlift. I maintained at 290lbs all the way until about October at which point I told my coach that I wanted to go ahead and make weight so I wouldn't have to stress so much about it during my upcoming meet prep. I went on a very strict 1500 calories, 250g of protein diet.  Consisting of mostly shakes and chicken.  And pickles.  See pickles are zero calories (or close enough) and it kind of feels like you're eating.  So I ate a bunch of them to keep my sanity.  During this month long suicide cut, u/benchpauper started a religion around pickles.  I'm still not sure I completely understand it. I continued going to the gym 4-5x a week during this cut though my volume and intensity dropped off severely.  I also dropped deadlift for a back isolation day during this time frame as I did not feel like I was strong enough at this calorie level to safely perform the movement after about the first 7 days. By the end of October I weighed 260lbs.  Ate a bunch of carbs for a weekend with zero intention of controlling what I ate and hit 268 after full refeed.  Not too bad.  Over November and December, I ate to gain back up to 275 where I'm now maintaining until my meet in April.  Still following coaches program instead of GZCL. Current Caloric intake is between 4500 and 5000 calories per day and the only macro I track outside of that is 250g of protein. Workout program varies from day to day based on my performance and my coach changes it on the fly.  But the days remain roughly the same. Tues:  Volume Bench for compound and chest/tri isolation Wed:  Pullups for compound and back/bi isolation Thurs:  Max Effort bench for compound and shoulder isolation Sun:  Squat/DL for compound and quad/ham isolation For anyone wanting to compete, I cant recommend enough that you get a coach if you can afford it.  I didn't have any major issues with form on any of the lifts, but its astounding what small tweaks from an expert standing right next to you can do.  My squat has gone from my weakest (comparatively) lift to my strongest by far.  425 around the time of the diagnosis to 600+ now and most of that progress came in the first 2 months of being coached.  Nevermind the fact that squats aren't just completely miserable anymore.  (Just mostly miserable) Hopefully I didn't miss anything.  I'm sure if I did, someone will point it out or ask and I can edit it in or answer in a comment.",That part where you went to the gym for the first two weeks 4 times a week and just being there really struck me. That's the definition of dedication and discipline. Great job man!,650
afnh1f,"First off, here’s a [progress pic](https://i.imgur.com/JGQ4DIE.jpg). Taken exactly 3 years apart to the day. Link to an [album of all of my progress pics](https://imgur.com/a/lMyhFQc) Also, some numbers.  |Lifting Start| Current ---|---|----|--- Weight | 135lbs | 165lbs Squat | 115x1 | 390x3 Bench | 75x1 | 265x3 (touch and go) Deadlift | 95x5 | 425x3 (sumo with straps) These are my first lifting numbers but I started my fitness journey at 128lbs. Exactly 3 years ago today, on January 13th 2016 I was browsing r/all and stumbled upon this subreddit. It was a progress post by a redditor that went from very thin to looking like a Greek god. I remember actually looking at myself and for the first time realizing just exactly how skinny I was and that I wanted to change. I took my first ever [progress picture](https://i.imgur.com/uqLFKhp.jpg), read the sidebar, and started the r/bodyweightfitness **recommended routine** that same day. #Timeline: ###The First Few Months - I paid attention to how much I was really eating and noticed it was barely anything. That mixed in with playing soccer/running everyday was not helping. I stepped on a scale, wrote down my starting weight of 128lbs and ate some food. When I started, I was too nervous to go to an actual gym because I didn't know what I was doing and thought that I would constantly embarrass myself/be made fun of for being weak (I was very wrong). So I started with r/bodyweightfitness’ **recommended routine** because I could do it from home. Seriously a really good routine and I still occasionally do it when I am away from the gym for awhile and looking for a workout. (Still can’t hold a handstand though not from lack of trying haha) I definitely got stronger during this time but could not find any of my workout logs. ###April - Mid June 2016 - Around the beginning of April, my buddy and I joined a local gym and started up with **Stronglifts 5x5**.    Started out at the gym weighing 135 lifting just the bar to work on form as **Stronglifts** recommends.  I had tested my limits a bit with a trainer and found that my starting 1 rms were -   Squat |115lbs ---|--- Bench | 75lbs I did not attempt for deadlift.   I followed stronglifts until mid June and ended had made some [noticeable gains](https://i.imgur.com/NgrPWoS.jpg). (Not sure why the photo is so low res sorry)  Weight | 152lbs  ---|--- Squat | 5x5 165lbs Bench | 5x5 135lbs Deadlift | 1x5 225lbs (Not great form)  Around this time life got in the way, I didn’t lift weights again until mid October my senior year of highschool. I did however try and do the recommended bodyweight routine every now and then but wasn’t consistent. ###Mid October 2016 - I started up with **Stronglifts** again because it was familiar. My numbers were  Weight | 145lbs ---|---  Squat| 5x5 135lbs Bench | 5x5 105lbs Deadlift| 1x5 155lbs [Progress Pic](https://i.imgur.com/M4VqAp6.jpg) I stayed on **Stronglifts** wayyyy longer than I should have or that it’s intended for but I liked it and it was quick and easy and I could do it in my school’s weightroom before going home.  ###April - October 2017 - I switched over to the P.H.U.L routine listed in the sidebar and ran that all summer. I really liked P.H.U.L and made some pretty nice progress while running the program. Starting college, I added in another upper body day into the routine and ran that through the end of the year. I hadn’t really seen any major strength gains through this point.   Weight| 165lbs ---|--- Squat | 3x5 235 Bench | 3x5 205 Deadlift | 1x295 (form was not pretty) [Progress Pic from the Summer 2017 ](https://i.imgur.com/b4yj1kv.jpg) [Progress Pic from October 2017 ](https://i.imgur.com/LB6B6x7.jpg) ###November - December 2017 - I made a bad decision and ran a poorly constructed bro split for a few months. No real progress. ###January - April 2018 -  I started nsuns. I love nsuns. I made great progress on nsuns. By the end of April I had made what felt like ridiculous progress.  Weight | 175lbs ---|--- Squat | 310 for 3 reps Bench | 240 for 3 reps Deadlift | 355 for 3 reps [Progress Pic March 2018](https://i.imgur.com/MK5fIAn.jpg) ###May - Mid September 2018 -  This past summer I went on a very long hiking/road trip with my friends and lost close to 15lbs due to lots of intense cardio and not really eating much. I lost a lot of strength and could not lift nearly as much as I used to. The rest of the summer I spent running a more standard 3 day PPL with my brother. [Road trip progress pic](https://i.imgur.com/6I8Su9w.jpg) and [another](https://i.imgur.com/SmfOijf.jpg).  ###Mid September - Now - My real progress came this fall when I started up at Uni again. I made friends with the powerlifting community and made the decision to sign up for my first powerlifting meet in February. I’ve never been so motivated to lift. Starting on Monday September 17th my weight and strongest lifts were -164.   Weight | 164lbs ---|--- Squat | 300 for 3 reps Bench | 225 for 4 reps Deadlift | 315lbs for 3 reps I started back up on Nsuns because I had really liked it and felt like I could still make some crazy progress running the program. The only changes I have made were to change up my accessory exercises every once in awhile to target weak points in my main lifts and to add more volume to whatever lift I felt like was currently struggling.  Right now I am running the Nsuns 6 day Squats variation but with a big focus on bench too. My current stats are  Weight | 165lbs ---|--- Squat | 390 for 3 reps Bench | 265 for 3 reps (touch and go) Sumo Deadlift | 425 for 3 reps (with straps)  [Pic from about a month ago](https://i.imgur.com/WO1kLrW.jpg). [New Picture](https://i.imgur.com/KeKdIC4.jpg). [Another](https://i.imgur.com/BIEmM7v.jpg). Also [Legs](https://i.imgur.com/TsGekuv.jpg). #Diet:  I have always struggled with gaining weight and eating enough food. There have been days where all I would have to eat was a piece of toast and some butter. Diet has always been the hardest part for me as I really enjoy exercise and lifting heavy things. Weight gain has been fairly slow for me because of that and I have to be really on top of things to add the weight. Because of that I’ve never really done a true cut or bulk cycle and have been slow bulking for most of the past three years. I never have really kept track of my macros before besides trying to eat a lot of protein. Because I eat at my university’s cafeterias in addition to cooking myself, it’s a little harder to track to be 100% accurate so I set ranges that I try and fall into.     My current macro targets are as follows. I try and eat between 3700 - 4000 calories a day and shoot for at least 0.8gs of protein per lb. of lean body mass. I often end up eating more protein than is necessary. I also look for more complex carbs and have more carbs than fats. My diet isn’t perfect but it works for me. A typical day looks like this –  ###**Meal 1: Burrito Bowl – 70g protein 1676cal** + 4 servings of Rice 120x4=480 9g P + 1.25 servings of chicken – 150 + 50=200 23g + 1 serving Refried – 140 5g + 1 Serving of Black bean – 120 4g + 1 serving queso – 320 14g + Cheese- 110 7g + 1 serving guac - 150 Protein 4g + Tortilla – 156  Protein 4g + Gatorade (16oz) – 142.5 **Total Meal Calories 1818.5** ###**Meal 2: Protein Packed Rice Bowl - Protein- 40g Calories - 935** + Spinach – 40  4g protein + Hard boiled eggs – 108 + Chicken -  150 + Bacon – 37x2 maybe + Black bean -120 + Rice 2 scoops – 480 + Gatorade (16oz) – 142.5 **Meal Calories 1077.5**  ###**Cliff Protein Bar (Mint Chocolate Flavor)** – Protein -20g Calories 270 ###**Meal 3: Eggs and Toast – Protein - 40g 740cal** + 3 Eggs -240cal Protein -21g + 2 Slices of toast -140cal Protein -5g + 2 servings of peanut butter- 360cal Protein -14g  ###**Daily caloric Intake = 3906cal** ###**Daily Protein Intake = 170g**  #**Current Nsuns workout –**  Currently running accessories based off of a suggested set I found on r/nsuns. It's targeting arms a good amount and I have weaker arms/always wanted bigger arms. I will probably switch my accessories up pretty soon. ###**Day 1 – Bench and Overhead Press** Same as the program. Lots of Sets. **Accessories -**  Incline Dumbbell Press 4x8-12, Seated Cable Row 4x8-12, Super Set Pull Ups 4x8-12 and Tricep Cable Push Down 4x8-12, 21s Bicep Curls (Love this one).   ###**Day 2 – Squat and Paused rep Sumo Deadlift** Like most sumo pullers I am weakest off of the ground so I have incorporated pulling paused rep to help with that. I hate them though lol. **Accessories -** Leg Press 4x8-12, Leg Extensions 4x12 (I go light on these), and Core (Usually ab roller and planks. Sometimes hanging leg raises.) ###**Day 3 – Paused Rep Bench and Overhead Press** I switched from OHP being the main lift to paused rep bench purely because I am trying to get my bench up more for competition. **Accessories -** Incline Dumbbell Press 4x8-12 (sometimes), Cable Crossovers 4x12, Superset Facepulls 4x12-15 and Hammer Curls 4x8-12, Dumbbell Lateral Raises 4x8-12. ###**Day 4 – Sumo Deadlift and Front Squats** **Accessories -** Super set Barbell Rows 4x8-12 and Pull ups 4x6-10, Core (Usually weighted decline bench sit ups) ###**Day 5 – Heavy Bench day and Spoto Press** I used to do close-grip bench but it would aggravate my right elbow a lot and I suffered from some minor tendinitis so I stopped. I switched it to Spoto Press to work on where I normally fail on bench. **Accessories -** Incline Dumbbell Curls 4x8-12, Superset Facepulls 4x12-15 and Cable Overhead Tricep Pulls 4x8-12, Dumbbell Curls 4x10-12 (slow and at a lighter weight)   ###**Day 6 – Squats and Conventional Deadlift** The weight is lighter and this is an easy day. I work on form and speed out of the hole on squat on this day.  **Accessories -** Depends on time. Usually calf raises because I never target them, and Lat Pulldown, and bent over rows.  #**Other Exercise:**  Recreational Soccer once or twice a week. Either a light 15 min jog or an easy 30 mins on a stationary bike 2-3 times a week. #**Other Measurements:** All taken with no pump (taken on rest days/didn't life prior to measurement). All measurements were taken in inches. Taken on random days starting in 2017.  | 2-2-17 | 8-31-17 | 1-15-18 | 3-12-18 | 8-26-18 | 10-3-18 | Today (1-3-18) ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|---- Chest | 36 | 40 | 41.5 | 42 | 41 | 41.5 | 42.5 Arms | 13 1/3 | 14 | 14.5 | 15 | 14.5 | 15 | 15 1/3 Thigh| unknown | 22 | 23 | 24 | 23.25 | 24 | 24.5 Calf| unknown| 15 | 15 | 15 1/3 | 15 | 15 1/3 | 15.5 Weight | unknown | 155lbs | 165lbs | 170lbs | 160lbs | 166lbs | 165lbs Chest- current 43 inches Arm current  15 1/3 inches  Thigh current 24.5 Calf 15.5 **Clothing Size:**  Shirts - I went from mostly wearing men’s x-small and smalls to a mix of mediums and larges. Pants/Shorts - I tend to wear joggers a lot because my legs are big and my waist is small so my jeans/other pants are now either real tight in the leg area or real loose in the waist department.  #**The Future:**  I am planning on switching my program up and start to train heavy singles for my first meet. I also no longer have as much time as time to lift as I previously did, so I will be switching off of **nsuns** soon as it takes forever. I lost some weight over my winter break from school as I fell out of my eating routine, but my lifts didn’t go down which is nice. I am planning on continuing to bulk for the foreseeable future or until I hate how I look as I still have visible ab definition. #**Goals:**   **Short Term -** Not place last at my meet in February lol. **Long term -** I really want to pull a 500+ deadlift, Squat 450, and Bench over 315. This community is a great place and I am really glad that it's been here for me since the start.  Edit: Forgot to mention that I also take Creatine. Also that lifting has made me really like listening to metal now. ","You know this seriously is motivating. I’m a 21 year old guy who’s not fat or in shape, but I’m 6’0, so I carry it well. Appreciate your write up and I’m looking forward to getting started on my serious weight lifting journey when I begin my semester.",776
agg3iz,"To start off, [here](https://imgur.com/a/uH7Pp3b) is my complete (so far) transformation. I have to watermark them, as I have had people on Instagram use my pictures without my consent for advertising. &#x200B; Before I get into the details, I am making this post to show people what is possible if you put your mind towards something. I have made a couple of posts in the past and thought I would make an update. &#x200B; I started really trying to lose weight in January of 2015. I started at 261 lbs and got down to [200 lbs](https://imgur.com/a/tbbj8N9). I then bulked to 230. Following the bulk I cut down to 210 and put on some muscle to get to 215. I am 25 years old now. &#x200B; **How Did I Lose The Weight?** HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training)!!! I cannot stress enough how effective this is. My favorite form of HIIT is sprints. They are simple to do and you can do them pretty much anywhere when there is decent weather. At the beginning I would go to a track at a school by my house and then once I got more comfortable with myself I just did them on my quiet street. I ran the straightaways on the track and walked the turns, and did a total of 8 straightaways to start and eventually worked up to 12 a workout. On my street I would sprint what I thought was about 100 meters and then walked back to where I started from and go again. I would do this anywhere from 8-12 total times depending on how I was feeling. &#x200B; On each leg day I do a variation of HIIT for 10-15 minutes at the end of my workouts, which I do to stay lean and keep my physique. I know I could be much stronger if I were to lower the cardio, but I love looking good as well. I also play hockey once or twice a week for extra cardio. &#x200B; **Programming** As of right now I have been running Candito's Six Week Strength program for the past \~2 years and it has been working great. It allows me to work on my three big lifts while adding in some body building exercises at the end. My main focus is to stay lean, but build strength at the same time, which can be very difficult at times. &#x200B; Recently, I joined my college's power lifting team. I used Candito's program to peak for my first meet back in November.. I have another competition coming up in February, but I am going to switch up my programming a little. I will be running Smalov to get my squat up for the next meet as I find it is falling behind my other lifts.  Along with Smalov I will be running Candito's 6 week program for bench as I have seen great results with it. &#x200B; **Meet Lifts** 445 Squat, 325 Bench 562 Dead weighing in at 212 lb Came 3rd place in my class! &#x200B; **Diet** Breakfast: 5 eggs, Greek yogurt Pre-workout meal: Can of tuna, banana Post-workout meal: Chicken and rice, protein shake Dinner: Some kind of meat with a few carbs (Try and have most of my carbs pre and post workout) Snacks: Protein shake and handful of nuts or seeds, can of tuna and high protein cereal with milk. &#x200B; **Where to go from here?** I am always looking for positive feedback or input on what I could do to improve my physique or strength. If anyone has had success with programs for peaking or you have any input on if I should go up to 230 or down to 205 I would love to hear it! If you have any questions, feel free to ask! IG: @jakeloucks","Amazing job. Good for you. First, and least important, did you get fat enough to have any visible stretch marks from weight loss? I can't see any in the pictures.

I go to Costco once every 2 weeks and then hit up Kroger once a week to fill in the gaps.

Has anyone seen similar research to this previously?","Yup, got back most of my gains from a 3 year hiatus in about 8 months of hard hypertrophy work.

I was sitting/playing video games at home for like 3 years and doing nothing but that and eating. I was about 101kg before I started losing weight, but not with going to the gym. I started doing alot of Bodyweight/Hiit exercises at home while I was in a big caloric deficit like 1000- from my maintanence. That was also the time I started to learn a profession (IT technician) because I no longer wanted to play video games anymore (because I got bored of it). I basically wanted to play real life haha. For the weight loss it was going really good, I lost atleast 0,7-1kg about every 3 days.In total I lost about 34kg. After 8 months I had 67kg and decided that I want to do weight training. So I went to a gym and got a membership. I started @ 01.01.2017 like a new years resolution right? Maybe. I don't like if people set new year resolutions like they need a new year to start something. You don't need a new year to start anything, you can start right now. &#x200B; Anyway my Physique started to change very quickly after joining the gym, that was also the point where I was informing myself about fitness alot like nutrition/training/supplements to maximize my gains. My first split was basically a 4 day bro split. People hate on bro splits alot which is understandable (I would never do them anymore) but for a newbie it was totally okay and I made some good gains. After that I went hardcore and switched to a 6day PPLxPPL. And I made incredible gains with that split. Even though it had alot of volume I managed to do it for 8months or so. (this is where my bench/deadlift started to increase) And right now I'm doing a 4-5 Split (PHUL) which is pretty good for me (alot of Volume). &#x200B; So I don't exactly know what happened in my head that I changed from playing video games non stop to going to the gym and having a life (I guess I was bored from video games) working, living in my own apartment, having a girlfriend but I like it and it was the best decision I ever made, I'm very happy right now. &#x200B; **If anyone is interested in my lifts.** My 1RM right now are: Bench: 90KG (low as fuck I know) Sumo Deadlift: 150kg Sumo Squat: 130kg &#x200B; **I do sumos because I was born with  shortened Achilles tendon and clubfeet, my balance is really bad.** &#x200B; **Body:** 174cm 79,5kg &#x200B; If any of you are in the same position that I was 2 years before or got any questions you may want to ask, feel free to ask. I'm a very helpful kind of person especially when it comes to fitness because it's such an interesting topic for me :) &#x200B; If there were any spelling/grammar mistakes I made, I apologize. I also apologize for not reading the rules first. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B;",Lol at “starting and ending sex: male”,615
an9hb0,"Earlier today I went to the gym after work to get my workout in and some guy approached me wanting to know what I was going to work out. I thought he just being friendly, but then he started asking me about my routine and he get visibly upset when I told him I kind of just do what I feel, don't really have a plan other than ""I'm going to workout X"" today. He went on a rant and went all Eric Thomas on me (For reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vuetQSwFW8) about how it pisses him off that guys at the gym go there without any plan. I was trying to keep things civil, but then he started going on about how I lack ambition and I don't want to change and gave me the ""You do you bro"" and walked away. It was a weird encounter overall.  But it got me thinking if I should have a goal?  I've been working out my entire life and I go through phases where I'm more in cardiovascular shape to a bit heavier and stronger.  I'm 30 years old now and don't have nearly as much time as I'd like to spend at the gym.  I do an hour or so 5 days a week.  I guess if I had to define my goal, it's to stay in shape for now.  Of course, this might change later in the future.   I don't know, I'm just wondering wtf that was all about.  I suspect he was a trainer at the gym, but I'm not sure.","That was a douche move.

aogy0v,"**Before and After (Kind of NSFW I guess):** [https://imgur.com/DDIFp6j](https://imgur.com/DDIFp6j) Before, I was involved in a huge love affair with alcohol and overeating. My sedentary lifestyle certainly didn't help either. After some reflection and a couple alcohol-related incidents, I quit drinking cold turkey and started to take care of myself. Never felt better!! Start Weight: 155 lbs, end weight 145. **Edit - I apologize for the standing position being different in the after shot. I was honestly just too hyped up about flexing to even care about the stance haha. Sorry yall!** **Exercise Routine:** I don’t have access to a full gym, but do have access to a small resort-type gym with a set of dumbbells that go up to 50 lbs, along with some other random equipment. As such, I follow the Fierce 5 Full Body Dumbbell Routine with some modifications. I run this lifting routine only 3 times/week on a rotating basis, so week 1 is workout A,B,A followed by week 2 B,A,B. * Workout A – Walking Lunges, DB Bench, DB Rows, Reverse Flies, Tricep Pushdown, Concentration Curls, Crunches, Bicycle Crunches, Hanging Leg Raise * Workout B – Single Leg Squat, OH Press, Lat Pull Down, Calf Raises, Standing Bicep Curl, Skull Crushers, Weighted Sit Ups, Plank, Hanging Leg Raise * Workout A – Walking Lunges, DB Bench, DB Rows, Reverse Flies, Tricep Pushdown, Concentration Curls, Crunches, Bicycle Crunches, Hanging Leg Raise * Off Days are cardio days – Jump rope/burpees/running. Really, anything to keep my heart rate up and sustained. All in all, the time spend in the gym is around 30-45 minutes, so I really don’t spend a lot of my time in the gym. I really attribute most of my results to the diet. **Diet:** Goal caloric intake – 1,800 cals/day, but I usually get around 1,400 to 1,600. Macro goals – 150+g protein, under 160g carbs, under 60g fat. To achieve this, I have been following more or less the same formula * Breakfast – ½ cup oats with a banana * Lunch – Lean Cuisine (usually chicken-based ones) * Snacks – Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein (2 scoops), Apples, Oranges, Pears, etc * Dinner – Flexible, just as long as it fits my macros (This gives me the freedom to eat Pizza, McDonalds, or whatever I want really) * Pre bed snack – 1 can of Tuna (or 2, if my protein was lacking during the day) **Supplements:** * Protein – Optimum Nutrition Whey (2 scoops) daily * Creatine – Six Star 100% Creatine Monohydrate (5g) daily * Multivitamin – CVS brand One-a-Day Men’s Health Multivitamin (1 pill) daily * PreWorkout – C4 Sport Blue Raspberry (1 scoop) only on lifting days",That is impressive as hell for 3 months. ,1427
aorzzi,"Hey guys, it's been awhile! Hope you are all having a wonderful Chinese new year for those who celebrate. As usual, I've collected a few interesting studies and wrote short summaries of them for all of you to read. All for educational purposes and to spark some discussion. The paper on sleep is not entirely related to fitness but it is health-related and I thought it would be interesting nonetheless. The first study we will look at is a review written by Schoenfeld & Aragon (2018) and it asks the question: how much protein can muscles use for growth in one meal? This is actually a common question thrown around in the fitness world as a lot of people want to be as efficient as possible and want to maximize protein’s effects on muscle growth in each meal. However, as odd as it sounds, sometimes the question is asked incorrectly. For the question above, some people will ask how much protein can be absorbed in one meal as opposed to how much can be used for muscle growth maximally. All protein will be absorbed but the real question is what happens to all of it afterwards. The review highlights the study conducted by Areta et al. (2013) which is commonly cited to say that 20–25 grams of protein is the maximum number that muscles can use for hypertrophy (muscular growth). In this study, trained individuals were given different amounts of protein in a 12 hour period post-workout. Some were supplemented with 10 grams every 1.5 hours, some 20 grams every 3 hours and some 40 grams every 6 hours. In this experiment, the group that consumed 20 grams had the greatest rates of muscle protein synthesis (a fancy term to describe the building of muscles with protein). This would suggest that eating around 20 grams of protein at a time would be the best for building muscle. The biggest limitation that this review noted in the aforementioned study was that the total protein amounts used over the 12 hour period were quite low practically. Individuals training for hypertrophy would be consuming much greater amounts of protein overall. To challenge the previous study, the review presents a paper done by Macnaughton et al. (2016) in which 40 grams of protein elicited greater muscle protein synthesis than 20 grams in the context of full body training. Another experiment carried out by Kim et al. (2016) found that 70g of beef protein showed a more significant anabolic response than 40g of beef protein. However, it should be noted that this response was measured as a whole body response and not just for muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, it is impossible to say which amount is better for muscle protein synthesis in the context of this study. For women, Arnal et al. (1999, 2000) found that one meal with a large amount of protein was better than the same amount spread across several meals in regards to muscle retention. These results are interesting but a limitation to extrapolation is that no resistance training was taking place amongst the subjects. Muscle retention is also similar between those who follow intermittent fasting and those who diet continuously (Seimon et al., 2015). This would suggest that daily protein taken all at once would have the same effects on muscle as spreading out your protein intake across the day. In the end, the authors of this review recommend 0.4–0.55 g/kg/meal which follows daily recommended intakes stated in a meta-analysis produced by Morton et al. (2017). **TL;DR:** It still is not clear what the optimum number of grams of protein per meal for maximizing muscular growth is but 0.4–0.55 g/kg/meal appears to be a safe recommendation based on the current literature. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — We will now eat into a study done by Lee et al. (2018) in which differences between the conventional deadlift and the Romanian deadlift were investigated. For those who do not know what a Romanian deadlift is, it is essentially a normal deadlift starting from the top (barbell at waist) and then descending the barbell down until the hamstrings cannot stretch any further while not flexing at the lumbar spine. The knees cannot bend further than roughly 15 degrees. It may sound like a stiff-legged deadlift, however, in a stiff legged deadlift, you generally start from the bottom and your knees are allowed to bend more allowing you to bring the barbell to the floor. If you are referring to the straight-legged deadlift, the knees would not flex at all and the barbell would not drag along the legs in the descent. The study recruited 21 males with at least 3 years of both conventional and Romanian deadlift experience with their training occurring at least twice a week. The first day involved 1 repetition maximum testing as this would facilitate selecting the appropriate load for the participants during the trial (subjects would be doing 5 reps of each lift at 70% of their 1 repetition maximum). To examine muscle activation, the scientists used electromyography. To put it simply, this is where electrodes are pasted over certain muscles to measure the electrical activity from the muscles. The conventional deadlift showed more activation in the rectus femoris (a quadricep muscle, one that helps extend your knee and flex your hip) and slightly more activation in the gluteus maximus (your butt). Activation of the biceps femoris (a hamstring muscle) was similar between the two lifts which is interesting considering that many believe that the Romanian deadlift helps target the hamstrings better compared to the conventional deadlift. Torque (force produced about a joint) was much higher in the knee for the conventional deadlift which was probably expected considering the knee goes through a much larger range of motion. Similarly, the torque measured at the ankles were also higher in the conventional deadlifts which may suggest higher calf muscle activity though this was not measured in the study. Some important design aspects to note that affect generalizability is that we may see different results with different loads/intensities. Another issue regarding intensity is that the loads were selected according to the 1 repetition maximum of the subject’s Romanian deadlift. Therefore, the conventional deadlift loads may not truly be 70% of their conventional deadlift 1 repetition maximum. It is safe to say that the intensities in this study were likely not matched. Finally, the hamstrings consist of several muscles but only one hamstring muscle was observed during the experiment. **TL;DR:** The conventional deadlift may be better at targetting the quadriceps and the gluteal muscles. Against what is commonly thought, the Romanian deadlift may not be better than the conventional deadlift at hitting the hamstrings, however, more comprehensive electromyography analysis should be done before making a solid statement. EDIT: As pointed out by u/bleearch, the Romanian deadlift may be beneficial for those who have knee problems as you get to enjoy the same hamstring activation while going through less knee torque. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — A large study conducted by Wild et al. (2018) explored the effects of duration of sleep on cognition. The team created a questionnaire which tested various human cognitive aspects like short-term memory, reasoning, spatial working and planning. However, the main areas that were being observed were short term memory, reasoning and verbal ability. At the same time, questions about sleep were asked to see the relationship between the person’s sleep and their cognitive ability. The questionnaire was set up as an online survey in which they were able to gather 10,886 subjects. Firstly, it appears that as a person ages, their sleep duration decreases. All areas of cognition were affected by sleep duration except for short term memory. This is likely because short term memory is a low-order cognitive process, it is not as complex as something like problem solving. Looking at the graphs below, we can clearly see an inverted-U for almost all cognitive areas which tells us that both too little and too much sleep has negative effects on cognition. Even when the authors thinned the analyzed subjects by removing extremes from both ends of the results, they still saw the inverted-U. https://imgur.com/NFHXzuV The most optimal sleep duration for overall cognitive ability according to these results is 7.38 hours. Any duration over 8 hours likely has a negative effect on cognition and the authors were able to reliably find negative effects below 6.26 hours of sleep. It was also highlighted that even a single night of sleep had effects on cognition the next day. People who are chronically poor sleepers can benefit from just a single night of good quality sleep and the same vice-versa (good sleepers are affected by one bad night). Sleeping less than usual or sleeping 2.76 hours more than usual on one night showed negative effects for cognition on average. Despite sleep duration decreasing with age, the results showed that age has no effect on the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive ability. An interesting fact illustrated by this study is that if one were to sleep less than four hours in a night, you would experience a cognitive impairment that is the same as adding 8 years to your age (cognitive ability worsens with age). Clear limitations of this study include the cross-sectional nature of the study (we are only looking at a snapshot of these people’s lives, long term effects of sleep duration are not seen), the lack of people over 70 years old as well as children / adolescents and the fact that all these results were self-reported. Regarding the last point, the authors explain that the self-reporting still has moderate correlation with objective data. **TL;DR:** Getting 7 hours of sleep appears to be optimal for cognition. Sleeping any less or more shows some cognitive deficit. Even a one night’s sleep can show acute effects on cognition. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — The next study is a new meta-analysis done by Grgic et al. (2019) seeing whether or not the time of the day you do your training has an effect on muscle growth or strength. A meta analysis is where you pool the results of several studies together and is generally seen as the greatest form of scientific evidence. Previous research appears to be equivocal in regards to the effects of training time and muscle strength/growth with some studies showing a more positive effect in evening training and some presenting no difference at all between times. In total, the authors collected 11 studies for analysis. At baseline, people were stronger in the evening which suggests that people are naturally stronger in the evening. The authors postulate that this could be due to increased body temperatures in the evening or perhaps some hormonal reason. People who trained in the morning had no difference between strength tests in the morning or evening. However, those who trained the evening were stronger than they were in the morning. This introduces a benefit to morning training as it will make you stronger throughout the entire day in contrast to evening training which would only make you stronger in the evening. In terms of muscle hypertrophy, no differences were found at all. Unfortunately, all of these studies used maximal voluntary contractions to measure strength instead of 1 repetition maximum tests. 1 repetition maximum tests are more practical because they test the strength of movements that you actually train in the gym. There are also not many studies looking at time of training and muscle hypertrophy thus presenting a gap in the literature. Finally, the studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of participants’ ages. **TL;DR:** People seem to be stronger in the evening at baseline, however, unlike evening training, morning training will make you stronger throughout the entire day. Any conclusions regarding muscle growth is difficult to make due to the paucity of research on the subject though for now there appears to be no relationship. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — The last paper we will look at was written by Gonçalves et al. (2017). Caffeine is a stimulant that is often consumed prior to training to boost muscular strength and endurance. Its effects are well documented and the research strongly supports caffeine as a valuable ergogenic aid (Grgic et al., 2018). The paper at hand investigated the effects of habitual caffeine intake on its efficacy during training. In other words, they ask if one were to consume caffeine regularly, would they build a tolerance to it and experience less of its benefits in training? The most likely theory for the way caffeine works is that it binds to adenosine receptors in the body. Amongst many functions, adenosine can make one feel sleepy and even bring down the heart rate of the body. Now, the worries that caffeine may have a reduced effect with habitual intake stem from the process where caffeine use will cause the body to create more adenosine receptors which allows more adenosine to bind to its receptors. The scientists recruited 40 male, trained cyclists to take part in the experiment. The study was designed in a crossover manner and in a double-blinded fashion. A crossover study means that all the participants got to try all treatments. In this case, every subject was supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine for a week, was given a placebo for another week and was given nothing for another week. A double blind simply means that neither the scientists nor the subjects knew which treatment was being administered which helps reduce bias. The cyclists were grouped according to their caffeine intake prior to being recruited into the study. The low intake group consumed 58 mg/day on average, the moderate intake group at 143 mg/day and the high intake group at 351 mg/day. To put these numbers into perspective, the high intake group is worth about 4.5 250ml cans of Red Bull in terms of caffeine. The first day involved some simple body measurements as well as some testing to determine how much the cyclists needed to perform during real testing later on. The next couple of days consisted of familiarization with the time trial tests that the cyclists would have to do. The time trial basically required each cyclist to cycle a certain amount and then the time to completion would be measured. Caffeine 24 hours before the time trial was restricted and a 24 hour dietary recall before each test was also implemented to control caffeine intake. Subjects fasted 6 hours before each time trial and if they were being supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine, it was done 1 hour before the time trial. Rate of perceived exertion was also measured throughout the trial. Cyclists performed 2–3% better when on caffeine compared to placebo/control. There was no difference between placebo and control. Rate of perceived exertion was similar between all treatments. The same trends were seen regardless of caffeine intake habits. That is to say, even they were in the high habitual intake group, the benefits from caffeine were the same. It would appear that regardless of whether or not you consume a lot of caffeine, you can still reap all the ergogenic benefits of the stimulant. However, I am curious to see if we would see the same results in a strength training context. Also, it is worth noting that these results can only be generalized to males. **TL;DR:** Whether you use a lot of caffeine or not, you will not build a tolerance and not experience less benefits during training. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Areta, J.

av1m8l,"Creatine is one of the most widely-used supplements, and for good reason.  It's cheap and it has more research supporting its efficacy than any other supplement out there (except, perhaps, for protein supplements if you don't get enough protein from your diet). However, creatine does a lot of other interesting stuff beyond just helping you train a little harder and build more muscle and strength.  Since there are a lot of questions about creatine on /r/fitness, I thought this article would be of interest for a lot of folks: [Not Another Boring Creatine Guide: Answers to FAQs and Lesser-Known Benefits](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/creatine/) Here's the short version: **Basic Stuff** 1) Creatine primarily works via allowing you to train harder (since it increases the supply of readily available energy for high-intensity contractions).  However, it also has direct effects on signaling pathways that contribute to growth. 2) So far, plain old creatine monohydrate seems to work as well as other fancier (and more expensive) forms of creatine. 3) Assuming you plan on taking creatine long-term, there's not much reason to do a high-dose creatine ""loading"" phase.  Your muscles will attain full saturation in 3-4 weeks anyways. **More Interesting Stuff** 4) Some people are creatine ""nonresponders,"" meaning that creatine supplementation doesn't increase muscle creatine levels.  However, these people tend to be the folks who had higher creatine levels prior to supplementation anyways, so they're not really missing out on anything. 5) Creatine supplementation can actually improve bone health 6) Creatine can improve brain health and mental performance, especially when you're tired or stressed 7) Most of the benefits of creatine (especially the mental and cognitive benefits) seem to be larger in vegetarians and vegans than omnivores (since they're not getting nearly as much creatine from their diet). 8) Creatine doesn't cause dehydration.  In fact, it may actually decrease incidences of heat illness and cramping when exercising in the heat (suggesting it may improve hydration status). 9) Creatine *may* make asthma symptoms worse, though that effect seems to be ameliorated by aerobic exercise. 10) The infamous study which found that creatine increased DHT levels (a hormone associated with hair loss) has probably been blown out of proportion. 11) The effects of creatine *may* be blunted by taking it with high doses of caffeine.  If that's something you're worried about, just taking creatine and caffeine at different times (i.e. caffeine pre-workout and creatine post-workout) should negate that interaction. That's the VERY abbreviated version (the whole article is probably a 20-25 minute read).  Full disclosure:  the article is published on my website.  However, I did not write it.  The author, Eric Trexler, has his PhD in exercise physiology, and most of his research is in sports nutrition and supplementation (including research on creatine).  So, I'm clearly biased about this article, but the author is an actual expert on the topic.

My heart rate is picking up a lot and I'm sweating so I think its doing something for me but let me know what you all think. any feedback is appreciated (first post here)  [EDIT] I really appreciate all the tips and nice things everyone had to say. Thank you all for taking time out of your morning to try and motivate me it really hit me and I'm more motivated than ever! [EDIT:2] Hey everyone stopping by! This thread got way more attention than I thought it ever would. I'm sorry if I dont reply to everyone's comments but I am definitely reading all of them. I'll post a progress report in a month or so. Wish me luck, and thank you all again!","This sounds like a good start! Make sure to pay attention to how your ankles, knees, and hips feel bc at your weight those joints can be under a lot of pressure and new exercise can be a strain. But if they feel okay, awesome.

azk9no,"I'm trying to find new exercises to help with my gains. My regime is always the same every week and I'm getting a little tired of the reptitiveness of my workouts.

I know squat, deadlift, pull ups, bench press, and overhead are essentials, but what are some other beneficial exercises? ",Facepulls for healthy shoulders. ,3179
b1s85s,"[So first, the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5DY0rYVG3c) **BACKGROUND** I'm a strongman competitor, and before that was a powerlifter, and before that I trained MMA.  Been an athlete for a while, and have been training the overhead press itself since about 2007.  I remember reading Pavel Tastousline say that pressing your bodyweight overhead was a sign of getting strong, and that initially became the goal. I've been chasing this goal for 3 years, ever since Kalle Beck threw it down in Starting Strongman.  At the time, I could manage 7 reps, and I assumed it was right around the corner.  However, I got big into competing in strongman, so my strict press got deprioritized and then I blew out my ACL, so training got a little different.   **TRAINING** I have been SO close to this number for a long time.   What seemed to finally break me through was 18 weeks of running the Deep Water program (which I've reviewed in detail here on r/fitness.  You can find the [Beginner program here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9ry1st/review_of_jon_andersens_deep_water_beginner/), [intermediate program here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/a6aumc/program_review_jon_andersens_deep_water/), and the [Advanced program here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/ak7he7/program_review_deep_water_advanced_program/) ) Prior to running Deep Water, and then post Deep Water, my press training was based around 5/3/1.  I'd work up to a topset and do a PR set there, and then I'd do a FSL PR set after that, to get in more volume.  For this particular training cycle, I've been doing a Second Set Last (SSL) PR set, rather than a FSL set, just to get training with slightly heavier weight.  I do my best to try to make the reps match on the topset PR set and the SSL set. Between those sets, I'll superset with a set of 20 band pull aparts.  After the heavy pressing, I'll run a giant set of more strict pressing followed by dips followed by lateral raises.  Really just trying to get in a lot of volume and fatigue in a short amount of time.  The only other pressing I'll train during the week is bench, which these days I'm using the same benching program that was in Deep Water.  It's 3 sets of flat bench, 3 sets of close grip, 3 sets of incline, then 3 sets of dips.  Hits things from all sorts of angles. **LESSONS LEARNED AND PASS ALONGS** I see a lot of folks struggling with pressing, and after hitting my head against the wall for a few years before coming out of nowhere and smashing this PR, I think the big takeaway is to quit spending so much time focused on moving heavy weight and get in some volume.  Deep Water had me using 70% of my 10rm for all my work sets, which was around 55% of my 1rm, but I was using it for 10x10.  It was a ton of volume, I put on some good weight, and coming off of it, now that I'm focused on moving heavier weight, I have a MUCH larger amount of room the progress. Intensification works by pulling from the volume you've accumulated.  The greater the accumulation, the greater the intensification effect.  If you don't have a deep well to pull from, you won't go far.  If you've been struggling with your press, try to spend a LONG training cycle really hammering the volume on ALL your pressing muscles and eating well, and then come back.",holy fuck 10 reps of bw press?

b3fwmo,"Hi Reddit! &nbsp; I want to post my progress. Reddit has taught me how to be healthier and become fitter. I want to summarize all the DOs and DONTs that I have learned on reddit during my weight loss journey. Making this post is also kind of a self-therapy for me. I am still a fitness beginner and started working out about half a year ago. Please feel free to give me any kind of advice and take my advice with a grain of salt. &nbsp; --- #**Stats** --- &nbsp; *Body Stats* | Sex | Ethnicity | Age | Height | Weight | BMI :--------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------: **Before** | Male | Southeast Asian | 22 | 181 cm / 5'11 | 92 kg / 203 lbs | 28.1 **After** | Male | Southeast Asian | 27 | 181 cm / 5'11 | 75 kg / 165 lbs | 22.9 &nbsp; *Est. 1RMs* | OHP | Squat | Bench | DL :--------|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------: **Before** | - | - | - | - **After** | 30 kg / 66 lbs | 90 kg / 198 lbs | 60 kg / 132 lbs | 70 kg / 154 lbs &nbsp; [Weight Loss Graph](https://i.imgur.com/zWYV1vr.png) &nbsp; --- #**My Story** --- &nbsp;   **[March 2014 | 92 kg]** I was at the lowest low in my whole life. I started to go to college in 2011 but I fucked up. I got addicted to video games and all I did was sitting in front of the computer all day and eating junk food all the time. I dropped out of school and became an obese NEET. Since I started School I went up 20 kg until I was 92 kg. Note that as an asian male a BMI higher than 27 indicates obesity. But all I cared about was playing League of Legends and I did no physical activity whatsoever. I had no girlfriend, no friends, nothing. Then my money ran out and I moved back to my parents. I started playing Volleyball again and I lost some pounds but it was an up and down. I didn't know anything about CICO until &nbsp; **[February 2017 | 88 kg]** At some point I was at 82 kg but then I stopped playing Volleyball and I landed on 88 kg. Almost 3 years have past and I have lost only 4 kg? Then I read on Reddit that in order to lose weight I have to burn more calories than I consume according to physics and shit. They called it CICO. That was when I installed MyFitnessPal. Now I knew I had control over my weight. But it was still an up and down. I went down to 78 kg and thought: ""Wow, this is going so well, I don't need this app any more."" Then I stopped using MFP and my weight went up again. Me and MFP - that was an on/off kinda thing. Look at the Graph from above. You can literally tell when I stopped tracking my calories... The lowest weight I have ever achieved was &nbsp; **[August 2018 | 74 kg]** This was great. But the problem is that I am weak and I have never lifted properly in my life before. I was also the stereotypical kind of skinny fat asian male. I live in Germany and went to USA, CA, for a semester abroad. My school had a free gym and so I went there regularly. My roommate, who was into Fitness introduced me to a 3x5 Beginner Program and I followed it very strictly. He also told me to bulk up and eat more. And since I am in the States I had plenty of Fast Food options to dirty Bulk. Nice, I can eat whatever I want again!!! Boy was that a mistake. &nbsp; **[December 2018 | 80 kg]** I made good progress doing this beginner program. I was soon able to squat and DL my bodyweight with 5 reps. It felt great. But then.... BAM!!! Lower Back Injury. I couldn't do DL and Squats any more and my back hurt so much I had to take a break from Fitness. I also realized how much fat I gained over the last few months. I will never dirty bulk again. I needed to cut and work on my form to lower the risk of injury. I also wanted to work out harder. In January 2019 I went back to Germany. &nbsp; **[March 2019 | 75 kg]** The cut progresses kinda slowly because I didn't track my calories accurately. From now on I will measure every drop of Soy sauce I put into my food... I weighed myself today: 75 kg. I am finally at normal weight again but I am still Skinny Fat (~ BFP of 20%). I need to get rid of this fat and bulk up again, cleanly. It is so frustrating to feel like I have to start all over again just because I did a stupid dirty bulk. So much time wasted. Well, we learn from our mistakes. Last week was the first time I did Deadlifts again since my lower back injury. I will take it slow with a 5/3/1 progress. Also, I quit the 3x5 beginner program which mainly consisted of doing 6 compound exercises, i.e. I was just spending 30 minutes in the gym 3 times a week. I have more time than that. So why should I not work out harder? It can only be beneficial and help me lose weight. That is why I looked at all the well-known workout routines and used them as an inspiration to create my own routine. &nbsp; **All in all** I have made a lot of mistakes. In the last 5 years I failed several times over and over again. But hey, life goes on. In 2014 I started a new major and now have a Bachelors degree in Mathematics and graduated with distinction (GPA of 3,92). I finally found some friends. I overcame my gaming addiction. I am have a healthy body weight. I learned a lot on reddit about [how to date](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6arbil/what_is_the_best_dating_advice_youve_ever_received/), [how to dress better](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/), [which exercises are the most beneficial](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/azk9no/whats_an_exercise_that_everyone_should/), [how to lose weight](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6pft8f/serious_which_weight_loss_tricks_actually_worked/), how to please a woman, flossing...

There are so many friendly and experienced people here, who can give you excellent advice. Read the transformation posts. Educate yourself. * **Start tracking your calories and macros.** Non-negotiable. * **Watch youtube Videos in order to learn the exercises.** And rewatch them again and again! Everytime I watch a video I can only remember about half of the stuff these guys tell me. Whenever I feel insecure abobut an exercise I would watch a Video about it right before performing it. It has helped me a lot. * **Use a fitness tracking app.** Track your progress. I use fitnotes. * **Let a Fitness trainer check your form on the compound Lifts.** Especially on Squats and DLs! I never knew what I was doing wrong that I injured my back a few months ago. I never rounded my back during my Deadlifts. But when I asked a staff member of my gym to check my form, they told me I did the opposite mistake: I was arching my back too much needed to activate my abs more and breathe properly. This shit doesn't get much attention in these popular Fitness videos on youtube and can stop your progress due to injury. * **Work on your Posture.** Having a good posture makes you look more muscular, is healthy and therefore makes you more attractive. * **Ask for people to spot for you.** * **Ask if you can share a rack with someone.** Most people will let you work in. * **Control your appetite.** If you want to lose weight, drink 2 or 3 glasses of water before each meal. Eat with a smaller fork and use smaller plates. Eat slowly and make pauses during your meal. Allow your stomach to have time for the satiety to kick in. * **Look for healthy snacks to reduce your cravings.** Eat celery Sticks and apples dipped into [PB2](https://www.amazon.com/PB2-Powdered-Peanut-Butter-16/dp/B077BYBCGZ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=pb2&amp;qid=1553105405&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1).

Every time I stopped tracking, my weight went up again (see graph above). Since you are losing so much weight already, you will think you're good. You think you may stop tracking now because you believe you know how to estimate your calories. If I would have kept counting those kcals I would have hit my goal weight 1 year ago. Time is too valueable to make other peoples mistakes. Please don't stop. * **Do not worry about what others think of you in the gym.** And outside the gym as well. Don't let your ego get in your way.

b472fr,"Hi everybody, I made this post a few days ago on [/r/bodyweightfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/b2z06d/pike_pushups_are_an_excellent_progression/) and it was a huge hit, so I'm sharing it with you here as well.  ## Link to the complete blog post here: https://antranik.org/pike-pushups/ As a fun experiment, I did Pike Pushups as the only progression exercise to see how many it would take to translate to a single Handstand Pushup (HSPU). I documented that entire journey in a 3 part series on my blog [here](https://antranik.org/tag/hspu/) and as I got intimately acquainted with this exercise, I put together all the things I learned along the way to help you succeed with it too! So in this post I will point out what is proper form & how to set yourself up for consistency, so here goes! ###Pike pushups are more technical to setup and execute than expected * Changing any single one variable can make the exercise seem a lot easier or harder so having a consistent setup is crucial for success. And because it’s a difficult exercise, it’s easy to do it with bad form without even realizing the body is taking shortcuts.  * Some people find pike pushups so frustrating to master that they resort to doing the barbell equivalent, the overhead press, because they can incrementally increase the load on the bar with far fewer variables to deal with. I’m here to help you to not experience that frustration. ###Pike pushups done with proper form are deceptively hard. * I mean like, *really* hard. It's very difficult to perform them with proper form. *So hard in fact that most demonstrations on YouTube are shown with poor form.*  * **[GIF: Demonstration of Pike Pushup](https://gfycat.com/ifr/DimThirdIvorybilledwoodpecker)**  #*Section 1: How to do Pike Pushups with Proper Form* **Form Check #1: Just like with normal pushups, the elbows should not be flaring out to the sides** * Since this is a progression exercise toward handstand pushups, it's important to note that a real handstand pushup will never be performed with the elbows flaring outwards. As such, during pike pushups, the forearms or elbows shouldn't be moving backwards or flaring out to the sides as well. They should remain vertical and fairly static. * To facilitate this, turn the hands out slightly so the index finger faces forward. You can even make it more extreme so the thumb faces forward if your wrists are bothered. * **[GIF: Bad Form / Good Form, Front View](https://gfycat.com/ifr/ElectricOddballFly)** **Form Check #2: Your head should go MUCH MORE FORWARD than you think is enough** * This is definitely the #1 offender of all: people dip their head down to go between their hands. No. Stop that. The head should not go down between your hands. The head should go *forward* and down. So far forward that your head ends up ahead of the fingers. So far forward that the elbows don't move backwards whatsoever but maybe they even go forward a teensy bit when you're even stronger.  * When in doubt, go more ahead than you think you can. (In any harder variation, like a hollowback press or bent arm planche, your head will need to go even more forward.) * **[GIF: Bad Form / Good Form, Side View](https://gfycat.com/ifr/ThisVacantFalcon)** * What happens if you put your head straight down between the hands? The elbows flare out to the sides and it increases the strain on the elbow and shoulder joints. You'll be able to do more reps with this improper form, misleading you to think that you're stronger than you actually are. (Remember, this exercise is deceptively hard when done right.) **Form Check #3: Your nose should touch the ground** * Rather than aiming for the top of the head to touch the ground, have the nose touch it. You get more range that way. **Form Check #4: Practice full range of motion (ROM)** * This goes without saying. Press up until arms are straight and the shoulders are over the wrists. #*Section 2: How To Set Yourself Up For Consistency* **Setup Tip #1: Start with (Feet-Elevated) Decline Pike Pushups** * Doing pike pushups with feet on the ground is OK but I suggest you start with decline pike pushups where the feet are slightly elevated. This will mitigate any hamstring flexibility issues and make the exercise feel less awkward. * Even if the flexibility is not an issue, I highly recommend it. Also, one should be comfortable with regular pushups. * If you have been doing pushups properly, [the way I recommend,](https://youtu.be/4dF1DOWzf20) then you have a solid base. **Setup Tip#2: The hands should be about shoulder width apart** * Setting the hands far wider than shoulder width will feel easier because there's less range of motion. * Setting the hands narrower than shoulder width will feel very difficult and is an advanced variant. * Keep the hands at around shoulder width apart for optimum range and intensity. **Setup Tip #3: Choose an object you could elevate your feet on and stick to that height** * I put my feet on a chair (about knee height) and did that for 6 weeks minimum before elevating the feet onto the couch (about hip height) and doing that for 6 weeks. * **[Pic: Left: Feet elevated to knee height \(on a chair\) is about 77% of my bodyweight. Right: With feet at hip height \(on couch\), this is about 83% intensity. ](https://i.imgur.com/e3ywcH3.jpg)** * The difference between the above settings for the feet is only ~6% which doesn't sound like much, but it is considering the chair-setting is already quite difficult at ~77% intensity so don't start at the highest possible setting. This exercise is humbling. The height of the feet should be the same for a while. **Setup Tip #4: Place the feet near the edge of the platform** * When I was using a chair, I would make sure my feet were placed right near the edge of the chair. If I placed the feet further back, toward the middle of the chair, the exercise would be far easier. * When I elevated the feet to hip height, I was using the side of my couch. Luckily, arm-rest was narrow so I couldn't set my feet too far back or forth.) **Setup Tip #5: If using a movable object to put your feet on, always place them in the same spot.** * When I was using a chair, I would place the legs of the chair exactly at the edge of the carpet each and every time. Then, my feet would go at the end of the chair and my hands would go on the same spot on the carpet everytime. And finally, when doing the actual pushup, my nose would always hit the same spot on the carpet as well. * **[GIF: Example of what constitutes a Consistent Setup](https://gfycat.com/ifr/PortlyImpureItalianbrownbear)** **Setup Tip #6: Use a landmark for where your nose should touch for each and every rep.** * Do this to ensure you're going forward enough. On the carpet, I chose a pattern to aim for. One inch forward or backward makes a huge difference so I always made sure I was going forward enough * On a smooth floor, I use a piece of invisible tape to mark the spot. * **[Example Pic: This is how I chose to remember where to place my hands and nose each time.](https://i.imgur.com/6vazB47.jpg)** **Setup Tip #7: The distance of the hands from the feet should always be the same.** * Setup the hands close enough to almost be an L-shape, but not tighter than an L-shape. (This was a distance of about 36"" (1 meter) for me. Your mileage may vary.) **Setup Tip #8: Don't place the hands too close to your feet even if your flexibility allows for it.** * The closer you bring the hands to the feet, the harder the exercise becomes. So you might think closer is better to maximize the intensity. But it's not the best course of action for consistency sake because placing your hands further back makes the exercise exponentially harder as mere millimeters change the load *significantly*. * If your hamstring flexibility and pike compression is great and you can compress yourself tighter than an L-shape, you may be tempted to make the exercise harder by simply moving your hands backwards, but the inconsistency can cause frustration and make you think you're weak, so don't do it. * Note: I'm not saying you should NEVER bring your hands close. Eventually, you will be able to place your feet close to your hands, do a pike pushup and lift your feet up and press up into a handstand. You can even ""teeter totter"" like that if you stay piked and are obscenely strong. But you need to choose a setting that's going to help you get the reps in. #Tempo Tips * **[GIF: Demo of Appropriate Tempo to Aim For](https://gfycat.com/ifr/CreativeCourageousDragonfly)** * **Don't rush the negative phase.**  * Slow down the negative phase so it takes a solid 2-3 seconds rather than just one second or less. In doing so you build more strength and make better use of your time. * **Pause at the bottom occasionally**  * This strengthens you in the hardest part of the exercise and forces you to press up using all your strength without utilizing the elastic nature of your muscular tissues because you made all the potential energy dissipate from pausing. * **Explode up with good form**  *  In the beginning it was hard to push quickly. It was actually impossible. But the intention is what matters. I tried to pushup as fast as possible and although it was slow, it got slowly faster. It wasn't until exactly one month into the training where I was pushing actually faster for the first time during the concentric phase. After 3 months, I could feel the quality of my strength had changed dramatically. I could muster through reps where otherwise it would've failed in the past and perform the concentric faster than ever. So there you have it!

b5fbyk,"I've struggled with ongoing depression for a while now and about a year ago it got really bad, I was seriously contemplating suicide and that thought alone made me very scared. I felt like I had no one to care about and nothing to care about. I was small, weak, played video games all day and had stopped caring for my health. Simply put, life wasn't great. I'd always been teased about being skinny, mostly from my family. They liked to criticize me on my frail appearance. Anyways, one day as I was browsing reddit I stumbled across the beginners guide in this particular sub and I remember thinking to myself: 'that doesn't look so hard. I bet I could do it.' I'm not sure what clicked in my head; maybe I was tired of all the verbal abuse or maybe I just needed a reason to get out of the house. Whatever the reason, I decided to give it a shot, to try going to the gym. I got off my ass and headed to the nearest 24 hr gym I could find (I wanted it to be a 24hr gym because then I could go very early and be on my own, unjudged) I talked to the manager and signed up for a 1 week trial. I'm not going to lie, the first day there I felt like an idiot, I went in at 4 am thinking that no one would be there and to my surprise the gym was full of none other than cops (probably training before their shift started). Seeing the cops made me very frightened but I pushed through it and got my first ever workout in. I explicitly remember bringing a piece of paper with me where I had hand drawn all the exercises with stick figures so I could remember how to do them. Even with my notes, I sucked, big time. But something made me want to see how much I could lift, how far I could push myself and eventhough my entire body hurt after the workout I got up the next morning, again, at 4am an walked into the gym. From that point on I've been hooked, I love the gym, I love powerlifting, I love it all. And even though I'm still not great and my numbers are fairly average, I love walking in every day and seeing myself slowly get better.  To this day, I still struggle with depression, especially recently after my S.O and I broke up, but at least now I have a rock to rely on, an activity that no matter what, I know I'll enjoy and be happy with. So thank you so much to each and every one of you, to the mods, the users and even the shitposters because if it wasn't for all of you, I dont know if I would even be alive right now. With love, Xerg Tldr: was struggling with depression and thanks to r/Fitness got off my ass and started working out, not sure if I would be here today if it wasn't for that.","No, you saved your life. r/fitness might have given you the idea but didnt lift those weights.

Years ago I've personally had my fair share of wrist sprains (and shared all the tips I've amassed for dealing with that [here](http://antranik.org/wrist-sprains/)) and I'm happy to say that not only are **wrist sprains a distant memory AND stronger than ever** for the past couple years so I'd like to share how I did it with these 2 simple and effective bodyweight exercises!  # 1. Palm Pulse Progressions: https://youtu.be/xLQkpuDS1PY Palm Pulses will strengthen and stretch your wrists and knuckles (MCP joints). They're often perfect for doing on hands and knees, but too big of a jump in intensity for doing them in plank, but with this progression (demonstrated in the video), you will narrow the gap and see progress very fast! * Progression:  * Palm Pulses on Hands and Knees  * Palm Pulses Slow Negatives in Plank  * Palm Pulses in Plank **Tip:** If you are severely lacking flexibility to move the palms up, stretch each finger backwards individually beforehand.  # 2. Back of Hand Wrist Pushup Progressions: https://youtu.be/T58Gmo77Iow These back of hand wrist pushups are extremely good at stretching *and* strengthening your wrists and the **extensor muscles** (muscles on top of forerm) which are generally weak relative to our flexors, so it's a really great exercise to counter all the hanging/pulling/climbing work we tend to do (the imbalance of which is often the cause of tennis elbow/lateral epicondylitis). Plus this will increase the wrist flexibility one requires for the **false grip** if the wrist-flexion range is lacking. * Progression:  * on Hands and Knees  * Against a wall, chest height   * The more you walk back or lower you place your hands on the wall, the harder.  * In Plank Note: Simply holding this position might feel very intense if you aren't used to it. Aim to have the elbows straight the best you can, breathe, and do a little bit each day and you'll progress. #Tip for both exercises: * In regards to tempo, do not speed through these and don't use momentum. Emphasize a slow and controlled pace for complete mastery. * Aim to do a couple sets in the morning as part of a simple daily routine for consistency.  * The intermediate progressions may feel really difficult and you might not be able to do many reps, but you'll notice an increase in form quality, better tempo control or number of reps with nearly every session. Armed with these two simple and effective exercises that have their own progression pathway, you now know enough to keep your wrists healthy and strong! Hope that helps! #If you have sprained your wrist... * You should definitely get it checked out by a doctor or physiotherapist and if they say it's a sprain, check out my article on [how to deal with wrist sprains.](http://antranik.org/wrist-sprains/) I was/am a very active and my wrists always got used but I didn't used to know about the importance of warming them up and neglected wrist mobility work, so eventually they would be the first thing to get hurt. As a result, I learned a lot about the healing process and the importance of rest and the emotional struggle, so check it out if you end up with sore/achey wrists a lot.  * Another free resource I have is [how to avoid the wrist pain](https://antranik.org/avoid-wrist-pain/) in the first place when you're doing bodyweight exercises. That way you'll learn how to warm them up, how to apply pressure appropriately so you don't dump all the weight on the wrist bones and how to modify pushups if your wrists hurt.",Thisll be great for helping with my front squat form.

blyawc,"**Background** I’ve been lifting weights consistently since the beginning on 2015, with a focus on powerlifting (though I haven’t competed) since June of 2015.  I grew up skinny, and was ~175lbs (6’3) when i was a senior in high school. By the time i started lifting i was around 235lbs of mostly beer and fat from a college lifestyle. I cut to around 220 in 2015, then slowly ate my way up to where I am now around 249 or so. Safe to say I’ve been bulking or recomping for a majority of the time I’ve been lifting.  **Lifting** I started out with a bro split and had a lot of fun doing that for a while. Had a coach for just under a year, and trained similarly to Sheiko’s templates. Currently running a relatively high volume Upper Lower x3 split during which I deadlift once, bench twice, and squat twice.  **Deadlifts** [First recorded deadlift - June 2015](https://streamable.com/9rymp) some nice folks from my commercial gym taught me to deadlift and I believe this was my first “form check” [First 405 - August 2015](https://streamable.com/tee2q) at this point my approach was maxing every single time I deadlifted. Pretty garbage in hindsight, but I added weight consistently. Training in general was pretty haphazard at this point [Switch to sumo, 525 - February 2016](https://streamable.com/71y50) this was a pretty huge milestone for me. I had pulled 500 conventional a few weeks prior.  At this point, I hit my first plateau and start to learn a bit more about linear progression and volume, etc etc.  I pulled 2x a week for a while, once conventional from a deficit and another sumo. Did a lot of 10s and 8s and focused on setting rep PRs whenever possible.  [Broke the plateau - 555 - October 2016](https://streamable.com/5mo8s) after some rep prs and a small back injury, I broke the 525 sticking point and pulled this. Felt like I had more in the tank, tried to double it a month later. Failed.  [600 - December 2016](https://streamable.com/wuk4y) one of my favorite lifting days ever. 315 bench on this day as well. At this point I had a coach for a bit. He had a very high volume approach to deadlifts and I was pulling 2x a week with a lot of pauses and volume. Hurt my lat in June of 2017 and took some time off.  [635 - August 2017](https://streamable.com/72yp9) second time deadlifting back from lat injury for this unplanned PR. Felt good, almost dropped it. After this I switched to hook grip for good This started my longest ever plateau. I tried a bunch of shit (sheiko style programming, pauses, deficits, pulling sumo 2x a week) and nothing seemed to work. Hurt my hamstring twice (April and June 2018), took some time off and went back to my bro split roots (my current UL split)  From then on I’ve been doing RDLs once a week as a secondary lift on a squat day and doing primarily paused sumo on my Saturdays for my heavy deadlift work. Both the RDLs and paused sumo are linearly progressed building up to a rep PR / 1RM every few months.  [660 - November 2018](https://streamable.com/hmc57) [700 - April 2019](https://streamable.com/cbic3) by far the most exciting thing I’ve ever done in the gym.  **Other lifts** 505 Squat (on an SSB because I suck)  405 Bench (touch and go)  440 Front squat Body comp changes - http://imgur.com/M8o81eq The before pic is 2012, so a few years before I started training.

bm7ydx,"Hi I’m 25 Male who is an ex athlete from highschool that wants to get back in shape.   Decided to go to a boxing gym cause I had so much fun during the intro class plus it was a good sweat. So I signed up, went to the 15 rounds boxing class and threw up on my first day.  It was a little embarrassing but I want to go back.  I think my mind still thinks I’m athlete but my body is like slow down. My question is.... How often should I go back and train to see results?  I know you can’t out train a bad diet so I have been eating lighter and less,  and found a subreddit for cheap and healthy foods that I want to start prepping. My reasons for joining were to get back in shape, prepare for a tough mudder, and hopefully meet some people and extend friend circle. Any advice or comment or answer to the question above would be awesome  I am thinking about going every other day,  cause today on rest day I felt like everything was sore. Edit 1:  Holy cow.

I wanted to give you all an update on my journey to sobriety and wellness. It's 6 months in, and I am very proud to report that I'm still alcohol-free and still hitting the gym. &#x200B; **Here are my 6 month before/after photos (Kinda NSFW I suppose)** [**https://imgur.com/a/poInCR9**](https://imgur.com/a/poInCR9) Height: 5 ft 5 inches Age: 28 Pounds lost: 30 (165-135) Bodyfat: 11.5% &#x200B; **Exercise Routine** Not long after my original post, I maxed out my small gym's dumbbells (they went to a max of 50 pounds), so I switched to a new routine that places major emphasis on bodyweight and HIIT training: *Workout A:* Dips, Pike Pushups, Push Ups, Step Ups, Pistol Squats, Dragon Flags, Suspension Tricep Extensions *Workout B:* Pull-ups, Suspension Rows, Suspension Curls, Suspension delt flies, Active hangs, Planks, Dumbbell Deadlifts I run this routine twice/week, with a rest day in the middle: A, B, rest, A, B, rest, rest. I do workout on an empty stomach though, as I believe (with absolutely no data to back it up lol) that it helps with burning fat off. All exercises are 4 sets of 20 (except for the Dragon Flag - if I can get 3 sets of 2 or 3, I'm thrilled haha). For some of them, such as pull-ups, I'll try my best to get 20, but usually, fall short. I try to keep my heart rate up, so I usually power through the workout in 30 minutes or less. I recently bought a 40 lb weighted vest though, so that's causing me to do less reps (10) &#x200B; **Diet:** My diet hasn't changed much, but on the recommendation of many Redditors, I stopped with the Lean Cuisine and started meal prepping fresh meals. Goal caloric intake – 1,800 cals/day, but I usually get around 1,400 to 1,600. Macro goals – 150+g protein, under 160g carbs, under 60g fat. * Breakfast – Breakfast shake (Greek yogurt, protein powder, bananas, fresh fruits, almond milk, and flax seed) * Lunch – One chicken breast with 1 cup cooked brown rice * Snacks – Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein (2 scoops), Apples, Oranges, Pears, etc * Dinner – Flexible, just as long as it fits my macros (Usually a home cooked meal though, my favorites are Pork Tenderloin or Shrimp Stir Fry) * Pre-bed snack – Carrots, Celery, or the occasional can of Tuna (although once in a while I cheat and have ice cream or of chips...gotta cheat once in a while to remain sane!) **Supplements:** * Protein – Optimum Nutrition Whey Vanilla Ice Cream (2 scoops) daily * Creatine – Six Star 100% Creatine Monohydrate (5g) daily * Multivitamin – CVS brand One-a-Day Men’s Health Multivitamin (1 pill) daily * PreWorkout – Six Star Explosion Ripped (1 scoop) only on lifting days &#x200B; As a side note - you all have been a huge help in my reaching my goals.

Originally it's a basic powerlifitng program 4 days a week with bench 3 times, squat twice, dead lift twice, OHP once, bent over row twice and cable row twice. I swapped some rows for pull ups, and bent over rows with Pendlay rows. It increases volume until i peak, then increases intensity with lower volume until i max out at the end. If you want to see all 9 weeks check out the link above. ##I highly recommend the above program, added 60lbs to my dead lift, 20lbs to my bench.

bnvq91,"DISCLAIMER???: Back in 2016 (19 years old) I worked out for about two months and just ate normally (probably at a caloric surplus). **I feel that my face has changed tremendously (this is obvious since I've lost weight), but I have also incorporated mewing for the past 3 months and have seen great results. This is the reason why I have chosen not to hide my face.** &#x200B; [Progress](https://imgur.com/a/vi5H0IH) [Extra Progress Pics](https://imgur.com/a/5WAqiwi) &#x200B; **IMPORTANT POINTS:** **Youtubers** I watch (not as to promote them but this is how I learned most of what I know): Eric Bugenhagen (GODLY), Jeff Nippard & Cavalier (form & knowledge). **MUSIC: Metal & Hard-style --- Favorite band: Unleash the Archers** (In all seriousness they might be the greatest source of my gains). &#x200B; First off I'd like to apologize for the inconsistencies of the before and after pictures, back when I first started this lifestyle (November 7, 2018) I did not think of taking progress pictures nor was I confident in taking such pictures, as you can see that has changed through the plethora of fuck-boyish faces and poses I've taken recently. &#x200B; Back in October 27th, 2018 I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years and this lead me to a dark place filled with uncertainties and confusion. This is the reason as to why I chose a healthy path and try to better myself, this is what initially motivated me. &#x200B; I lived in a third world country until I was 9 years old (relevant because I used to be very skinny), when I got to Canada I quickly became fat, gained weight rapidly, and never participated in any type of physical activity because I enjoyed playing video games so much, when I wasn't at school I'd be at home playing video games. My body has been mostly consistent for the past 8 or so years of my life, though throughout university I did gain a lot more weight. &#x200B; Stats November 7, 2018: 5'5"" 158lbs |Conventional Deadlift (1RM): 175lbs|Sumo Deadlift (1RM): Did not test because I didn't know how to sumo, if I had to guess it would be around 175lbs because my sumo had always been weaker until I started training it 3 weeks ago.| |:-|:-| |Squat (1RM): 135lbs|Bench (1RM): 105lbs| &#x200B; Stats May 10, 2019: 5'5"" 135lbs |Conventional Deadlift (1RM): 295lbs|Sumo Deadlift (1RM): 315lbs| |:-|:-| |Squat (1RM): 265lbs|Bench (1RM): 205lbs| &#x200B; **Workout Split:** **I always lift as heavy as I can. I always seem to do a set of at least 90% of my 1RM everyday just because I get bored, my workouts are never consistent because even though I'm on a pull day, I might end up adding a few push exercises if I'm feeling spicy.** **I ALWAYS SUPER/DROP SET ACCESSORIES.** Edit: I only started doing cardio 2-3 weeks ago, 15-20 minutes on stair master at lvl 8-10 or 30-40 minute 10% incline walks on treadmill. I get winded quick and my ankles hurt as well.  For the past 4 months or so I've worked out every single day for around (2.5 hours - 3 hours), with only taking approx. 7 rest days. The program that I've been running for the past three months is Push, Pull, Legs - prior to this I did one month of Dramatic Transformation Program (DTP), and prior to this I just did full body workouts for around an hour a day. I am in no means experienced at all and often I find myself questioning what I'm doing. Below are **examples of my PPL workouts:** &#x200B; **Push:** |Flat Barbell Bench: Warm-up sets followed by 3-5 sets of 1-6 reps (depending on weight)|Dips: 3 sets until failure| |:-|:-| |Incline Dumbbell Bench: Same structure as flat barbell bench|Cable Flies: I do 3 sets of each (total of 9 sets) from the top, the middle, then the bottom. 12+ reps no less.| |Decline Barbell Bench: 3 sets of 6 reps @ whatever the heaviest weigh I can still manage 6 proper reps for.|Push ups: 100 reps, no weight| |Standing Barbell OHP: Same structure as flat barbell bench|Sitting Dumbbell OHP: 3x8 reps| |Tricep pushdown: 5 sets of pyramid e.g: 25 reps @ 20lbs, 20 reps @ 25lbs, 15 reps @ 30lbs, 10 reps @35lbs, 6 reps @ 40lbs.|Skull crushers: 3x8| |Cable rope overhead: Same as tricep pushdown|Single hand tricep pushdown: Same structure as tricep pushdown.| &#x200B; **Pull:** &#x200B; |Conventional Deadlift: Warm-up sets followed by 3-5 sets of 1-6 reps (depending on weight)|Pull ups: 5 sets until failure| |:-|:-| |Sumo Deadlift: 2x5|Lat Pulldown: 5 sets of pyramid| |Barbell Rows: Same structure as conventional|Sitting Machine Row?: 5 sets of pyramid| |Bicep Curl: 5 sets of pyramid|Single hand machine row: 5x12| |Hammer Curls: 5x14,12,10,8,6 (pyramid)|Rope Facepulls: 5x,20,18,16,14,12 (pyramid)| &#x200B; **Legs:** &#x200B; |Squats: Warm-up followed by 6 working sets (same as bench & DL)|Laying Leg Press: 5x20,18,16,14,12 (pyramid)| |:-|:-| |Front Squat: 3x5,3,1|Adductor machine (the thing IG models use): 5x12| |Barbell Hack Squats: Warm-up followed by 6 working sets|Abductor machine: 5x12| |Calf Raises: 5x12|Machine kickbacks: 5x12| |Leg Pressdown Machine: 3x12|Hamstring Pressdown Machine: 3x12| &#x200B; These are typical of my workouts, if I finish all of these in less than two hours I will just find other exercises and do those until the third hour. &#x200B; **DIET:** In November and December I ate at maintenance calories (approx. 2500) or at a surplus (holidays season). Starting January I began intermittent fasting (16 hour fast, 8 hour eating window) and was eating at a 200-300 caloric deficit (2200 or 2300 calories a day). Beginning of February I stopped bull shitting and started tracking macros and aimed for 1600 calories a day, for the month of February and March I probably ate at around 1200-1600 calories. April was my finals season so I did not have a proper diet, was not intermittent fasting, and ate at around 1800-2000 calories a day. Right now I am trying to eat at a caloric deficit of 1800, but having a hard time because I've been feeling a lot hungrier lately (have not been intermittent fasting )= **\*\* I made sure to always reach 0.8g/lb of bodyweight in protein. Starting April, I have been trying to do 1:1g/lb of bodyweight in protein. As long as I reached my protein amount, I filled the rest of the calories with whatever carbs or fats I had for the day \*\*** &#x200B; I ate any meat as long as it gave me the protein I needed, it may be pork, lamb, beef, chicken, fish, etc. I dislike vegetables, I barely eat them, probably a bad thing... &#x200B; **Meal Examples:** Breakfast: Oats, protein powder, and 1/2 cup of whole milk.

bow9rq,"**Background:** My son was born in December of 2017. I quit smoking, gained roughly 30 pounds, and went from being overweight to obese. After several months, I decided that I didn't want to be incapable of keeping up with my child, and began my transformation. This is my 11 month progress report, which I've been hesitant to give because it exposes me as a rank novice, but I believe in honesty and feedback. &#x200B; **Progress Picture:**  [https://imgur.com/a/bqQP7D7](https://imgur.com/a/bqQP7D7?fbclid=IwAR1iA_RhScb-eOHfjNKhMLb2VkcYh_hE_B3vZQ_0lW-oVOU_f3iPNNYCBrk)  **Edit**: Additional recent photos - [https://imgur.com/a/WMQHmOc](https://imgur.com/a/WMQHmOc)  **Stats:** 5'8"", Male, SW 226LB, CW 172LB **Lift Progress:** I'm going to note 3 numbers here. The first is my starting lifts in my apartment complex gym which was limited to dumbbells, the second is my first barbell lift in August of 2018, and the third is current. All lifts are tested, not estimated. **Bench:** 25LB (x2) > 125LB > 215LB **Squat:** 50LB (Goblet) > 165LB > 300LB **Deadlift:** N/A > 175 LB > 385LB **OHP:** 15LB (x2) > 85 LB > 130LB **Diet:** I rapidly cut weight over the first \~3 months of the transformation period. I ate on average 1800 calories a day and my only ""rules"" were to get at least 120g of protein and 50g of fat every day. Following the cut portion, I bulked from August through March, with my protein goal increased to 170g of protein and my calorie goal averaging around 3500 calories a day due to rampant two-a-days and a decent bit of conditioning and cardio work. **Routine:** **May 2018-August 2018:** During this period of time I used an apartment complex gym and lifted every other day. The only thing that changed about my workout at this time was the order in which I did the movements. I was rapidly losing weight in this period, but still managed progress. I would note that I look back and find this very inefficient. I was limited to dumbbells, a rough cable machine, and a few machines. A: DB Bench Press 3x6 DB Overhead Press 3x6 DB One-Arm Row 3x10 Pull-Up/Chin-Up 3x8 (Supplementing Negatives) Goblet Squat 3x10 Leg Curls 3x10 Hammer Curl 4x12 Overhead Tricep Extension 4x12 Lat Raise 3x15 &#x200B; **August 2018-November 2018:** At this point I joined my local Retro Fitness and began barbell lifts. I ran [the wiki PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) with only a few substitutions: * I deadlifted in a 3x5+ rep scheme twice a week instead of once * I did one-arm rows instead of cable rows on some days * I often supplemented with additional back work in a two-a-day session &#x200B; **November 2018-December 2018:** I briefly ran [PHUL](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout) in this period but didn't make a large amount of progress due to a pretty packed family travel schedule. It turns out everyone loves seeing a small redheaded one-year old around his birthday, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. **January 2019-Current:** I am running the nSuns 6-day Squat Variant with zero substitutions. I do back work on every single day. Here's my accessory work: Upper Days: Pull-Ups 3x8 -or- Weighted Chin-Ups 3x5 Lat Pulldown 4x10 Alternating Cross-Body Hammer Curls 3x10 Cable Overhead Tricep Extension 3x10 Cable Lat Raises 3x12 Face Pulls 3x15 Lower Days: T-Bar Rows 3x10 Cable Rows 3x10 -or- One-Armed Rows 3x10 Calf Raises in Leg Press 3x15 Waiter Carries (for distance) **Cardio/Conditioning:** In addition to the workouts above, I am currently running an average of 20-30 mpw and have participated in a couple of 5k races, setting better PRs than when I was a 130LB high school cross country runner. I also will add conditioning work 3-4x a week including heavy farmers carries, sandbag carries, weighted vest walks, overhead carries, and various bodyweight circuits. **Next Steps:** Currently bulking. I have another couple races in the next month and I am going to continue running nSuns until I milk every last bit of noobie progress out, at which point I am eyeing 5/3/1 BBB or another mass-focused variant.","So if I read this correctly you have a 1,5 year old kid, a job and manage to lift six times a week + running multiple times per week? That is really impressive, how do you manage a life like that? &#x200B; Great work on the progress! It's really all about altering that mindset/lifestyle, you'll be a great example for your kid and the photos will make for a great (inspirational) story! :)",628

bze0g8,"[Before and After Picture (438 lbs to 260 lbs)](https://imgur.com/gallery/KnSMQOW)  Since a young boy, I have always struggled with being overweight and have had countless failed attempts trying to lose it. On April 3rd of last year, I decided to finally commit and really push myself to the limit and beyond both physically and mentally. I knew this time was different; my mindset and determination to succeed were stronger than ever before. Over this past year, I have learned so much, about weight loss, exercise, dieting, and myself as a person. With the use of IF/OMAD (Intermittent Fasting/One Meal A Day), keeping CICO in mind, and a consistent workout routine, I have been able to lose 180+ pounds thus far.  Height: 6’2 Age: 20 years old Weight Difference in Before and After Picture: 438 lbs to 260 lbs (178 lbs lost)  Exercise: I have been doing a bodybuilding routine in order to try to maintain and build as much muscle as possible while I am simultaneously losing all the weight I am. So doing a muscle building workout routine has definitely been key for me to help with my physique and not have me looking flat with all the weight I am losing.  Also, I workout (both lifting and cardio) in a fasted state, mainly to help burn fat and build muscle more efficiently.  Since I started working out in April of last year, I have tried out a variety of routines (Bro Split, 4-Day UL, 6-Day UL, 6-Day PPL, 5-Day ULPPL) and have had success with all of them but find the best and most efficient for my current schedule to be the 5-Day Upper, Lower, Push, Pull, Legs routine. I do this routine while incorporating cardio (usually HIIT) right after I am done lifting on at least 3 of those days typically. I also try to stay active on any rest days and get cardio in through sports like basketball, soccer, boxing, or going for a jog whenever I can. Here is the current routine I am following: Day 1 (Upper Day): Bench Press - 4 sets - 5-8 reps Barbell Row - 4 sets - 5-8 reps DB Overhead Press - 3 sets - 5-8 reps Wide-grip Pulldowns or Pull-ups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps DB curls - 4 sets - 8-12 reps Straight-arm Pulldowns/Face-pulls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps Day 2 (Lower Day): Back Squat - 4 sets - 5-8 reps Deadlift - 3 sets - 5-8 reps Hack Squat - 3 sets - 5-8 reps Lying Leg Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps Single-leg Leg Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps Standing Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps Core Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps Day 3: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, go for a jog, etc.) Day 4 (Pull Day): Barbell Row - 4 sets - 6-10 reps Wide-grip Pulldowns or Pullups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps T-bar, Cable or DB Rows - 3 sets - 6-10 reps Close-grip Pulldowns - 3 sets - 8-12 reps Straight-arm Pulldowns/Facepulls - 3 supersets - 10-15 reps each Barbell Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps Hammer Curls, Cable or DB - 3 sets - 8-12 reps Day 5 (Push Day): DB Bench Press - 4 sets - 6-10 reps Overhead Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps Incline DB Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps Cable Crossovers (standing or seated) - 3 sets - 8-12 reps Lateral Raises - 3 sets - 8-12 reps Close-grip Bench Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps Tricep Extensions - 3 sets - 8-12 reps Day 6 (Leg Day): Back Squat - 4 sets - 6-10 reps Deadlift - 3 sets - 6-10 reps Leg Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps Leg Extensions/Leg Curls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps Seated Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps Core Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps Day 7: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, Go for a jog, etc.)  Diet: I believe that finding a long-term sustainable diet really is essential not only for losing weight, but ensuring you keep the weight off! Finding the right plan is a person to person basis so I did a lot of experimenting with different dieting techniques (IF, OMAD, Keto, Atkins etc.) until I was able to find one that I was pleased by and could see myself doing long-term. Currently, I am doing OMAD/IF on a High Protein, Low Carb diet. Macros:  Currently I try to keep it roughly 40-45% protein, 30-35% fats, and 20% carbs. I am not very strict on these percentages but aim to keep within these ranges as much as possible. Day of eating: Most days I am doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and I have this meal usually right after I workout (workout is done fasted). A regular day of eating this one meal would be a post-workout protein shake/bar, Chicken usually as my main meat source of protein, or turkey, beef etc. when I can. A salad and veggies as well as often as I can to ensure I get my greens in and a good source of fibre! Then for desert or if I need to get more fibre in I will have a fibre bar, kale chips, granola bar, or protein ice cream, which are all high sources of fibre and taste great! If I am not doing OMAD, I will be doing Intermittent Fasting on usually a 2-4 hour window to eat, where I will have the aforementioned foods except more split up. I am not really a picky eater so this is what my diet mostly consists of. Supplements: -Ashwaganda (Pill form, one 650mg pill before workout when I need an extra energy boost) -Kaizen Whey Isolate Protein (2 scoops @ 35g/scoop post-workout usually) -ENGN Shred Pre-workout (1 scoop 15-30 minutes before workout)   Conclusion: I have really grown mentally and although my weight loss journey isn’t done yet (roughly 30-50 pounds to lose) I am proud of what I have accomplished thus far. Through this weight loss, not only have I been able to get myself to live a way healthier lifestyle and improve my mental and physical health, but I have also found a true purpose and calling for once in my life. I plan to make as big of a positive impact as possible and help/inspire as many people as I can. This is just the beginning and I’m genuinely excited for what I have planned in the future! Thanks for reading, I have love for every single one of you and wish you all the most success on your journeys! :)  EDIT: Just got back from the gym to see all the support you guys left me... and wow... I truly feel so grateful and blessed. To see all the love and support from people I don’t even know, some who are genuinely happy and proud of me... it’s something I will never take for granted. What makes me even more happy and content is how many people who are struggling with the same issues I am/was and were positively impacted by this or got that extra push they needed to keep going... to keep pushing despite all the hardships they may encounter. I just feel so blessed to have this opportunity and seriously have love for all of you. Honestly, it feels amazing to not only be recognized for all the hard work, and literal blood, sweat, and tears that led me to this point, but also be able to inspire and motivate others to work towards a better and healthier version of themselves. I promise this is only the beginning, and I will do the best I can to lead by example and make as much of a positive impact as I possibly can. And for those who were inspired/motivated by my journey and are currently facing adversity, you have to do it yourself, you must realize your potential, that potential which we all possess inside of us, and become the best version of yourself you can be. I know it’s hard and might seem impossible at times, but trust me, it is very much possible, and very much worth it. Once again, thank you all for all of the support, I genuinely appreciate all of the love. Stay blessed, and best of luck on your journeys. ❤️",This is incredible!!! Congratulations on your amazing journey and all that’s to come!! Keep up the great work!!,599
c0ga1d,"**Male** **Weight: 185-190** **Height: 5'9"" (did not change)** **Age: 19-20** Album: https://imgur.com/a/yFjpjz9 Hey everyone,  I've been thinking about posting this for a while and finally decided to pull the trigger. Maybe it'll inspire some of y'all to keep pushing and that's why I love this activity - there are so many people to look up to from the idols of fitness to that super jacked guy in your local gym. And seeing that someone who used to be out of shape was able to get there...maybe will help someone out.  So this is a bit late, it was actually two years ago, but it was my most drastic year of change (between June 2016 to July 2017). As I said, I actually gained 5 pounds of weight in between, which just goes to show that weight is not a good measure of fitness at all, especially if you're interested in muscle growth.  So what changed?  **1) Diet.** I did not have any really hard dieting restrictions. Nothing like ""no ice cream"" or ""no cheese"". All I did was download MyFitnessPal and log my meals - mostly approximating. Because I was in college at the time and my college did not publish nutrition information, I'd guess. So if I had some rice, I'd guess it was about a cup, and just use the database to find an approximation. If I didn't have exact info, I'd err on over-estimating calories.  As I said, I did not have any set rules, I just tried to be more mindful about food, and it was surprisingly easy. Going to Panda Express? Ditch the orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp with fried rice. Get teriyaki chicken/broccoli beef with half steamed veggies half brown rice - also pretty good, like 1000 fewer calories. The biggest thing is you just become aware - eating a cookie now means no ice cream at dinner. Eventually it becomes normal instead of a chore, and some days you even have extra calories and CAN treat yourself to a milkshake.  I aimed for a ~1000 calorie deficit per day for the first 5 months. After that I just tried to maintain my weight (no deficit/surplus) cause I wanted to get stronger, not just leaner. I would not count protein shakes in my calorie count (2 scoops ON + milk, occasionally a banana or some peanut butter), but I also wouldn't log the calories burned from lifting. I did however log calories burned from my cardio. So as a 5'9"" 185 pound guy who walked a fair bit (college), my ""maintenance"" calories were ~3000, so I shot for ~2000 per day. In term of macros, I just tried to supplement my diet with 2.5 scoops of protein powder per day - so really about 1-1.5g protein/kg bodyweight.  **2) Exercise.** When the before picture was taken, I would go to the gym infrequently. I had lifted on/off for about 2 years. 3-4 times a week on good weeks, but more like 1-2 times normally. I want to stress: this is not a ""beginning"" photo as in I had JUST started working out/never weightlifted before. I had been working out and lifting for about 2 years, but I had never been really dedicated, did not truly push myself in the gym, and had no real set routine. So I had muscle - I was not a true beginner - but there was a LOT of room for improvement and more dedication.  I was decently strong on upper body lifts, just ignored my lower body. Huge mistake, don't do that. I'm still making up for that imbalance now. I had tried a lot of times to lose weight. In high school I did cross country, lost a ton of weight, gained it all back after the season ended. Then I started lifting weights, started seeing a change, and college kicked my butt and I was back to square 1. Finally, I got sick of yo-yo-ing back and forth. I decided I'd either be committed or quit...and I hated the idea of quitting. So I told myself: I will drag myself to the gym EVERY day unless I am puking. Even if it's just for a mile run on the treadmill or 10 pull-ups, I will be at the gym. And I found that once I was there, it would often translate into a workout - even when I was tired.  Oh, I also started tracking lifts and making set routines. That's huge guys. You really can't improve much without being consistent and knowing where you are - and a 1RM is just as important as how many reps you did of set 3 of your 3rd iso exercise. Push yourself always, and always aim to be better than you were yesterday. Even on your 15th set. So you should know what you're lifting, for how many reps, every set.  So what did I do?  **Starting:** * I benched ~225x2 * OHP was 50 pound dumbbells * Preacher curl was 65x8 * I could do 12 pull-ups straight * I did not do many deadlifts or squats, but when I tried my numbers for both of those were around 225. As I said - I totally just skipped lower body.  **Ending:** * Benched 275x6, 1RM 315 *  OHP was 85 pound dumbbells * Preacher curl was 95x12 * I could do 25 pull-ups and FINALLY did a muscle-up (woo!). I also worked on weighted pullups and could do 12 with 45 pounds attached.  * My deadlift was 365 but my squat still lagged behind at 295 (I'd like to blame hip issues, which I did face, but it was more laziness than anything).  My new routine was a 4-day split (but I'd not really take any rest days, I just would start the cycle again as soon as I finished). Chest/Back/Shoulders/Legs, abs on chest and shoulder day. I also played basketball a fair bit (I'm still trash though) and would run here or there (like twice a week, maybe a mile...nothing serious) **I've written up my program before, and I find that spreadsheets can be helpful - so here it is for all of you to use!** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K2E7U9nFyPh4qm_iU0krZbtQH2LAOKN4?usp=sharing Why did I choose these workouts? I wanted to get better at one ""big"" compound per session (bench/deadlift/overhead dumbbell press (weird one I know but I like it)/squat). So that would be my first objective. I worked on a reverse pyramid with that heavy weight so I could attune my body towards moving heavier weight, but as I decreased weight and increased reps, would also be able to develop a bit of endurance, really stressing out and completely exhausting the primary movers of any given movement. After that, I'd like to do variations of that heavy movement, like incline/decline bench (for bench press) or leg press (for squats) or rows (for deadlifts). I found that these variations helped me build around that main muscle and allowed me to work smaller muscle groups well. Finally, I'd do isos - like tricep dips on bench day or lat pulldowns (not really an iso, but it's not as full-body as a deadlift) on back day. I wanted to target a specific area, and I would change around my isos based on how strong I was. So for example, if I struggled with the top part of my bench I did more tricep work - extensions, dips, etc. If I struggled with the bottom, I did more flyes. So it was a ""powerbuilding"" routine - focusing on getting good at 4 lifts, but also working all the small, auxiliary movers the best I could.  **Abs was pretty simple.**  2x the following circuit:  * 15x single-leg v-ups, switch after finishing one side * 25x crunch * 25x russian twist * 25x bicycle followed by:  1x the following circuit:  * 15x lying-down reverse crunches * 15x power tower leg raises * 5x hanging oblique raises * 15x ab wheel * 1 minute plank The rep ranges are guidelines. In reality, I was doing AMRAPs on almost everything as long as it was safe. So when I say 4-6, what I mean is 4-6 reps will REALLY challenge you, not an easy 4-6. So on a good day you'll hit 6 MAYBE 7, on a bad day you might struggle to get 4 - always push yourself and increase weight when you move out of the rep range.  Try not to take too much rest. 2 minutes between heavy compounds is good. 90 seconds between isos is plenty (for this transformation, obviously different goals -> different rest) Finally: what changed?  I fell in love with fitness. It became a hobby - something I felt the day was incomplete without. I stopped making excuses. I made time for lifting by not watching 3 hours of youtube and the office per day.  Why do you do it? Do you do it for love or for hate? Because you hate what you look like and want to punish yourself for eating poorly? That is a mindset filled with self-defeatism and punishment.  Nah. You gotta do it cause you love it. Because you love that fitness is showing yourself how badass you can be. That if you work hard, you CAN bench 2 plates, then one day you'll be repping that. It's not a punishment. It's a celebration of what you can do.  Go get it. Happy to answer questions and help anyone getting into this.  Oh and finally, my numbers now:  * Bench: 335x2, never tried to max out, or 315x5, or 225x19 * OHP: 100 pound dumbbells x 12 * Preacher curl: 95x14, I don't do these too much * Dumbbell row: 150 (each side) x 9 * Pullups: max ever was 30 * Deadlift: 455 * Squat: 365 * Happiness: 100",How to become a fitness model in 13 months.

c2byih,"He was trying to be supportive but the execution was off. Now I'm even more motivated to finish the program and prove him wrong!  Any females try this program?  How were your results? Edit: my husband is a good guy, he's human and makes mistakes like the rest of us,  be nice, y'all.","You should join /r/xxfitness and read the FAQs/wiki there. I feel like I've been spamming this lately, but there's a ton of misinformation and disinformation when it comes to women's fitness. It's mind boggling. You will not bulk up unless you work very hard for years and jump on roids.   EDIT: I wanted to clarify a few things. One person might call a muscular woman fit and athletic, while another might call her bulky and masculine. It all depends on the person. I think you need to decide what look you want to go for, and make modifications as you go if you're not pleased with the results. That means decreasing volume/intensity/frequency, removing certain movements/exercises, eating less, etc.  With that in mind, I find that women that want to be very muscular but want to avoid looking masculine in any way avoid or minimize training traps (neck is an important contributor to looking masculine as well). For some reason, when traps are very well developed on a lady, in my opinion, they can look masculine (especially upper traps). In which case, like another poster said, if deadlifts (they train traps along with the lower body and lower back) are not working for you aesthetically, then replace them with heavy leg work (glute bridges, hip thrusts, squats, leg curls, etc) and back extensions. Almost every movement can be replaced. It's not by force to do a movement.",1876
c4pdo4,"On The Rock’s IG, he posted his weekly cheat meal train. This week was two bacon cheeseburgers with a mound of fries, a double shot of tequila, and what looked like a brownie, a blondie, seven cookies, and a large slice of cheesecake. He says this will help him in his photo shoot the next morning. Is that true? If so, what’s the science behind that? I would imagine the bloating might help with looking bigger but not for a muscular physique that I’m sure he’s going for in the shoot.","Body builders do this before meets too.  When you cut for a long period of time your muscle glycogen depletes.  Eating a bunch of carbs refills your muscles with glycogen. But people will handle it differently.  The rock looks good the day after he does this, other people look like shit a day after and then in 4 days look great.  Its all about trying it yourself and seeing how it goes. But if you haven't been cutting and your glycogen muscle stores aren't depleted its not going to do anything. Edited out my phone stupid ""hobbits"" autocorrect.",2831
c59dq1,"I (28F) have been avoiding the gym for a few days now because I have come down with a nasty heat rash (it’s quite crazy hot here in Berlin right now, at least by German standards) and I don’t want to make it worse with all the sweating during workouts. I have also not been doing any exercises at home because my house is also really hot right now (no fans and/or air conditioning, and the ventilation is really minimum) and it’s extremely uncomfortable to just be inside, let alone workout. However, I have an important trip coming up where I will be away at a conference for a few days and then travel a bit around the UK. I’ll be gone for around 11 days, and since I’ll be moving from place to place and staying in hostels, I don’t think I’ll have an opportunity to exercise.  Now here’s the thing: I can’t help feeling guilty about missing so many workouts. I know that logically it’s not like I’m going to regain all my lost weight after 2 weeks of not going to the gym (I do intend to walk a lot during the vacation as some kind of compensation), but I still can’t shake off the feeling that I’m derailing all my progress.  Does this happen to anybody else? If yes, then how do you cope? I guess I’m just looking for some helpful advice here. Apologies if the tenor of this post is unlike others — I will be happy to redirect this to a more appropriate sub should you so recommend.  tl;dr Have been missing workouts for a variety of reasons and will be away on vacation soon, looking for advice on how to avoid feeling like I’m derailing all my progress Edit 1: So this post blew up WAAAYY more than I had expected or anticipated. Already wrote this in the comments, but am pretty sure it got lost amidst the happy deluge of other comments, so here goes — thank you so very much to everyone who took the time out to comment (even if it was to disagree)! I have read every single comment, and it’s heartening to find that not only have many people confronted similar feelings, but also that this fear is largely a baseless one because rest preps the body for better gains and does not really reset progress. I suppose I was feeling guilty because previously whenever I had taken extended periods of breaks, they were all because of illness, whereas this time my mind is telling me that a rash isn’t really an *illness* and that by not going I’m just being lazy. As many people rightly diagnosed, it’s also the fear of not being able to get back on the bandwagon AFTER the vacation. But I have decided on two things: I’ll get a workout session in tomorrow before I leave for vacation because it’s supposed to be much cooler tomorrow and because my rash has almost completely healed. I also have a pretty packed schedule during my vacation and will probably not be able to find the time for a gym, but since I’m a huge nerd, I’ll mostly be visiting English cathedrals and will be climbing up the towers to all of them, so that should be a good cardio workout at any rate! :D Edit 2: To the person who messaged me asking “what the fuck is a heat rash” and claiming that I was using it as a bullshit excuse, I really, really hope you don’t ever get one in your life. As one of the commenters said, it honestly feels like you accidentally rolled on poison ivy. Angry red, inflamed, itchy hives all over your body. I even got a rash ON MY SCALP (apologies for TMI), which actually gave me throbbing headaches. I’m from India, and anyone from a tropical country knows that prickly heat is a super common occurrence during the summers. I just never expected to get it here in northern Europe. In India, you get menthol dusting powders which really help, but I haven’t found any in the drugstores here. Also, to the person who called me a bitch in the comments, thank you for your invaluable input! The comments are much richer for it.  Edit 3: u/Juggernaut78, you a soothsayer, my man. The gym I go to is indeed McFit — no air circulation AT ALL because they somehow refuse to ever switch on the air conditioning. I nearly passed out in the cardio area the other day lol. If the heatwave continues even after my return, I’m going to try hitting the gym around 5 am. Also, a big hello back to all the Berliners! Grüße aus Moabit! :D","I can draw on personal experience that short breaks have zero long term repercussions if they aren't overly frequent. You might not have this experience yet, but hopefully you can listen to others when they say you won't lose anything by taking a fews days or even a week or two off. Seriously not a bid deal.",502
c738e7,"[TLDR NSFW](https://imgur.com/a/xo4kWhv) 2014-2019 M/6’3”/360lbs/20yo -  M/6’3”/235/24yo About me: Growing up I was always a chubby kid, and would weigh from 250-275 throughout highschool and was happy with how I looked for the most part. I played some sports but never was very fit, and would lift here and there but never did it seriously. After highschool I bloated up to 360 over the course of 2 years, and had no idea how bad I had let myself go. I had a pre-employment physical for a job and stepped on the scale for the first time in probably years and was blown away to see that I was that heavy, but I justified it to myself and said I was just always a bigger guy. Thankfully I had a couple friends encourage me to lift with them, and that’s what got me started.  Diet: The first four months, I just worked out and ate my regular shitty diet, but still managed to lose 40lbs. Once I realized that I could actually lose weight if I just put in a little effort, I joined this subreddit and learned what I could, and downloaded myfitnesspal. I started eating whatever I wanted but kept it under 4k cal, and the weight just fell off. Every time my weight would stall I'd drop 500 calories and it would start falling again. Current diet had been 2500-2750kcal, 250-300 protein 75-125 fat and then carbs tend to be 150 but I only really care about my protein. My day usually consists a breakfast of two rice cakes right when I wake up, or a protein bagel. I then go workout and go to work for 12 hours, where I'll have two tuna sandwiches, greek yogurt, apples, bananas, protein bars, and a meal prep which is usually about 1lb chicken, half pound 93/7 turkey, and a bunch of veggies. Supplement wise, I take a few vitamins, as well as creatine and glutamine. Lifting: Just like my diet, when I started I had no clue what I was doing. I ran a 3 day PPL, squatted on the smith machine, just did whatever weight for whatever reps I could do. When I found this sub I started on 5/3/1 which was probably a bad idea since my form was garbage and I was lifting way heavier than I should have. I was about 300lbs when I started 5/3/1, and I ran it for two years ending at 275lbs. My numbers were: Start           Finish Squat 255       420 Bench 285       290 Dead 315        495 OHP 185         190 The three following years I've run a series of programs with some success, trying to find what I liked and what worked for me. I've run, conjugate, back to 5/3/1 variations, Jnt, nsuns 5/3/1, and now I'm currently on my own GZCL program. I have dealt with a few different lower body issues stemming from form issues and weaknesses. Right now I'm focusing on getting my form down, and building a good volume base. My numbers now are more like Squat 315 Bench 330 Dead 365 Ohp 200 Conclusion: As of writing this, I am on my way back home from a cruise where I most definitely ruined my diet, but I worked hard the last few months to lean out.  I definitely needed the break and deserved it. I’m planning on cutting down some more. Thanks to all the loose skin, I’m not entirely sure how to feel about my physique, which is the main purpose of this post. I’m looking for insight, should I cut more? Am I lean? Am I chubby? There are days that I love the way I look and feel like some skinny jacked and tan mother fucker, and other days I feel like I’m still a chubby dad bod looking dude and have no idea what I’m doing. If I had to guess I'm around 20% bodyfat but who can really say.  I’m thinking I’ll cut down to 225ish, see how I look there and start a slow bulk from there and really get my strength back.

c7xu1z,"**Photos:**  [https://imgur.com/a/j7hk3R3](https://imgur.com/a/j7hk3R3) (Third one maybe NSFW?) **Weight:** 265lb ---> 177lb from end sophomore year of high school to end of freshman year of college. **Exercise:** You guys aren't gonna like this, but it was pretty much all cardio. Not a lot of serious lifting. Tons of rowing, a little biking and running. **Diet:** I tried lots of different fad diets or calorie counting, and they worked for a while, but the thing that worked the most for me was to just stop eating unhealthy foods except for on special occasions. I just tried to eat a little less than I thought I needed to eat each day, not counting calories or anything. That's when I really noticed a lifestyle change and good habits starting to form. **Background:** I was always fat as a kid. Never had a good relationship with food. Despite playing some sports in middle school, I was still slowly getting heavier and heavier. When I reached the beginning of sophomore year of high school, I knew something needed to change. I had a few friends on the crew team at my high school, so I figured I might as well join.  **Sophomore Year:** So I was rowing this year but still had no clue what I was doing diet wise. I didn't weigh myself very often and assumed I would start slimming down from the workouts alone, but I was still eating like crap. When we had weigh ins during winter training I hit 265, and it was then that I started browsing r/fitness and started figuring out how nutrition seriously impacted weight loss. I got down to about 245-250 by the end of sophomore year. **Junior Year:** Junior year was not as steady of a decline in weight as it could've been. However, near the end of junior year, something clicked in my brain and my motivation for rowing skyrocketed. That summer, I dropped from 230-210, and was doing about 2-2.5 hours of steady state rowing a day. When I got back to school, I was one of the fastest guys on the team. **Senior Year:** Senior year was going very well. I got a recruitment offer from a smaller D1 rowing school, everything was going great. That is, until I got a pretty bad back injury from the lack of stretching/core that I did (EVERYONE STRETCH AND DO ABS EVERY DAY ITS NOT HARD). I was out for the winter, and I bulked back up to 230. When I was healthy again in the spring, I started right back up and got down to 225 by the end of the season. That summer, I dropped down to below 200 for the first time. **Freshman Year of College:** I'm pretty sure the only thing that kept of the freshman 15 was the large amount of training volume that I was doing. I managed to steadily drop weight over the course of the year down to 175.  **How My Life Changed:** Everything gets better when you lose weight.  * Productivity and overall motivation is at an all time high. Once I finally started getting close to my goal weight, I started working harder and harder to get there, which kind of showed me that I can do anything I want to if I set my mind to it. My grades improved, I developed many good habits * Social life improved a lot. Became a lot more confident and outgoing, therefore I made a lot of new friends. * I was always scared of trying new things because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to do it. After reaching my fitness goals, I realized that I can do anything that I want if I set my mind to it. I started doing a bunch of cool stuff like learning to skateboard, learning how to juggle, yoga, you name it.  **Future Goals:** I still have a little belly fat to lose (or maybe it's just loose skin?) but right now I'm not really focusing on my weight anymore. I'm gonna start lifting, and keep erging/rowing so I can get my times down.  **Advice for Others:** I have one big piece of advice for everyone. There are gonna be days where you don't want to do anything. You don't want to do that workout, don't want to eat chicken and broccoli for lunch again, and you're just telling yourself that you'll get back on track tomorrow. NEVER have a day where you don't do anything to your goals. Even if it's as simple as eating a chicken salad instead of a burger and fries. Make sure that every day, you're doing AT LEAST one things towards your goals. Do your future self a favor. Losing weight and getting fit is easy. All you have to do is want it bad enough. **Closing Thoughts:** You can do whatever you want. Honestly. Whatever you want to do in life, you can do it. It could take 6 months, one year, hell it could take 5 years. All you have to do is get up and do it.","So TL;DR: If you want to lose weight, MOAR STEADY STATE Hi from r/rowing",1423

ccf0ga,"First of all, my [progress pics](https://i.imgur.com/7H2FQw5.png). I'm a 5'7 20 year old student (turning 21 next week) who decided exactly two and a half years ago he'd had enough of constantly going to the gym and only seeing mediocre progress at best. In my before pic, January 2017, I'd been going to the gym for a little over 3 years believe it or not. My gym knowledge consisted pretty much of whatever the other gym bros told me and I just followed a mediocre brosplit (chest/biceps, back/triceps, skip leg day, etc...), eating whatever my mom cooked at home and trying to get some cans of tuna in for some protein. I decided I'd had enough and with me moving out for college, it was the perfect opportunity to get on the right track in my fitness journey. I started reading a LOT about everything fitness related and got on a decent program. I started tracking my macros, hitting at least 1g of protein per lb bodyweight and got on a 'decent' program. If I remember correctly, I started doing 5x5 compound movements and a bunch of isolation work and I quickly progressed a lot. I made a post here in september 2017 (you can find it in my post history if you want to read more about how I trained back then). It was about this time that I realized I was doing good, but I could do much better. Those 9 months I'd been pretty much starving myself, eating 1500-1800 calories daily with around 150g of protein (half a kg of chicken every day lol). I got a lot of good feedback on my post and decided to start eating properly (slow bulk and cut cycles). Nowadays I'm slow bulking on 3200 calories. I usually run a slow bulk for around 6 to 8 months then do a heavy cut (about 1000 calories deficit) for a good 2 months.   I also got on nSuns and pretty much fell in love with the routine; I still run it to this day although slightly modified (I use the rep scheme for my compound movements and then do my own thing for isolation exercises).  Somewhere along the way I filmed myself and realized I was a major egolifter and deloaded pretty heavily (seriously, technique is everything guys). I can now hit the following weights for 1 to 3 reps with pretty good form: - Squat: 355 lbs - Deadlift: 315 lbs - Bench press: 245 lbs - OHP: 185 lbs (seated OHP) For my routine, I run a 6 day PPL making sure to hit every muscle at least twice a week (usually go heavy one day and higher reps the other day). If you care for it, this is my current routine: Push - Bench press - nsuns - Incline dumbbell press 5x8-12 - Pushups 4xAMRAP - Dumbbell shoulder press 5x12-15 - Decline machine press 5x15 - Machine flies 5x15 - Weighted dips 3x8 - Rope tricep pulldown 5x12 - Single handed tricep pulldown 3xAMRAP  Legs  - Squats - nsuns - Dumbbell sumo squat 5xAMRAP - Leg extensions 4x25 (5 second holds on every 5th rep) - Leg curls 5x25 - Seated calf raise 4x15 - Standing calf raise 3x25+  Pull - Barbell row 5x8 - Weighted pullups 5x8 - Cable row 5x15 - Lat pulldown 5x20 - Back extensions 5x15 - Preacher curl 5x12-15 - Hammer curl 4x12 - EZ bar 21's 3 sets - Reverse grip EZ bar curl 4x12 - Dumbbell holds 3 as long as possible  Push - OHP - nsuns - Bench press - 15, 12, 8, 5, 8, 8, 12, AMRAP - Lateral raise 5x12 - Front raise 4x12 - Dumbbell shrugs 5x15 - Close grip bench 5x8-12 - Rope tricep pulldown 5x12-15 Legs - Squats - 12, 8, 5, 8, 8, 12, AMRAP - Hip thrusts 3x12 2x8 - Leg press 3x12 2x8 - Unilateral leg extension 3x20 55lbs - Leg curls 5x12 - Standing calf raise 5x25 Pull - Deadlift -nsuns - Pullups - 5xAMRAP - Cable row - 5x8-12 - Lat pulldown 5x12-15 - Machine row 5x12 - Dumbbell curl 5x8-12 - EZ bar curl 5x12 - Machine curl 5x12 - Dumbbell forearm curls 3x25 - Dumbbell reverse forearm curls 3x25 As far as supplements go I take 5g of creatine monohydrate every single day and eat plenty of whey protein (although not necessary, I just use it as a tool to hit my macros). Occasionally take caffeine pills as a preworkout. No, I do not and have never taken any PEDs and I do not care if you don't believe me (I weigh less than 70 kgs, seriously?) I learned there's no magic recipe or shortcut for fitness. It's all about consistenly hitting your calories/protein goal and progressing your weights with correct form. For the last 2.5 years I've been in the gym an average of 2 hours a day, 6 days a week lifting heavy weights. I hardly do any cardio at all (I hate cardio lmao) as I prefer to just lower my calorie intake if needed. I use intermittent fasting as a tool to manage my hunger (this is absolutely not needed and just my personal preference). I do NOT eat perfectly everyday. In fact I'm a pretty huge stoner and occasionally eat 5000-6000+ calories every other week or so but I do try to eat less the following days in order to average it out and eat a decent amount of calories weekly. As for my future goals I think I'd like to compete in bodybuilding some time next year and just keep getting stronger, bigger, and leaner. I think I covered everything I could think of but if I missed anything feel free to ask down below and I'll try to answer any questions!",That’s a good number of abs,887
cdvug3,"Edit: if it isn't clear from the source at the top and the tag at the bottom *I did not write this*, I just thought it was powerful and worth sharing [Wise words from Purple Spengler:](https://purplespengler.blogspot.com/?m=1) ""There was a time in my life when I was the biggest World of Warcraft nerd that you can imagine. It was around the middle of the second expansion that I got exposed to the concept of ""theorycrafting"" or ""min/maxing"" and it revolutionized how I played not just that game, but all games. Instead of simply playing the game, I also played a meta-game of spreadsheets, equations, simulators, math, numbers, and I was able to achieve character power and success I never had before. I lay this groundwork so that what I am about to say can land more strongly - because I am a nerd, and not just a dummy meathead or whatever who is shouting and drooling. Nerds ruin everything. It's been a long time since my WoW min/maxing obsession days but I still remember how to think that way. And it's because I do that when I read questions like this: What's better for functional strength - powerlifting, bodybuilding, or strongman? Should I do 5/3/1 or GZCL? How can I optimize my PPL routine? When do you become an intermediate? All I see is this: Should I play a Warlock or a Mage or a Shadow Priest? Should I be Arms or Fury? What's the Best in Slot gear at Tier 9 for my Ret Paladin? (fuckin' rerolling, that's what) Is my gearscore high enough to do Heroic ICC? To put it in the vernacular: Hi, my name is John, and I hate every single one of you.  If you're not familiar with the term ""min/maxing"", it's shorthand for ""minimizing weaknesses / maximizing strengths"". The concept is to build the most powerful possible character with what you've got, often also determining the best things to get. In practice, what this boils down to is little more than doing a bunch of math, which works out pretty well because that's what many games, especially RPGs, are based on. And for the most part this strategy is incredibly successful, across many different games. There are parts of it that can even be applied to aspects of real life with success. So people get into a habit of thinking this way. And then they get into lifting, and try to think the same way.  But there's a problem - Lifting is not a fucking video game. And you people need to stop, because you are driving the rest of us insane. Min/Maxing is touted as being a strategy for making strong characters. But in my opinion, what it's really about is removing as much effort from gameplay as possible. This does not just apply to the dudes who make twinks (not that kind) to steamroll the game. Even for people who try to build the most powerful characters so that they can tackle the hardest possible content are still, ultimately, trying to reduce their effort level. Fundamentally, min/maxing is about trying to front-load effort through thinking, doing math, planning, and acquiring the right gear, to reduce the impact that their gameplay can have on their success. It is about determining the perfect way to create a character that can be as successful as possible, as quickly as possible, just by virtue of knowing all the pieces, where they come from, and exactly how you will acquire them and in what order, in advance, before you even truly do anything in the game itself.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  This is reason number one that lifting cannot be treated like a video game. The 80/20 rule is out in force, and for my money one of the top three of what gets you the 80% (it's really more like 90, IMO), alongside consistency and time, is effort. Min/maxing is about transmuting future effort in execution into present effort in planning, so that by the latter you have reduced how much is required in the former. But this is backwards and wrong. Success in lifting is heavily tied to effort in execution, and only tenuously at best to effort in planning. Focusing on having a ""perfect"" training and diet plan while leaving the execution of that plan as a given is flawed at best and self-sabotage at worst. I've said this so many different ways that I feel like a broken record, but I truly believe it needs to be hammered on again and again - effort trumps intelligence. The time to focus on your effort and execution is not after you have created a great plan and it fails, as you would when min/maxing, it is from Day 1.  It sounds stupid to have to say that video games are nothing like real life, but apparently on some level people don't understand this, and it is reason number two to please for everyone's sanity stop treating lifting like an MMO. The entire practice of min/maxing hinges completely and 100% on all inner workings of the game being both completely knowable and infinitely replicable. If DickSocks69 puts the same gear on his character as WarlockMasterXXX, the math and equations that determine their characters' potential damage will always be exactly the same. And both of them can always know exactly what those equations are, how any of the potential random factors average out on a certain timescale, and even what the most optimal rotation or priority list of spellcasting is. But human beings are not RPG characters that are built on math equations. You cannot take Jim and Bill and put them on identical training and dietary plans and have their results be exactly the same. Ever. There is simply too much variance at every possible level and too many factors that are unknowable. This should be obvious, but every single day people behave as though they don't understand that they are not an Orc Warlock.  Finally, there is an inherent attitude of min/maxing that is incompatible with the pursuit of lifting. As always, the context of this is having actual goals. The attitude I mean has many facets and can be described in a many ways, but one I feel that captures a lot of them is ""When can I stop?"" Part of the strategy of min/maxing is about minimizing the grind from character creation to the highest levels, and acquiring the best gear as rapidly as possible, because it is not until this point that ""the real game actually starts"". Min/maxing treats the process of a character growing as a waste of your time, a barrier that must be torn down. If you think of leveling up or iteratively improving the power of your gear as a parallel for training, it becomes about trying to skip as much training as possible.   But this, again, is completely backwards, and ties back in to the first point about effort avoidance. Skipping training is wrong - You want to train more, not less. In a game, you can come up with character builds that manipulate numbers and allow you to walk into a level, lay waste to it, and rapidly advance through the game. But there is no such thing as a secret training and diet plan that is so well planned out, so firmly based in science, that it removes so much effort while giving you such rapid results - because effort and time are primary drivers in results. You can't, through the magic of perfect exercise and food selection, skip the years of consistency and effort it takes most people to achieve their true goals, in the way you can blast from Level 1 to 90 by dumping a bunch of +Experience Gain gear onto your character.  I see this way of thinking fuck with people constantly. Everyone I've ever tried to help with any fitness goal who was a nerd first, they have this exact same problem. And I say all this because I have been there too, and for me, it was only because I figured out how to break myself that I ever got down to the brass tacks of actually busting my balls in training and accomplished anything real. The challenge is not simply to understand that this way of thinking is not compatible with every pursuit, and why, but it is more importantly about learning how to find the switch in your head so you can turn it off sometimes. I don't have any advice to offer there other than to say that I know there's a switch because I found it. But I've only got a map for my own head."" - /u/purplespengler","This post comes just as I was trying to figure out the optimal allocation of triceps exercises over my 4 lifting days and how dips factor into, literally sitting over a spreadsheet shuffling exercises around and referencing as much external information as possible.

cejav9,"**Tl;dr:** This sub helped me A LOT by improving my overall knowledge and I would recommend anyone that is just starting to read the Wiki as you will learn many things! # Short Introduction It's been actually 7 months now since I've been going to the gym, 6 of which I've been counting my calories and having a proper diet. During this period, I only skipped gym twice and those were only leg days. In the first 3 and a half months I followed the Ice Cream Fitness (ICF) routine, which I think is the best thing for a beginner to follow. During the first month I just learned the proper technique for all the compound movements as I started with an empty bar in almost all of them and I didn't count my calories. From the beginning of 2019 I started counting my calories and cutting the fat while increasing my newbie strength, although, as many of you will say that I should have just started bulking I wanted to see some improvement first, and also to begin the bulking phase with a lower body fat percentage. After finishing with ICF and the cutting phase I started bulking and I changed my routine to Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower (PHUL) which I followed until this week when I switched to Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training (PHAT). Every phase of my transformation will be broadly detailed further. # Pics & stats ([Progress Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/JOj3lJ3)) *Sex*: Male *Age*: 23 years old (22 when I started) *Height*: 180 cm/ 5'11'' *Weight*: (As I weighted myself daily, I'll write the weekly average in order to prevent any confusion) Before I started cutting: 26/12/2018-01/01/2019 - average is 72.63 kg / 160.1 lbs Once I finished cutting: 18/03/2019-24/03/2019 - average is 68.03 kg / 149.9 lbs Where I am now 08/07/2019-14/07/2019 - average is 73,12 kg / 161,2 lbs  # Background Right now I am doing a Master's Degree in Cyber Security Engineering and before I never played any sport in particular, I only used to play football, but that was in high school, 4 years ago. So, I was basically a couch potato, not including that I played World of Warcraft also :)). Basically, before I started going to the gym I never really cared what I ate meaning that I could stay until 5 pm without eating because I was too lazy to cook anything and then because I was too hungry I would put a lasagna or pizza in the oven. Next, before going to sleep I would eat a few more sandwiches and that would be all for a normal/typical day.  Almost 2 years ago now I had a similar attempt in which I started going to the gym, but that only lasted for 2 months before I got bored of eating only rice and chicken because that's what I thought I had to eat. Although I didn't stick to it, it was a really good introduction into the fitness lifestyle and nutrition altogether as I learned a lot of things. Starting last December, I was really motivated, and I had a few goals in my mind, one of them being that I really wanted to be more active and have a healthier lifestyle and another funny one was that I wanted to see my bicep veins. One thing that stood in my mind the whole time was that I will not give up before reaching 3 months into ICF. ***** # Progress  **Cutting** 01/01/2019 to 24/03/2019   As you can see in the initial picture, I was already going to the gym for like 3 weeks and my muscles already got a ""toned"" appearance. From the first day I started counting my calories with the MyFitnessPal application and I kept a diary with my exercises. It was a pretty harsh period as I was cutting and doing intermittent fasting and during the nights when I was really hungry, I would stay at my computer and read or learn new recipes or things about exercises in the gym. One thing that was really helpful and remained within my mind till now was whenever I had any lust for something sweet or unhealthy, I would repeat the following: ""STAY CONSISTENT"", phrase that I learned from Buff Dudes on Youtube! From the exercise point of view during ICF and cutting period I got my compound movements to the following levels: (I'm sorry, but I never tried my 1RM in any of the exercises) Squats: empty bar -> 77.5 kg / 170.8 lbs for 5 reps Bench Press: 30 kg -> 67.5 kg / 148.8 lbs for 5 reps Barbell Row: empty bar -> 55 kg / 121.2 lbs for 5 reps Deadlift: 30 kg -> 100 kg / 220.4 lbs for 5 reps Overhead Press: empty bar -> 37.5 kg / 82.6 lbs for 5 reps As you may know in ICF/SS you always increase your weight by 2.5 kg / 5.5 lbs and overall Squats and OHP were the exercises which really made me struggle with progressing. But overall was a great experience and I got my abs to show and my bicep vein to pop as I always wanted.  From the nutrition point of view I used intermittent fasting 17-7(17 hours interval without eating, 7 hours interval of eating) and I started with eating around 1900 kcal(45% carbs/ 30% protein/ 25% fat) which I then lowered till 1750 at some point as I wasn't losing any more weight and I was doing High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) around 2 times a week in order to help with the deficit as at some point you should stop lowering your calories and increasing your cardio level. I still drank alcohol like once per month. Once I hit my lowest week of under 68 kg, I was still thinking of lowering my body fat, but that would interfere with my muscle I thought so I stopped and switched to a clean bulk. **Bulking** 25/03/2019 - present I think I should start from the beginning with how my strength increase in the last 3 and a half months, but I still didn't try any of my 1RM, so all I have to give you is my 4-5RM: Squats: 77.5 kg / 170.8 lbs -> 105 kg / 231.4 lbs for 5 reps Front Squats: 75 kg / 165.3 lbs for 10 reps Bench Press: 67.5 kg / 148.8 lbs -> 82.5 kg / 181.8 lbs for 5 reps Deadlift: 100 kg / 220.4 lbs -> 130 kg / 275.5 lbs for 4 reps Overhead Press: 37.5 kg / 82.6 lbs -> 45 kg / 99.2 lbs for 5 reps (I feel like I'm still lacking strength in this exercise) Barbell Row: 55 kg / 121.2 lbs -> 80 kg / 176.3 lbs for 5 reps PHUL is an incredible routine and a great follow up for ICF as you have much more freedom with your number of repetitions/sets. During the bulk I started with around 2500 calories and right now I am eating around 3150 calories daily (55% carbs/25% protein/20% fat). I don't really have cheat meals unless I am on vacation and I don't really have any other choice. **Overall diet**  I always try to keep my diet diversified and try new recipes or at least change the spices that I use in certain meals, so I won't get bored. Here's a picture of what I had a few days ago ([Picture](https://imgur.com/a/Mvp0ETt)) and you can see that I usually have only one meal that contains meat and most of the times I eat oats twice a day, but cooked differently as I love it so much and as it is the most micronutrient dense cereal. The whole meal prep for that day took me 35 minutes with washing the dishes afterwards!  I never surpass 2.5g of protein per kg and I try to keep my fats always in between 50-80g.  It might be hard sometimes having to cook and preparing so much food, but in the end, you will be thankful for everything that you put into your body. *Supplements*: I drink a shake containing protein(amount is between 15-25g depending on my macros for the day), glutamine (5g), creatine(5g), BCAA(5g) and I also take multivitamins whenever I feel like I didn't eat enough vegetables and micronutrients overall, fish oil which I take daily and I started to take zinc & magnesium about a week ago before going to bed. *****  #Conclusion  Overall, I feel like this is the best period of my life thanks to how much I changed my lifestyle. Right now I will keep bulking as I just changed my routine to PHAT and I hope to increase my muscle mass and my overall strength. Right now, I am not really sure until when I want to keep bulking, but it will all depend on how I look, but probably I will keep bulking till I get to around 80 kg / 176.3 lbs. But yeah, this was my experience these last 7 months and I hope I motivated some of you to start TODAY, as we only have one life and EVERYDAY counts! *Further goals*: Get my bench press to 100 kg / 220.4 lbs before 1 year of training and being able to do a single muscle up. (I will need to change my gym for this, as I don't have enough space in my current one in order to even try it. Thank you and sorry for any written mistakes as English is not my first language. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them as I'd talk about this topic for days, but I didn't want this post to get any longer than it already is. ***** EDIT: Thank you so much for all your support and positive feedback! Yesterday when I started writing, I was thinking at some point about not posting it as I thought that people might not like what I'll say and that I'll just embarrass myself.  I see that many of you are asking for some more complex details regarding my nutrition plan as in what are some of my recipes and stuff. For that I should make a whole other post as I need to write a lot about this topic. I'll be thinking about this and maybe I'll write it over the weekend! Thanks again and STAY CONSISTENT!",This guy’s progress in 6 months is better than my progress after a year wtf,223
cfwceh,"I have been working out since last 2 years. For the first year, being a complete beginner, I did whatever my old gym buddies asked me to do (Bro split) and since last 1 year I have been following 6 days PPL program.  Since I do not have enough time to split my workouts in 2 sections where I can dedicate a slot to cardio alone, I prefer doing sprints on the treadmill after I am done lifting heavy weights.  Now, this new trainer has joined my gym as the ""Master Trainer"" or whatever and he is the head of all the other trainers. Dude has been bugging me since day 1 and these are the things he constantly is talking about-  1. Where did you get this PPL program from? How do you know its good for your body? People on the internet do not know about your heart rate, your recovery speed, your muscle type and thats why following random program from the internet might harm you.  2. Do not do HIIT or any form of high intensity workout since you do not know your recovery rate, you do not even know if your muscles are recovering enough to do same body part 2 times a week.   Does any of this make any sense? I think he just is trying to sell his personal training to me and I really would like to know if the above factors mentioned by him matter at all.",>he just is trying to sell his personal training to me Yup.,5345
cg9c8d,"Hello all, &#x200B; First, this is not a post about exercise. This is a post about going to a gym! I notice that every once in a while someone asks a question about gyms: joining them, using them, etiquette, etc. I also noticed that there isn't much about using or accessing gyms in the wiki, so hopefully this gets added (or not, if it's not useful). If you're new to getting in shape and want to use a gym for that, I hope this will answer any questions you may have. This is based on my personal experience, and I'm sure many of you will have ""but my gym doesn't do it this way"" comments, so please feel free to comment and I'll adjust accordingly. Without further ado, let's talk about gyms! &#x200B; **What and why** A gym is a place that makes working out easier. It's usually a space dedicated to some form of physical activity that allows members to reach their fitness goals. Gyms vary quite drastically in what they offer, how they offer it, what they prioritize, etc. While you don't have to join a gym to get active or hit your fitness goals, it usually gives you access to equipment and resources you can't get otherwise (like weights, cardio equipment, pools, personal trainers, etc.). Unless you're hitting a specific exercise (running or swimming, for example), joining a gym is an easy way to get access to those resources. Different gyms will prioritize different aspects of fitness and well-being. Most large gyms are all-rounders: they try to cater to weightlifters, bodybuilders, yoga enthusiasts, swimmers, runners, etc. Some gyms are more specialized: for example, some may have weights only. Or some might be single function (and probably not be called a gym at all): wall-climbing, yoga studios, Pilates studios, etc. What you join should depend on your goals, and this guide will cover as much as possible to help you decide and navigate the gyms. &#x200B; **What you would find at the gym** **The reception**: almost without fail, there will be a desk at the front where someone will greet you and check that you're a member before letting you in. The people at the front desk are sometimes also trained as sales people, so they might try to sell you stuff, but once you're a member, they're there to help you out. **Free weights**: this will be one of the the most common items you'll find in gyms. The most basic weight option will probably be a [rack of dumbbells](https://www.tuffstuffitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TuffStuff-Evolution-3-Tier-Dumbbell-Rack.jpg), but you'll also see free weights, [Olympic barbells](https://www.titan.fitness/media/catalog/product/cache/8/thumbnail/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/8/6/86obar-v2-1_3.jpg), benches, [racks](https://samsfitness.com.au/image/cache/catalog/atx-fs-240/atx-professional-half-rack-800x800.jpg), and all sorts of muscular [individuals](http://5stepmarketing.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gym-owner.jpg) hauling these weights around. The variety and scale of equipment depends on the clientele, with some gyms having a much bigger area dedicated to weightlifting. **Resistance** [**machines**](https://ua.all.biz/img/ua/catalog/1949352.jpeg): these vary greatly in variety and function. Most will have some sort of weight selection, and they will mostly focus on one muscle or muscle group in the workout. While not very popular in r/Fitness, they do serve a function and are sometimes necessary (for example, they're good for back exercises). Some of them will have [cables](https://5.imimg.com/data5/FC/NY/MY-2277102/lat-pulldown-machine-500x500.jpg), some will have complex [levers](https://www.fitnessfactoryoutlet.com/images/products/12338.png), and almost all will have a small [guide](https://sep.yimg.com/ay/fitnessgiant/legend-fitness-selectedge-shoulder-press-machine-1101-12.png) on how to adjust the machine, how to use it, and which muscles it targets. **Cardio** [**equipment**](https://www.noosaaquaticcentre.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Noosa-Aquatic-Gym.jpg): these are typically [treadmills](https://iconfitness-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,fl_progressive,fl_lossy,dpr_1.0,w_800/v1/site-51/NTL17219_gallery_1_L%402x.jpg), elliptical machines, stationary bikes, rowing machines, and other devices that allow you to perform cardiovascular exercises without changing your location. They'll more often than not be seen in rows, usually opposite the windows or mirrors. As their name suggests, they help get your heart-rate up. They're probably the easiest to use, as you probably can run or cycle. **Body-weight and suspension area**: better equipped gyms might also have an area that seems somewhat emptier and allows for more freedom of movement, but might have a device like this [suspension rack](https://theclublg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TRX_SFrame.jpg), and might have the big bouncy balls, or thick ropes attached to racks. These areas are designed for body-weight exercises, and will often attract personal trainers or even small group classes in ""[bootcamp](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2018/08/08/5b747cf380eb35045d8b4f36.png)"" format. **Studios**: a [studio](http://www.dancestudioforfar.co.uk/s/cc_images/cache_8440126.jpg?t=1506983348) is an area that is somewhat separated from the rest of the gym, usually by glass walls and doors, usually has mirrors on one side, and will sometimes have a stage. Studios are used for things like yoga classes, group exercise classes, etc. You might find yoga mats or exercise balls in there. Some are specialized: they might cycling studios or Pilates studios. Studios are usually open to members if there isn't an active class, and they're good for stretching or warming up/cooling down. **Specialized equipment**: some gyms have climbing walls, swimming pools, etc. It's worth asking about these if anything interests you. **Group exercise classes**: many gyms offer these classes (Les Mills, Spinning, yoga, Pilates, etc.). These are sometimes part of your membership, and are sometimes extra. You should check with your gym on if they have them and how you can sign up. **Gender-specific areas**: other than the obvious ones (showers and bathroom) some gyms might have female-only areas: could be a class, could be a studio, could be a certain time in the week. If you're female and would a ""safer"" environment, you can always ask about these **Showers & sauna**: most gyms will have lockers, changing rooms, showers, and some will have hair dryers, ironing boards, saunas, steam rooms, jacuzzis, etc. These are not important to everyone, but a shower might be worth confirming if you're planning on showering after a workout. Many gyms will also offer towels (a small one to carry around and a big one to dry yourself after showering). **Personal trainers**: as the name suggests, these individuals dedicate their time to just you in the gym! PT sessions are usually an hour to 90-minutes each, and are designed to help you focus and get better results. PTs are not for everyone. First, they're expensive. Second, they need you to agree on a predefined time and place to exercise. Third, you might not need them if you've been doing this for a while. However, they can be good if you're an absolute noob and prefer someone to handhold you for the first month or so. PT sessions are sold by the # of sessions, and can used over a specific period. Check with your gym on what options they may have. **Chillout area**: some of the nicer gyms will have a lounge area, with coffee, a juice bar, etc. available to the members. This isn't really related to exercise, but having an area like that makes a gym more appealing to some. &#x200B; **Cool, sound like fun! Where do I start?** First, find a convenient gym. I highly suggest a place that is either near work or near home; anything too far will lead to excuses for not going. You also need to make sure your gym has the equipment/timing/price that's good for you. Google is your friend (and I guess Yelp). Once you have one or two options, head down before the day you intend to start working out. Walk up to the reception and ask them for a tour of the facilities, and about their pricing options. I suggest you go the gym around the time you intend to work out, to see how busy it is. Don't forget to see the showers and lockers. Before signing up for a long-term contract, see if you can get a test run (some will give you a 3 day trial, some have one-month options). A one-month option helps you see if a gym is really for you (some people will always prefer to run/cycle/swim outdoors). If there are several gyms that are convenient location-wise, I suggest you see them all before signing any commitments. A small note: while in general gyms and gym-goers are welcoming, some gym environments could be toxic (judgmental, show-offy, superficial). Don't be discouraged! That's why I suggest trying a gym out for a month, to make sure the environment is positive and supportive. You need to find a place that you'll be happy going to. Second, once you've settled on the gym, get ready on the day you want to go. Wear some comfortable clothes and shoes, pack a change of clothes (if you need to change), a bottle of water, and head to the gym (I wouldn't initially worry about things like gloves or wraps; you won't need those for a while). At the reception, check in and ask for a towel (if the gym provides it), and ask for help for whatever you're trying to do: if it's weights, ask them for help with the weight area, cardio, ask for help with the machines, etc. The staff should be able to orient you and give you the basics of the gym. Ask about any special rules (use of chalk, grunting, music, etc., some have funny rules). At this point you should follow whatever program you've researched before. Remember, this is not a working out guide! Third: shower and change, and congrats! day one is done! Keep in mind that a gym is not the cleanest of environments, so make sure you also wash your bottle, etc. &#x200B; **Gym etiquette** The most important thing you need to keep in mind is that no one in the gym cares about what you look like, how much you weight, and what exercises you perform. Having said that, a gym is a common area, so it pays to be considerate. While exercising, observe the room. See how people wait for machines to be ready, how they behave, etc. Look for signs that talk about rules (for example, some gyms limit cardio machine usage ). If you're unsure about something, ask. Unless they're in the middle of their workout, most people are more than happy to help. The gym staff are there to help, so always feel free to ask them as well. **Weights**: if you're weightlifting, you're going to rest between sets. If the gym is busy, it is good form to share: other people can use the machines/devices/weights while you're resting between sets. Racks (squat, bench) get busy and sharing helps everyone move more quickly. Quick note: if you're sharing equipment/machines, and you're listening to music, male sure you take your headphones/earphones off so you can communicate. You need to hear your buddy. This is especially important if you're ever spotting someone. If you're using a bench or a seat, it's good form to place a towel where you might sweat on it, and wipe it down after you're done. Before grabbing weights from a machine/bar, check to see if someone is still using them (asking won't harm). Always return your weights to the weight rack. Don't be the disruptive asshole (grunting loudly, dropping weights). If you're unsure about something, or need help with an exercise, ask other people who are not actually working out. The big buff guys are probably the nicest as they usually remember what it was like being a beginner. Some seasoned lifters in here pointed out that dropping weights and grunting are part of the workout. That's very true, but doesn't mean you get to be an asshole about it. Is there rubber on the floor? Is there a deadlift area? Are you grunting in effort or to show off? Again, it's really about being considerate. **Cardio**: observe the time limit if there are people waiting, and wipe your sweat off when you're done. **Studio use**: return everything you use in there. Turn off the lights if necessary. Don't drop weights on the wooden floor. **Body weight area**: make sure there isn't a class or someone else using the equipment. If it's an individual, ask if sharing is ok. If it's a class, either join in/sign up, or wait for it to finish. **Group classes**: these usually need you sign up early, and your membership needs to include them. Always put your equipment away after the class is done, or wipe your sweat puddle. Think of people using the gym after you.",For weights please add in: DONT WORK OUT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE WEIGHT RACK. MOVE TO ANOTHER AREA.,1903
cgh8tk,"First off: I am so proud of the hard work and dedication everyone in this sub shows. You have all inspired me and because of that, I'd like to pass on my thoughts, routine, and results. # Tl;dr * 4.5 months * 220 lbs → 183 lbs * 20.1% BF → 9.9% BF * Current Goal: 8% BF * Long-term Goal: 8-10% BF up to 200 lbs &#x200B; **Pics & stats** (: [Progress Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/5pTKTqy)) *Sex*: Male *Age*: 31 years old *Height*: 6'1'’ *Before I started cutting*: 03/02/2019 - 220 lbs *Current weight (last weigh in):* 07/15/2019 183.2 lbs *Goal weight:* 180 - not necessarily a goal but I would think I need to lose another 2-3 lbs to get to my BF% goal of 8 percent. *Long-term goal:* 8-10% body fat at 200 lbs - wouldn't that be a dream? # Background I’ve been going to the gym regularly for most of my adult life but it wasn’t until March 2019 that I decided to seriously take a look and dedicate time to understanding my body and seek assistance for diet, macro counting, and splits. I thought I could do this work on my own but when my macro counting has been terrible. I didn’t know how to do this, it was overwhelming, and quite honestly not very intuitive to macro count. I was putting waaaay too much into my body, and when the scale kept going up, I truly wondered why my body wasn't changing the way I wanted (frankly, NEEDED) it to do. My lifestyle was fairly sedentary, I’d go hiking occasionally but outside of the gym 5 times a week, I didn’t do much but sit even when I got home. From 03/02/2019 - 07/15/2019 my days have been twice a day at the gym, early morning target cardio (plan below and what that means) and then heavy lifting in the afternoon. Depending on how I feel, this is usually six days a week.  # Current Lifestyle I’m a software consultant, sitting behind a desk 5 days a week. My life, outside of working out two times a day, six days a week, is pretty sedentary, even today, so I have to be hyper aware of my nutrition and ensure that my food intake is as clean as possible.  **Actual Workout** **(03/02/2019 - 07/01/2019)** At the beginning from March through June, I was hitting every major muscle group around once a week. My splits would look something like: Day 1: Legs Day 2: Delts + Target Cardio Day 3: Back Day 4: Chest + Target Cardio Day 5: Arms Day 6: Delts - because they’re STUBBORN + Target Cardio Day 7: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Cardio **07/02/2019 - Present** Tracking the photos, I knew what areas were weakest. My trainer put a plan in place to help adjust to focus more on my weaker areas so my splits changed. Also note: I added targeted cardio daily to the workout routine to help cut more. Cardio consists of *at least* 45-mins targeting heart rate at 115 - 135 bpm, my body's fat burn zone. Side note: targeted cardio can be done walking on a treadmill, it's boring, so find some music, tv, anything to get through it.  The other thing is what works for me, may not work for you. Know your body, its limits, and what you can accomplish and what areas you need to focus on. My trainer has been a huge asset in helping me understanding my own body and what areas I need to work on. Day 1: Legs + Mid-back; Target cardio Day 2: Chest; Target cardio Day 3: Back/biceps (lat dominant); Target cardio Day 4: Delts/core; Target cardio Day 5: Legs/triceps; Target cardio Day 6: Chest/light delts; Target cardio Day 7: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Cardio; abs My delts and lats continue to be pretty stubborn and I'm slowly realizing I'll always have to go after them in the gym multiple times a week. **Overall diet** I am a creature of habit, my diet is pretty boring, especially when I find something good I usually keep it in my week. For that reason, I’m just going to show my macro counts because I’m not eating anything special. I adjust my macro intake based on what muscle group I’m working on. Larger muscle groups will have higher carbs and protein; smaller groups will be higher fats and protein, low carbs. **Back and Legs (Large muscle group)** \-  I try to consume around 1734 Kcal, which will consist of 46% Carbs; 46% proteins; 24% fats. **Arms/rest day (smaller muscle group) -** Calories: 1562 Kcal, which consists of 26% carbs; 32% proteins; 42% fats **Chest/delts (smaller muscle group) -** Calories: 1728 Kcal, which consists of 27% carbs; 30% proteins 43% fats. GET A FOOD SCALE. GAME. CHANGER. Meal prep in general is a struggle for me, it takes me about two hours overall on a Sunday. I know, not that much,  but my god, time is so limited, that’s the last thing I want to do. So crafting recipes that I can throw in a slow cooker, rice maker, insta pot has been a life saver. *Supplements*: I take **L-Carnitine** for fasted cardio; **L-Arginine** (3g) pre-workout; **BCAA** (5g) 3:1:1 ratio during the workout; G**lutamine** (5g) post workout; **Glucosamine** before bed. **Super greens powder** for when I didn’t feel like I didn’t eat enough vegetables that day. # My Thoughts / Takeaways So I’m a little more than four months in and I’m scared. I don’t want to go back to that person I was in March. It’s such a short amount of time I’m scared that I could go back to that person any minute. I know I won’t be able to maintain these incredible results long term - it’s going to get harder and come more slowly, so I know I have to readjust my expectations. Seeing the current results and progress is so addicting. I love seeing my body transform. It’s like a science experiment where I get to experience the results first hand. I feel incredible - I have more energy, more stamina, I fall asleep in 5-mins when I go to bed. I was always hitting high blood pressure for my age and I check my blood pressure periodically and my blood pressure is all in the normal ranges now. The biggest challenge of this process is knowing and being honest with myself. Six days a week, twice a day, is very hard. I may feel like shit after a day at work and I have to know my body - am I fighting exhaustion or am I just in a bad mood? If it’s exhaustion, it’s fine, I can take a day to break or I can go after a nap and it’s going to be alright. Another challenge behind this is the social aspect. People are mean when it comes to this journey! Socializing, going to dinner and drinks after work, I will find anything on the menu to fit my dietary needs for the day. I don’t want to put anyone out, but I often find people don’t like it when I say I’m going to eat a salad, or I won’t drink alcohol at a happy hour. I can brush it off for now. If you have thoughts behind this, please let me know! I’m still learning and would love to know your thoughts.",Pretty insane progress for 4.5 months dude. Congrats!,1233
ckcklt,"I'm An 20 Y/O Male. Begin weight loss start weight: 160kg First picture taken at: 140kg  Current weight: 90kg I was 18 years old when i started and 1.92m tall, haven't grown since then. Before and after pictures: https://m.imgur.com/a/dFEgM2x Diet:  I mainly used Calorie In/Out method with help from MyFitnessPal.  I ate 2700 calories daily  at 160kg till i reached 130kg at started eating 2000 calories daily. I didn't really counted macros i was just keeping track of my calories and trying to eat healthy as much as possible. Excercises:  At 160 kg i only counted my calories and cycled 30 minutes daily 5 days a week. At 145kg i started doing general sports with my brothers and friends such as basketball, football, swimming and running. My way of progressing in these sports was increasing the duration of them. When i reached 125kg i went to the gym for 3 months and was mainly focused on weight lifting.  Gym routine: Dumbell and machine excercises ranged from 8-12 reps at 3-4 sets . Leg excercises ranged from 14-18 reps at 3-4 sets. Deadlifts 10 reps with in/decreasing weights. Bench ranged from 4-8 reps at 3-4 sets. Depending on my motivation. I went to the gym because i had friends from school over the but after 3 months of going to the gym i had lack of time because of school and work and decided to keep training at home  home routine: Dumbell excercises 8-16 reps at 3-4 sets (Value per hand) Chest: 20kg Biceps: 14kg Tricep: 18kg Back: 20kg Shoulders: 14 I cannot go maximum weight at home since i only have 20kg dumbells. I also did a push up challenge where i did 150 push ups daily for a month and half till i reached 90kg. (Took second picture then) For my routines i was assisted by friends and people i knew from the gym. I wish everyone that's busy trying to lose weight the best of luck and keep in mind it won't be easy but but it'll be worth it! Shoutout to everyone on r/Fitness",Freaking awesome man!,601
cmak8g,"I went through almost the entire couch to 5k program to prepare for a 5k and started running the inside track a few weeks prior to the 5k. It was definitely harder than the treadmill but I managed. Then when I did my 5k outside I could hardly run at all. I thought it was because I was getting over being sick but I've tried running outside since then and I have the same problem. I am still able to run on a treadmill just fine, but for some reason my legs hurt so bad very quickly when I run outside. I don't live in the best area so I would have to drive somewhere else to run outside which I find frustrating and in that case I would rather just drive to the gym so I can also lift weights. I went to a store and got fitted for good running shoes and everything and am still struggling. Does anyone have any advice, or is it really just as simple as starting couch to 5k over again, but outside? Edit: you guys are great. Thanks for so many responses. I realize to some this may have been a stupid question but I've gotten a lot of conflicting information from my friends so I thought I'd ask her.","Simple explanation: the treadmill moves the ground for you, the sidewalk doesn't. Extra explanation, if you're running on concrete, it's a whole lot more unforgiving on your joints and muscles. There's also usually a lot more up and down inclines when running outside that make it more difficult. I don't think you'll need to start the program over, but usually it's best to do a mix of indoor and outdoor running. Also, when I'm running on a treadmill, I set it for at least a 2% incline, so off set the differences a bit.",1700
cwg1el,"Hi guys, Previous post was deleted. Hopefully I get it right this time. Been a long time lurker on here and I thought its finally time to give back to the community that helped me so much when I first started lifting. Thank you all for doing what you do and keep inspiring/helping everyone to pursue their fitness goals! **PHOTOS:** [Before and after photo](https://imgur.com/YpGqD3j) **WEIGHT:** 149lb (68KG) to 172lb (78KG) in the photos The 172lb weight represents my weight at the time of the after photo which was at the end of a 'cut'. Weight climbed as high as 189lb during the 'bulk'. **TIME PERIOD** Approximately 4 years of progressive overload and eating at a surplus with a few cuts and breaks from weight training when I was travelling/busy with university. **LIFT PROGRESS SUMMARY** Please note that most of these numbers were achieved at a higher bodyweight of around 183lb (83kg) to 189lb (86kg) and does not reflect my strength when cut down. **Deadlift (Conventional):** 135lb (60kg) to 573lb (260kg) **Deadlift (Sumo):** 135lb (60kg) to 617lb (280kg) **Bench:** 88lb (40kg) to 342lb (155kg) **OHP:**  45lb (20kg) to 232lb (105kg) **Squat:** 135lb (60kg) to 463lb (210kg) \&#x200B; **PROGRAM** My goal was always to be both strong and big so I never really focused entirely on bodybuilding or powerlifting and always combined both training styles into my programming. When I first started I ran a full body workout (i think it was ICF lol) 3 times a week but quickly grew out of it in a few months (wanted to be at the gym more). I then got some help and guidance from a friend who had been lifting for quite some time and he was running a variation of OGUS 753. I followed his template and then slowly started my accessories to it and it slowly adapted into a PPLPPL  split. The split would generally be something along these lines **Monday - OHP  (following Ogus 753 rep schemes) and shoulder accessories** Example workout would be * 5x7 OHP at 75% One rep max * 5x8 Arnold press * 5x20 lateral raises * 5x20 rear delt flies * 5x12 face pulls * 5x12 cable lateral raise * Tricep accessories vary **Tuesday - Hypertrophy Back day** Example workout would be * 10x10 body weight pull ups focusing on lats * 5x12 bent over rows * 4x12 cable pullovers * 5x12 seated row * 5x12 lat pulldown * 5x12 single arm rows * Bicep accessories vary **Wednesday - Squats (Following Ogus 753 rep schemes) and leg accessories** Example workout would be * 10x3 Squats at  85% One rep Max * 5x20 Walking Lunges * 5x12 Leg Hamstring Curl * 5x12 Leg Extension * 5x12 Leg Press * 4x12 Straight Leg Deadlifts **Thursday - Bench (Following Ogus 753 rep scheme) and chest accessories** Example workout would be * 7x5 Bench at  80% One rep Max * 5x12 Incline Dumbell Press * 5x12 Hammer strength machine * 5x12 Chest Fly top down * 5x12 Chest fly bottom up * 4x25 Push ups * 5x12 Landmine presses **Friday - Deadlifts (Following Ogus 753 rep schemes) and back accessories** Example workout would be * 6x6 Deadlift at 70% One rep Max (Deload) * 5x10 Pull ups (weighted) * 5x8 Rowing movement * 5x8 Lat pulldown * Bicep accesories if there is time Saturday - Rest or if I ended up gyming would be a hyper chest day **Sunday - Hypertrophy leg day** Example workout would be * 5x10 front squads * 5x10 close stance squat * 5x12 good girl bad girl machine (each side) * 5x5 hip thrusts I would also do core every second day which is usually just 5x12 hanging leg raises and 5x12 decline sit ups with weight behind head. Obviously working out 7 days is not ideal for everyone and I would highly recommend at least taking a day off but It seemed to work for me and my body was handing it pretty well so i continued to do so (i don't anymore fyi haha) I basically followed this split for about 2.5 years and had probably gone from 154lb to about 178lb at this point and then started to stall on my lifts (especially on 10 sets of 3 at 85% for most of my lifts -  those workouts are brutal and it takes over an hour to even get through just your compounds LOL) Anyway at this point I think my lifts were S - 419lb (190kg)                    B- 264lb (120kg)                  D(sumo) - 551lb (250kg) However with progress slowing down, I looked online for a different program that aligned with my goals. Thats when I found Layne Nortons PH3. A few of my friends at the gym had run this program already at this point so I asked around and the general consensus was that it was hard but a good program. So i decided to run it. [Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Yq5-rlDPc_FrkNGjzTbOPN-ym5ixH9AGV7agowx-JvU) \- to the spreadsheet i used to track this FYI After completing PH3 my numbers were around S - 463lb (210kg)           B- 315lb (142.5kg)                    D(Sumo) - 617 (280kg) Which I was pretty happy with for 3 months of training. However the program is definitely hard and I would highly recommend not taking the AMRAP sets to failure as the fatigue definitely builds up (i ended up with a very sore hip and elbow after many sessions). Still would highly recommend PH3 to most people though. Now it brings us to current time. I'm sitting at around 191lb (86.5kg) and I've been running Smolov Junior bench because I can't squat (torn quad from going too ham after coming back from a holiday lol) and been deadlifting once a week. I've gone back to a PPLPPL split but been adding bench on top of normal workouts (not doing many push accessories though) Recently maxed out bench and hit 342lb (155kg) but really gunning for that 160kg bench (353lb) \&#x200B; **DIET** Diet hasn't changed significantly over the last few years with bulking diet and cutting diet remaining pretty similar apart from portion size. Below is a typical day of eating for me when cutting down **Breakfast** Toast, Peanut Butter, Cereal, Milk/Almond Milk, Eggs with Egg whites if I can be bothered and Fruit **Lunch** 300g cooked protein source (Chicken breast, Chicken Tenderloins, Beef, Salmon, Beef mince) 300g Cooked carb source (Wholemeal pasta, Sweet potato, Brown rice, Basmati Rice) 200g Vegetable (Brocolli, Beans, Asparagus, Frozen Vege mixtures etc) These meals are usually split into 150g protein, 150g carb and 100g vege containers (I meal prep around 18 of these a week). If i can I space these meals out 2 hours so i technically have 2 lunches. **Dinner - Post Gym** 150g protein source 150g carb source 100g vege Protein Shake (Double scoop if requried) **Snack** Some form of protein bar or snack that im craving (rice crackers usually) Usually this adds up to about 2600-2700 calories when im cutting. When im bulking, the meals are almost the same but I may have bigger breakfasts, more snacks and my meals increase from 150g protein carb to 200g protein and carb. I generally eat around 3500-3600 calories when im bulking. My macro targets are usually around 200g protein, 60-80g fat and the rest carbs no matter if im bulking or cutting. When I bulk, im probably at a 80% clean food 20% ""cheat"" food ratio although i would say my cheat food is not considered cheat food all the time. I make conscious decisions on eating protein rich junk foods like I would consider subway footlong a 'cheat' food for me when I am dieting. **STORY** I won't go too indepth but basically I have always been into sport (mainly playing soccer/football) but once I got into university, I stopped exercising and started living alone which made me extremely lazy. I would always go the whole day eating one normal meal and would spend a lot of my time playing video games. I started getting really bad acne on my face which made me super self conscious and slowly made me more and more anti social (gyming actually didnt help this and i had to eventually seek professional help for this). Thats when I decided that something needed to change so  I started working out at home. Around this time was when i started browsing /r/fitness and realized that I should probably be working out in a gym so i resigned up to my university gym and the rest is history! I am extremely glad that i made that decision that day to resign up for the gym as now a lot of my closest friends are at/from the gym and I genuinely look forward to going in everyday. So thank you /r/fitness for changing my life :) If you want to see the full transformation, message me on here and I can link you the video as transformation videos aren’t allowed here. Thank you all for reading and keep training hard! We're all gonna make it brahs. Edit: Fixed the excel spreadsheet link to Ph3. I'm truly overwhelmed by how much this has blown up and i'm trying to reply everyone as best I can. Please give me some time and i'm sorry if I miss you! Thank you all for the support :)",My favorite thing about these posts are the hair gains. Somewhere along the way people always figure out how to style their hair lol,970
cy80uu,"Hello, some of you may remember me for making these kinds of posts awhile back. I have still been reading a lot and I wanted to write up another post for everyone again. As usual, this is solely for educational purposes and I hope to encourage a lot of discussion below. Something cool to note is that all of these papers were published this year! A short review on training to failure and its implications on muscle hypertrophy (muscle growth) by Schoenfeld & Grgic (2019) was recently published. Training to failure is the method of training where repetitions within a set are done until proper form in the exercise cannot be executed. This practice is actually rather common in training programmes because it is theorized that it accumulates more metabolic stress in the muscles and has higher motor unit recruitment. Metabolic stress and hypertrophy do not have a simple relationship as of now even though it is commonly thought that more metabolic stress would lead to more hypertrophy. Motor unit recruitment is how the body will activate specific motor units in order according to the load the muscles must overcome. A motor unit is defined by the muscle fibers that are stimulated by one motor neuron (a nerve, essentially). According to Henneman’s size principle, fatigue-resistant, small, weaker motor units will be recruited first and if required, larger and stronger motor units will be activated. In the context of failure, load is important because high loads (failure or not) will recruit all motor units immediately which makes the motor unit recruitment benefit of failure, null. It is important to describe what the literature generally compares training to failure against. A common alternative is a technique where the endpoint of a set is where you believe you can only do one or two more repetitions. The authors found that studies showing training to failure to be superior have some design issues. For example, Goto, Ishii, Kizuka, Takamatsu (2005) had these results but the group that did not train to failure had inter-repetition rest which does not reflect how people usually train. Normally, you would complete all your repetitions and rest once the entire set is completed. It is possible that without the inter-repetition rest, both groups would have had similar hypertrophy outcomes. There are studies where both methods result in similar hypertrophy amongst participants. Nobrega et al. (2018) had 32 participants perform either high loads or low loads to failure or not to failure in leg extensions. Quadricep cross-sectional area was similar between failure and non-failure conditions. At this point, there clearly is not enough data to infer any solid conclusions regarding training to failure. Regardless, some potential practical implications are the use of frequency and exercise selection for failure. Training to failure can be taxing on the body. Izquierdo et al. (2006) had a group training to failure twice a week for 16 weeks and they had a lower number of hormones like testosterone that would help with muscle growth. Therefore, if failure is in a training programme, it may be wise to limit its use to once a week, once every other week or at the end of a mesocycle (a programme) where you are peaking with volume. Exercise selection may also be important as failure for multi-joint movements such as the bench press or the squat may be more taxing than single-joint movements like a bicep curl or a leg extension. **tl;dr:** Hard to say if training to failure has any benefits over training just shy of failure. Regardless, it can be dangerous if used improperly so its implementation into a training programme must be done carefully. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — A common response to fatigue from strenuous exercise is to consume water. The body becomes dehydrated over time with intense activity and it is important to rehydrate. However, is it possible that plain water consumption may have an adverse effect on the body during/after exercise? Lau, Kato & Nosaka (2019) recently investigated the effects of water consumption on exercise-associated muscle cramps and how water compares to an oral rehydration solution (Gatorade). Previous hypotheses suggested that exercise-associated muscle cramps were related to electrolyte abnormalities (diminished minerals like sodium or potassium during exercise). Unfortunately, amongst several problems, electrolyte abnormalities would not explain such a localised manifestation (a cramp in only one muscle) rather than a systemic one and it would not explain why stretching the muscle provides relief. Modern theory proposes that it is more of a neural disorder where there is an imbalance between the golgi tendon organ and the muscle spindles. The golgi tendon organ is located at both ends of muscles and it serves to prevent over-contraction. Muscle spindles are wrapped around the muscle fibres which perform the opposite (prevents over-stretching). Despite that, it would be careless to completely eliminate electrolytes from the equation in regards to exercise-associated muscle cramps. In this study, 10 healthy men drank either water or Gatorade after downhill running in a cross-over fashion (all 10 participants would try both beverages, one beverage one week and another the next week). Blood tests would be done before, immediately after and 80 minutes after the run. To determine the intervention’s effect on cramps, electrical stimulation would be applied to calf until a cramp could be induced otherwise known as the threshold frequency. If the threshold frequency was lower, it would imply that you were more susceptible to cramps. Dehydration had no effect on cramp susceptibility. Cramp susceptibility increased with water but decreased with Gatorade. Cramp susceptibility actually decreased lower than baseline with Gatorade. This reduced cramp susceptibility is unlikely related to electrolytes because Gatorade did not actually increase electrolytes to a significant extent according to the blood tests. Gatorade did, however, have glucose which may have had an effect on cramp susceptibility. This, along with how long cramp susceptibility is increased with water, should be looked into more scrupulously in future studies. **TL;DR:** Water intake after exercise may actually lead to a higher chance of having exercise-associated muscle cramps when compared to Gatorade intake. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Squats are a popular lower-body exercise as it increases lower body strength, stimulates lower body hypertrophy and has good translation into the performance of important movements like jumping. There has been some doubt as to what is the optimal range of motion for a squat. Deep squats have been shown to have higher muscle activation but it is not entirely impossible that shallow squats lead to comparable strength/muscle size gains. Kubo, Ikebukuro & Yata (2019) sought out to compare the two squat variations amongst 17 healthy males. The participants were either put into a group that did deep squats (knee angle of around 140 degrees) or a group that did shallow squats (knee angle of around 90 degrees, about parallel). The groups were matched according to baseline characteristics and physical ability. Subjects were physically active but none of them followed any specific training programme within the past year. The entire programme lasted 10 weeks with a training frequency of twice a week. Two familiarization sessions were done before the 10 weeks to get used to proper squat form and to determine 1 repetition maxes (maximum load you can squat within one repetition). Each proper training session involved three sets. Participants worked up to 90% of their 1 repetition maximum for 8 repetitions for a few weeks. 5kg would be added to the load if they could complete the 8 repetitions. Outcomes measured were squat 1 repetition maxima and various muscle sizes including all the quadriceps, the hamstring muscles, hip adductors and the gluteus maximus. This study is the first to directly measure glute and hip adductor hypertrophy in response to squats. Muscle size was measured with serial MRI images which is the gold standard for muscle size measurement as it can differentiate between muscles and distinguish muscle, intramuscular fat and water. The deep squat group had greater improvements in the deep squat 1 repetition maximum, around 20% better. However, both groups improved in the shallow squat 1 repetition maximum to a similar degree. Quadricep muscles grew about the same between groups. The rectus femoris did not grow to a significant extent in either group (which is in-line with previous research). This is likely because the rectus femoris muscle is a biarticular muscle (a muscle which crosses two joints). When you ascend in the squat, the rectus femoris will try to contract to help with knee extension but it will also stretch as the hip extends. This leads to the muscle being about the same length throughout the entire movement. The hamstring muscles in both groups grew similarly. The gluteus maximus and the hip adductors hypertrophied (grew) more in the deep squat group although not by much. These results can only be applied to untrained males. **TL;DR:** In untrained males, deep squats may lead to better strength gains in the deep squat and may have better hypertrophy outcomes in the gluteus maximus as well as the hip adductors. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Foam rolling is the use of foam cylinders, sticks, bars or various other foam equipment for self-massage either before or after exercise in hopes to improve performance or recovery. It is thought to have effects on the thixotropy of muscles which is just another way of saying that it is able to reduce muscle stiffness. They may also help with myofascial trigger points or “knots” in your muscle but the physiology behind all of this is controversial and is a story for another day. Other potential benefits is that it can reduce muscle soreness and increase blood flow to muscles. Wiewelhove et al. (2019) developed a meta-analysis on the subject to see if foam rolling really works. A meta-analysis is the pooling of several studies together to control sampling variance and to get a better idea of the data at a population level. The analysis was bifurcated into foam rolling before exercise and foam rolling after exercise. Pre-rolling had small effects on sprint performance and flexibility and essentially no effects on strength and jump performance. Post-rolling had small effects on sprint/strength recovery and muscle pain perception. Otherwise, post-rolling had nothing to show for. While the data for foam rolling was not impressive, it is possible that foam rolling is still relevant for elite athletes. This is because very small improvements in performance are still valuable if your variation in performance is very narrow. If you are a novice, your performance is likely to be highly variable and minor improvements will not be able to manifest itself in performance. Despite all this, there are a few issues with the meta analysis. Most of the studies vary in design and how they carried out the investigations. This makes pooling the research very difficult and is known as high heterogeneity. Furthermore, since you are not able to blind study participants or investigators to foam rolling interventions, the potential for bias and placebo effects is high. Adverse effects from foam rolling should also be considered even though it is generally considered to be relatively harmless. Some populations with peripheral nerve or artery diseases may be at an increased risk for possible adverse effects from foam rolling but more research is needed. **TL;DR:** Foam rolling is likely not very beneficial for performance or recovery if you’re not an elite athlete. However, it may not hurt to do it anyways. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Protein is an important macronutrient that amongst many processes, facilitates muscle growth and recovery. Having healthy muscles is important for completing every day tasks and this becomes increasingly critical as we age. Sarcopenia is the gradual loss of muscle mass generally associated with aging. This is tough to combat as the anabolic response to protein decreases as we age. That is to say, old people do not respond as well as their younger counterparts to an equal amount of protein. The elderly also tend to have a poor appetite towards high protein foods like meat which is related to chewing being tougher in that demographic and various metabolic issues. Researchers have taken this issue and have proceeded to look down other avenues for protein supplementation with one of these being plant-based proteins. Berrazaga, Micard, Gueugneau & Walrand (2019) compiled a review of plant-based protein sources and how they fare against animal-based protein sources. While this study was more in the scope of older demographics, it is still relevant to younger people especially those who consume more plant-based foods. Animal proteins are generally more digestible. This may be because their protein structure are mainly alpha-helix based instead of beta-sheets (these are just different ways particles within proteins can be organized) which makes it easier for the body’s enzymes to digest. In regards to digestibility, however, heating the plant-based foods can make its proteins more accessible. Another issue with plant-based proteins is that they lack a variety of essential amino acids. An amino acid is the basic building block of proteins. There are 20 standard amino acids and 9 of them are labelled as “essential amino acids”. These are amino acids that cannot be synthesized within the human body and they can only be obtained from food. Some amino acids can even be essential earlier on in life but then become non-essential as our metabolic systems develop with age. Ideally, a protein source would be able to fulfill the requirements for all essential amino acids. When put directly against animal-based proteins, the animal protein tends to have a much higher muscle protein synthesis rate after consumption. Muscle protein synthesis is the building of muscle via protein. This is only measuring an acute response but even in more long-term studies, animal protein still outdoes plant protein. To alleviate these problems, it has been suggested to simply eat more protein. It was found that 60g of wheat protein was as good as 35g of whey protein in the context of muscle protein synthesis. Combining different plant proteins that complement each other in regards to essential amino acid content may be a solution but has yet to be studied. Some plant proteins with genetic mutations can be selectively bred in order to have better quality protein. This strategy has been shown to work in children when measuring growth rates among them. **TL;DR:** Plant-based proteins may not be as good as animal-based proteins due to their poor digestibility and lacking essential amino acid content. Some strategies to sidestep these issues show promise but it all needs more research especially in the context of sarcopenia. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Berrazaga, I., Micard, V., Gueugneau, M. & Walrand, S.

d1ogxk,"Spent ton of money on several bags of protein. Over the span of an year I keep getting stomach constipation, and diarrhea, always wondering the source of the problem and found out I’m lactose intolerant, (Im Asian) yeah, took me a whole year to find out. Still have tons of protein bags brand new Lying around now completely useless. I’m just wondering what the hell I should do with all this protein. Is it possible to get my body used to whey? Or does all this need to go to the trash?  Also before anyone says it, yeah I know I’m a dumbass. Welp, lesson learned.

Every year I would try a bit to lose weight but never lost more than 20 lbs in most attempts but what changed this last time was me breaking a couple of flimsy ass patio chairs and knew I had to change. Chair pics, left one is how they normally are and the right one is the one I broke after I had to fix it with stronger wood: https://i.imgur.com/jG8bjHJ.jpeg     The bulk of my weight loss happened in the first 6-7 months where I lost about 88 lbs and since then I've been maintaining/gaining/slowly losing the last 13 lbs.      **DIET:** Q:Why did my previous attempts at losing weight failed? A: I had no idea about CICO. I would go to a nutritionist and they would just tell me how much weight I had to lose and what I should be eating but that was it. I would be burned out of the diet they gave me after a couple of weeks. Thanks to the amazing communities like r/fitness and r/loseit I started learning a lot about CICO, macros, IF and other stuff that have been great contributors to my weight loss. For the first 6 months I would religiously log everything I ate into MyFitnessPal but realized I was becoming kind of obsessive with it and haven't used it much in the past year, I only weigh my chicken and rice now but don't log it since I kinda know what the macros and calories are by memory and I eat the same almost every day. My diet right now is:      * **Breakfast:** 2 days a week (Bread, eggs, sausage, some kind of shake) and the other 5 days I just drink black coffee.      * **Lunch:** 2 days a week (take out like japanese or chinese food) and the 5 other days (300-350 gr chicken breast, 250 gr white rice and 500 gr veggies)      * **Dinner:** 2 days a week (take out + 1 scoop protein shake + 5 gr creatine) and the 5 other days (250 gr rice, 4-5 egg whites, 4 full eggs, a source of protein like a tuna can, hot dogs or hamburgers, 1 scoop of protein mixed with oatmeal or yogurt + 5 gr creatine)      I did try keto for a month and lost 11 lbs going from 197 to 186 between the 7th and 8th month but once I had my first cheat meal I couldn't stop eating churros and ice cream for a whole week and gained it all back. It took me 8 more months to lose that amount again.       **EXERCISE:** For the first 6 months I trained at home, have a home gym with only a bench and up to 100 or so pounds on plates, a treadmill and some small dumbbells. I did A LOT of cardio in this time. I wish I had joined the gym sooner but as someone with a lot of anxiety the fear of people judging me was always going to be in my head the more overweight I was. My first routine was:      **Metallicadpa's PPL (3 months):**      * BENCH: 110 lbs -> 187 lbs x 5   * SQUAT: Empty bar -> 220 lbs x 5   * DL: 110 lbs -> 242 lbs x 5   * OHP: Empty bar -> 105 lbs x 5   Bench, deadlift and OHP started to stall and I swapped to my favorite routine yet:      **n-suns 6 days DL version (next 6 months):**      * BENCH: 187 lbs -> 220 lbs x 5   * SQUAT: 220 lbs -> 286 lbs x 3   * DL: 242 lbs -> 341 lbs x 5 (Hook grip ftw!)   * OHP: 105 lbs -> 132 lbs x 5      Unfortunately for the last 3 months I've been dealing with some knee and forearm issues plus the fact that I'm moving to a new country and not wanting to screw any old injuries I haven't been able to progress much and I've kinda stayed at the same weights or lower, only increasing reps on isolation exercises and cardio.      **CONCLUSION:** In the last 1.5 years I've learned a lot, which is my main takeaway from this whole experience, **DO YOUR RESEARCH**   1. Look for different diets,  exercise routines, research papers, everything, until you find what fits you and try to make it something that you can maintain for all your life.   2. One bad meal/day won't completely ruin your progress. Don't beat yourself up and start again stronger tomorrow.   3. Losing weight and looking better won't necessarily fix other issues like depression and anxiety but it helps a bit, at least for me.   4. Yes, diet is probably 90% of the equation but without exercise I'm 100% sure I wouldn't have lasted this long. Start as soon as you can, even only 5 minutes a day at the start is gonna make a big difference.   5. Motivation is gonna be a huge factor for the first couple of months but you definitely gotta build discipline in that time frame since you can only go so far with motivation alone.      Lastly a big shout out to all you amazing people who take the time to comment and help newbies like me and others on the daily questions posts with form checks and stuff, you rock! Also, wednesday and saturdays ain't the same if I can't read rant wednesdays and story saturdays while resting for my next set.      Edit: Added monthly progress and chair pics.","I love posts like this, they give me so much motivation - thank you!",286
d5ydnz,"Hello everyone! The beginning of September marks one year since I started wokring out and I wanted to celebrate by making this post about the journey I never in a million years imagined myself staying on. I knew this post would be long, but it turned out to be way longer than I expected. So, I figured, instead of boring you with text, I’ll turn the whole thing into a bunch of infographics (the vast majority are Dark mode friendly), linked in chronological order. The text below contains more detailed explanations about what changes I made between routines and why. [Total stats and Intro](https://imgur.com/a/3moZyQo); [Routines and Nutrition](https://imgur.com/gallery/0k9Y05Q); [Before and After GZCLP Lifting Stats](https://imgur.com/gallery/OcdmdxO); [Before photos – NSFW and cringy](https://imgur.com/a/fhQsS5i); [After videos - unflexed; not-so-NSFW but also cringy](https://imgur.com/a/ZGzAMiC); [How I made my routines](https://imgur.com/a/OJDyI1e) 1. Who the hell are you and why are you doing this? Growing up, I was a notorious couch-potato and binge-eater. I got quite big and was always trying to lose weight, but I never really had the discipline to stick with any routine I tried. I have terrible hand-to-eye coordination and was always shitty at any sport I tried, so I hated anything exercise-related. After graduating from high-school (May 2017) I tried going keto and for whatever reason actually stuck with it for about half a year. I managed to lose quite a lot of weight just by not eating carb-rich junk food. Then some stuff happened in my life, I got extremely depressed, lost even more weight from not eating, but I had no muscle definition whatsoever and still felt fat (I was not. I was size 36/S at that point.) Around August 2018, at peak depression, I mustered up what little determination I had left and decided to get my shit together and get myself out of this mess. I’d been thinking about exercising and decided it was a nice goal to start with. I’ve been working out almost every day for over a year now and am extremely happy with my progress. For the first time in my life I actually like how my body looks. A couple of weeks ago I went hiking with my family and I had full confidence in my body. I felt incredibly strong the whole time and was full of energy even after a full day of hiking. The reason why this post is so long is because when it comes to exercise, I started basically from scratch and throughout this entire process, I’ve used almost entirely my own research. I study molecular biology, so it was fascinating and an absolute pleasure to see how my studies at uni can illuminate the way I work out (and the other way around). I’ve tried different styles of working out and I thought it would be interesting to describe the entire process in a bit more detail so you can see the whole transition and all the errors I made on the way and how I changed my routine and lifestyle to fix them. I hope you find this interesting and useful. 2. Beginning, September 2018 I had no idea where to start from, but my confidence was way too low to go to the gym. I decided I would do some bodyweight exerices and cardio so I can get in shape and not feel so awkward at the gym. I was technically trying to maintain my weight and just do body recomp, but I was actually hoping to lose more weight. I used an app for  running (Start running – Couch to 5k) and followed along Alexis Ren’s ab and leg routines on YouTube. I also did 30 Days of Yoga with Adriene from her YouTube channel. I used this time to look up how to make my own routine for when I start going to the gym (thank God for YouTube). 3. First routine, October/November 2018 In October I moved out of my hometown for my second year at university. I got a membership for the gym that’s closest to me. For the first three days I used some full-body beginner workouts I found on bodybuilding.com. Going to the gym was a terrible experience. I felt completely out of place, all the equipment was unfamiliar and uncomfortable. My body was not used to moving this way. I got awful DOMS, but I kept going and in a couple of days it went away. 4. Second routine, December/January 2019 I had read that your body adapts to your routine, so it’s good to switch it up every once in a while. I decided two months is a good time. Enough to see some progress, but not enough to get too bored. In hindsight, I could’ve changed the routines every three months because it seemed that just when I got comfortable doing all the exercises and learned proper form, I had to switch it up. For my second routine I used the same layout as last time, just changed the split. I wanted to try doing chest and back together, then arms (biceps, triceps, shoulders) and then legs and abs, but was told it’s not a good idea to train big muscles groups together (like chest and back). So I kept chest and triceps together, then put legs with biceps and back with shoulders. Kept doing abs every other day in pretty much the same way, just followed along a different video. Cardio was starting to become really boring. After reading all the pros and cons of doing cardio before and after your lifts, I started running only for about 10-15 minutes after working out. I managed to do that for a month before realising I don’t have the patience to run after my lifts, so I started jumping rope between my sets instead. One major change I made was related to my sleeping schedule. I started going to bed early, around 9pm so I could get up around 5am. I wanted to lengthen my morning so I could make better use of my time. I’m very happy I made that change and I’m still keeping to this sleep schedule. Getting enough sleep makes all the difference in the world. 5. Third routine, February/March 2019 I believe my second routine was a bit unsuccesful, it felt somewhat awkward. I was also really unsure about what to do next. Thankfully I have a friend who is a licensed fitness instructor and she was kind enough to make a routine for me completely for free. I made a couple changes to it, but overall kept it as it was. This was my first time using supersets and I actually enjoyed it quite a lot. It was also my first time using barbells (for bench presses). I put no weight on them at all and it was still very hard to do 10 reps per set. I was becoming less careful with my nutrition, increasing my calories yet again without really intending to. I was now eating around 1900-2000 calories. I believe this was the time when I reached my lowest weight (51.4 kg), but also somewhat of a turning point as I’ve been slowly gaining weight ever since. Perhaps it was because I was eating more, and also because I was practically doing no cardio at this point, but at the end of these two months I was feeling very big and sluggish. I was looking forward to switching my routine again. 6. Fourth routine, April/May 2019 This time I decided to go all out. I was getting more and more comfortable with the gym, I knew the layout and equipment very well. I was becoming more aware of my body and what I wanted to do with it. I was starting to think my arms and hamstrings were getting too big, so I decided to play around with the sets and reps. I went back to a back and biceps/chest and triceps/legs and shoulders split, but I also added abs to my sets. I did fewer reps with more weight for arms and hamstrings in the hopes of gaining some strength in those areas, but I kept some more hypertrophy-oriented rep ranges for glutes and quads. I was doing cardio once a week and only a short stretch after lifting. 7. First round of GZCLP, June/July 2019 Mkay, so June was kind of big for me. It was the first time I decided that I’m actually happy with how I look and am ready to shift from a more aesthetics-based goal to something more functional. I was becoming more aware of how weak I am (looking at how much literally everyone else at the gym lifts) and wanted to do something about it. I came across the GZCL method and decided I’m going to try it out. This was very different from how I’d trained before for several reasons. First, as I already mentioned, there’s the obvious shift in focus from aesthetics to strength. Second, this is a routine based mostly on compound lifts, whereas before I was mostly doing isolation exercises. Third, both T1s and T2s are performed entirely with barbells, unlike the isolation exercises I was doing, which I performed mostly on machines and with DB. Furthermore, my GZCLP routine is closer to a full-body routine than the split-based workouts I’d been doing so far. I discovered I actually liked the feel of that. Last but not least, because I was now training for strength, I had to rewire my brain to not be afraid of rest. I’d never done such long rests between sets (3min for T1s and 2min for T2s). I still superset my T3s when they work different muscle groups and I do ab exercises during my first three T1 rests. In addition, I initially had a full rest day after each lifting day (so every other day). Eventually I started doing cardio during my off-days. I also started working out first thing in the morning, about an hour after breakfast, and had to shorten my routines to about 1 hour so I’m not late for work. Going back to cardio was really hard at first, but my stamina recovered quickly. I do 35-40min on the treadmill, running at 0 incline and 9.7km/h (6 mph). I usually do 10min of abs as well on my cardio days. 8. Second round of GZCLP, since August 2019 After a couple of weeks of doing GZCLP, I felt a little stuck. I was thinking about switching to a different routine, but I also realised that I was making a couple of mistakes and wanted to see if things would improve with some adjustments. First mistake was not warming up properly. I got pretty close to shoulder injury on my first round (thankfully the pain went away after taking a break from OHP for a week and doing some lighter lifts instead) and I wanted to make sure I’m being safe. I’d only been doing a short 5-min mobility warm-up, which was nowhere near enough. This time I added about 2-3 sets for weight adjustment for both T1 and T2 lifts. My second mistake was adding accessory lifts that don’t necessarily compliment my T1s for the day. I just chose exercises for the muscles I wasn’t hitting as much (biceps, triceps, calves) and randomly spread them around. I was starting to miss glute isolation exercises as well (‘cause who doesn’t want to build dat booty?). You can see the changes I made in the infographic. I’ve been intrested in callisthenics as well, but my upper body is still not strong enough, so I threw in some exercises from dips and pull-up progressions that I do whenever I have the time. Initially I was using a short barbell for my DL and OHP, as well as the Smith machine for Squats. During my second round, I switched to Olympic barbell for both DL and Squats. 9. What next? First things first, I signed up for a jiu-jitsu class! I’ve never done any sort of martial arts before and I’m an extremely unagressive person, never ever ever thought of fighting anyone, so I’m anxious and not sure what to expect, but I’ve been looking into it for a few months now and am really excited as well. In terms of nutrition, I want to go back to meal prepping, because it will make my life easier when I go back to uni in a couple weeks. I’m wondering whether to attempt a lean bulk to gain more strength, but I’m unsure about that yet. I’m trying to get my afternoon eating schedule to be a bit more regular and with a bit less sugar involved. I also want to play around a bit with the timing of my macros, but I need to do some more research on the topic first. In terms of my routine – I’ll be doing GZCLP until I stop making progress. I’ve recently had some pretty good advice about my progression on the gzcl subreddit, so I will implement that on my next reset. I want to try something new for cardio and abs because I seem to have been doing the same thing for a year. Perhaps I sould ditch the treadmill and go back to running outside, it seems to be more challenging. I’ve noticed that my deadlift is a bit weaker compared to the rest of my lifts, so I want to focus a little more on strengthening my lower back and hamstrings by doing a bit of extra accessory work for those muscles. Well, I suppose this is it for now. As always, any and all advice is appreciated. I hope I haven’t bored you to death. 10. Appreciation My sister is an amazing person who got me into both keto and strength training. A gigantic shout-out to my lovely American friends (u/relgabrix, you knew this was coming) who I met through Reddit and who encouraged and supported me this whole time. Last but not least, lots of gratitude to the r/gzcl community for giving me sound advice on all my dumb posts. All infographics made with Canva (and a little bit of Photoshop). **TL;DR** – Lost about 25 kg (55 lbs) with zero exercise, ended up being skinny fat, weak and depressed. Started working out in August 2018, tried different routines, learned a lot, gained some muscle mass, some confidence and some strength. For my routines and some info on nutrition just open all the infographic links. Thank you :) Edit: Added one more link and fixed some typos.   Edit 2: To whoever gave me gold... Wow. Thank you so much! And thank you to everyone for all the support and advice and congratulations. I have to admit I did not expect this to blow up so much.   Since people have been asking, [this](https://symmetricstrength.com/) is the website I used for the GZCLP before and after graphs. I should have added it sooner.",So you just gonna claim that you invented a breakfast sandwich and then not tell us what it is?,658
dl265l,"**BACKGROUND** Male / 5'6"" / 43 yrs Started @ 155lbs Current @ 134  [90 Day Transformation - BEFORE AND AFTER PHOTOS](https://imgur.com/a/ugMeq3z)  **DIET** I started by cutting out sugar and sodas. I substitute sugar with stevia. I stated my macros with a 40/35/25 split of carbs/protein/fat. I choose this macro to ensure I was consuming enough protein in order to minimize muscle loss. I made sure to eat approx 0.85 to 1 gram of protein per 1lb of lean muscle mass in order to minimize muscle loss while dropping weight. When I first started getting serious, I was 155 @ 24% Body Fat. That means I had 118 lbs of lean body muscle (LBM) and 37lbs of fat. Therefore, I would consume 120 grams of protein which is approx 480 calories. The rest of my calories would go into carbs and fat. I'm a very busy parent and making sure I was consuming enough protein was a challenge. So to help out I would drink approx 2 protein shakes daily, one for breakfast and another with dinner. I usually added bananas or other fruits. Sometimes I use peanut butter powder. I hate water in my shakes and found using Silk Almond Milk sugar free only had 30 calories per 8 oz. Worked great as a milk substitute. Lunch usually consisted of oatmeal with cinammon and stevia with some Silk Almond Milk. These were my main carbs for the day. Dinner included a lot of kale salads with veggies. I often added tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced carrots, radishes, etc.. Sometimes I'd add tuna or chicken breast if I needed to mix it up or hit my protein target. Salad dressings were mostly fat free or low calorie (approx 30-60 calories per 2 tablespoons). Sides included microwaved baby red potatoes with some country crock, salt and pepper. These were great as I found my hunger would subside by eating potatoes and noticed the calorie to gram weight was a good balance compared to other types of carbs like chips, pretzels, popcorn or other snacks. Snacks included nuts, plantain chips, orveille redenbacher smart pop popcorn, celery or an apple. **CALORIES** I made sure to calculate my daily Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) without workouts. I then multiplied my TDEE by 7 to get my weekly calories so I knew how much I could consume for the week. I added 3500 to that number to get my maintenance calories. Subtracted 7000 calories so I could lose approx 2lbs per week and divided by 7 to get my daily calories. So, at 155 lbs my TDEE was 1875. Weekly that was 13,125 calories. My total weekly workouts added another 4000-5000 calories for a total of 17,125 to 18,125 calories. From there I would subtract 7,000 calories to get a 2lb weekly weight loss. This meant I could only consume 11,125 weekly or approx 1,600 calories daily. However, it was important that I hit that 4000-5000 calorie weekly workout. **EXCERCISE** Starting around January 2019, I was almost 170 lbs, barely able to wear size 33 pants and really out of shape. I started eating healthier by eating oatmeal, veggies, salads and less fast food. By April 2019, I dropped down to 160. I started counting my steps with a tracker and targeted 10K steps per day. By June 2019 I was down to 155 where I plateaued for 6 weeks. That's when I got fed up at not making any more progress. Here's what happened next. **TOOLS** * Garmin Vivoactive Smartwatch * Jump rope * Wahoo Heart Rate Monitor (HRM) * Food Scale * Weight Scale that calculates Fat Percentage * Tape measure The smartwatch helps me track my daily steps and connects to the Wahoo HRM when I do activities where I don't want to risk damaging my phone (swimming, mud races, etc..) Jump rope is probably the best tool in my arsenal. It's cheap and highly effective in burning calories efficiently. Food scale is a must. I needed to know how much I was consuming so I could target how many calories I could eat on a weekly basis. The weight scale with fat percentage calculation helped show that I was dropping fat % and not just weight. Tape measure to help calculate body fat using online calculators. **SOFTWARE** * MyFitnessPal calorie counter * Garmin Connect activity tracker * Polars Polarbeat activity tracker * SyncMytracks Pro (Android) * Strong (Android) MyFitnessPal is AMAZING! I have it connected to my Garmin Connect Account where my workouts and steps are imported. From there I can see how I'm progressing. I can track my weight and upload photos as motivation. Seeing the progress via photos and graphs REALLY MOTIVATED me. I also use Polars Polarbeat activity tracker for my workouts, primarily because I do heart rate training workouts. From there, SyncMytracks exports my workouts and imports them into Garmin Connect which uploads them to MyFitnessPal. **WORKOUTS** Ok, so I've learned A LOT over the last 3 months. The BIGGEST TAKEAWAY is this... long periods of high intensity cardio is NOT the best for ""cutting"". I learned that short HIIT sessions are MUCH more efficient and effective. Here's my routines: Morning workouts consist of 45 minutes of low intensity cardio. This included riding a bike and jump rope. I would ride my bike and try to keep my heart rate around 115-135 BPM.For me that was approx 65-75% of my MAX HR. In this range, approx 25% of the calories I use/burn in my workout comes from fat which was my main target, not muscle growth. After about 45 minutes, I would transition to a 10 minute HIIT routine where my heart rate is at 90% or more of my Max HR. Afternoon workout consisted of strength training. This is where I would weight lift, low weights high reps and high sets for about 45 minutes. I used the Strong Android app to track my workouts and see my progress. I followed [this article](https://www.coachmag.co.uk/fitness-technology/4355/get-tough-mudder-upper-body-strength) as my workout routine for weight-lifting/strength training routines. Very simple to follow. That's pretty much it. As of now, my goal is to hit 130 lbs @ 10% body fat then start a clean bulk program to build muscle mass. I have approx 2 weeks to go. Hope this helps and if anyone has more questions feel free to ask. EDIT: WOW!!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Thank you kind strangers for my first gold and silver. There are a lot of questions about diet, workouts, tools, etc.... I'll update with more details tonight. I've been answering by mobile so it's taking a long time to type this out. When I get home I'll update with more info soon as I get home.","I cannot actually believe that I have to say this in this thread. # Reminder: If you are the kind of human Droopy Dog that likes to accuse people of taking steroids and lying about it , because your brain, body, and genitals are small, *please* feel free to do it so that we know you should be banned to keep our community free of your type of garbage.

dmmk4m,"I have been lurking on this community for the last 5 years so I thought I would give back and share my progess/what has worked for me <3 **Tl;dr** &#x200B; * 5 Years * 175lb to 155lb **Before/After Pictures:** [https://imgur.com/DiM483L](https://imgur.com/DiM483L) &#x200B; **Stats:** *Sex*: Male *Age*: 25 *Height*: 5'9"" &#x200B; **Background:** I have been working out on and off for the last 5 years. I would go hard on my deployments then stop working out for up to a year before redeploying and getting back in the habit.  I have been hitting the gym almost every day for the last 6 months. This past winter I put on about 25lbs of fat. &#x200B; **Routine:** I've always just winged it, following this basic plan. &#x200B; * Chest / Triceps / Abs * Back / Biceps / Abs * Shoulders / Legs / Traps My favorite chest exercises: DB Flat Bench Press, DB Incline Bench Press, Dips, various forms of Cable Fly, DB Pullover, and DB closegrip press My favorite tricep exercises: Overhead tricep extensions, Close Grip Bench Press, Dips, Skullscrushers, Tricep Pushdown with a rope. My favorite back exercises: BB Row, Seated Cable Row, Seated Cable Pull Down, and pullups. Shoulders: Seated BB OHP, Seated DB shoulder press, Seated DB rotational shoulder press, Lateral Raise, Bent over rear deltoid raise. Legs: Honestly I slack in this department. I've been working on this the most the last month. I have just been using the machines my gym offers. Abs: Various machines in the gym and leg raises. **The biggest thing I can recommend here is to perfect your form**. I start with a low weight to make sure my muscles are warmed up and my form is perfect before increasing. Example for when I DB Shoulder Press: &#x200B; * 10 reps with 40lb DB * 10 reps with 50lb DB * 9 Reps with 60lb DB * 8 Reps with 65lb DB * 7 Reps with 70lb DB * 5 Reps with 75lb Db I make sure my form is perfect and I go reaaaaaal slow on the **eccentric contraction.** Look into mind-muscle connection and time under tension. Also, make sure you are breathing right. **Diet:** Again I have just been winging this part. I try my hardest to avoid sugars and processed carbs. I don't track calories or macros but will probably have to here soon. Sample day: Breakfast (If I even eat breakfast... somedays I'm in the gym at 730AM and don't eat until I get home at 1 pm): Bacon chopped up with wilted spinach, greek yogurt, banana, and/or a protein shake. Depending on how I'm feeling. Lunch: Grilled chicken. Sometimes I eat it on a toasted Hawaiian roll, sometimes I will eat it with a little bit of rice. The key for me was to just limit the carbs. Not to have it on bread+a fat serving of rice. Snack: Frozen Brussel sprouts, berries, banana, spinach, greek yogurt blended together. I never used to like vegetables but I can't even taste them. I can't recommend this enough. Snack: Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, more fruit, maybe a protein shake. Dinner: Whatever my family is cooking. Usually, fish/beef/sometimes pizza. I think the key is just not to eat junk food(e.g. Oreos, cookies, soda, candy etc.) and limit the number of processed carbs you are putting into your body. Sugar is addicting as \*\*\*\* and doesn't fill you up. I could eat half a thing of Oreos in one sitting. Chobani Flips are greek yogurt with other things to mix in. I love the Cookies & Cream or S'mores but they have a zillion flavors. This lets me get my sweet tooth itch + fills me up. **Sleep:** I used to stay up late at night on my devices, catching whatever sleep I could. I wouldn't be able to get out of bed in the morning. Now when I wake up I can't go back to sleep because I am too excited to go to the gym. Now I cut my screen time off an hour before bedtime, take a shower, meditate, and fall right asleep. I had a problem where I would wake up in the middle of the night to go pee, but I stopped drinking liquids 2 hours before bedtime. Deep sleep is really important.

I am so confident at the gym and it is bleeding over into other areas of my life. My social anxiety is gone. I have a desire to get out of bed in the morning. Don't overcomplicate this. Consistency is key. Don't be afraid to dance in the gym. It releases endorphins and the rhythm gives your brain something to focus on between sets.

dzsqml,"My grandparents are outrageously frail. They can barely walk. Zero balance. A slight gust of wind could topple them. In fact, my grandfather (who was a lifelong athlete and incredible swimmer) just fell over, broke his hip, and died.  Kinda scary. Especially since he was so athletic.  With that being said, I'm decently into weightlifting. Do you think that I would benefit from lifting in my elderly years? Would yoga be 'the thing' that keeps me agile when I'm 80? Or is it 99% genetics. I've already broken 8 bones (collar-bones, fingers, toes, arms, etc.) from sports-related injuries in my youth (snowboarding, basketball, etc.) Curious to know everyone's thoughts!","My mother and my mother-in-law are both 84. My mother-in-law is barely ambulatory. She can’t ascend stairs or get into a car unassisted. Driving is out of the question. She’s obese. Her house is filthy because she is physically unable to clean it. She has no friends and rarely leaves the house. My mother, on the other hand, is a lifelong athlete. She’s run a few Boston Marathons, and Olympic distance triathlons. She now takes zoomba classes, yoga classes, and Pilates classes. She walks daily. She goes on group bike rides. She’s socially active—she belongs to two book clubs. That these two women are the same age is mind-boggling.  I don’t think it’s genetics. It’s lifelong habits.",2533

efpwxj,"Hello, everyone. Hope you are all having a wonderful Christmas season. It is a time for family to get together as well as eat a lot of food. However, I hope everyone has been keeping fit. As usual, I've collected a few, very recent studies about fitness, health and nutrition to condense them into easy-to-read summaries for all of you. I hope to create some discussion below! Any tips for writing, presentation, analysis or anything else would be greatly appreciated. Enjoy! Squat depth is a contentious subject in the fitness literature due to its uncertainties in the context of injury risk, muscle hypertrophy, strength gains, translation into sports performance and more. The literature teeters to both ends of the spectrum as Hartmann et al. (2012) showed superior functional adaptations for the full squat when compared to shallower squats. However, more recently, Rhea et al. (2016) found that quarter squats may actually be better for improving sprinting and jumping. Thus, Pallarés et al. (2019) sought to clear up the doubt by comparing full squats, parallel squats and half squats with the following outcomes in mind: one repetition maximum, maximum propulsive velocity, jump tests, sprint tests, Wingate tests as well as physical disability measurements as a proxy for injury risk. Let’s just quickly go over what some of this means. A full squat in the context of this study is a very deep squat where the thighs meet the calves on the descent. A parallel squat is where the crease made at the groin is in line with the top of the knee. A half squat is descending until your knee joint forms a 90deg angle. The outcomes will be explained as we go along. 50 men with a squat training history were recruited and split into four groups: full squat, parallel squat, half squat and a control group. The control group obviously did not partake in any resistance training so we can see if external factors that are not being measured are at play. Training was twice a week for ten weeks and the load slowly increased from 60% to 80% of their one repetition maximum. Participants did 4–5 sets of 4–8 repetitions with four minutes of rest between sets. An interesting aspect of this study is that instead of determining one repetition maxima traditionally (lifting heavier and heavier until you cannot lift against the resistance, essentially paying attention to the load lifted), they used mean propulsive velocity which just means they measured the speed at which the bar moves and once it slows enough, we have determined the one repetition maximum. This is better because we can track objective variables and numbers here. Using this velocity-based method is valid as it was used in a study with the same lifts recently and it showed a close relationship with the traditional, load-based method (Martínez-Cava et al., 2019). Several familiarization sessions were done to learn the exercises before the ten week training programme began. The full squat group saw improvements across all outcomes. They increased their one repetition maximum in all three types of squats. They had better sprints and jumps as well as better Wingate test results. The wingate test is essentially a test for power (work done over time) on a cycling machine. The parallel squat group had similar results to the full squat group though to smaller extents. The half squat group made did not make great strength gains even for the half squat one repetition maximum. The power hardly changed and the peak power actually decreased. Jump heights improved slightly however, the sprint times were unchanged. The half squat group actually saw the worst results when it came to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a series of likert scales (ratings of subjective feeling) initially used in hospitals to evaluate pain, stiffness and functional disability in osteoarthritis (joint degeneration, generally in knees, hips and hands) patients, however, it has been used for a wide variety of rheumatological disorders. The half squat group saw large increases in all variables measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, unlike the other groups. Deeper squats may not have an increased knee injury risk despite higher knee flexion angles because of various reasons. The wrapping effect is a mechanism in which the quadriceps tendon makes better contact with the femur as we descend further in the squat rendering the knee joint more stable. The soft-tissue contact between the calf and the thigh in a deep squat may also provide support (Hartmann, Wirth & Klusemann, 2013). Like previous studies, there was a degree of specificity that came to light. Groups made the best strength gains at the depth they trained at. However, the full squat group still made better strength gains in the half squat if we make group to group comparisons. Another point to note is that the control group had several decrements in performance due to detraining. This further reinforces the idea that the trained population will suffer in performance after extended periods of sedentary lifestyle. **TL;DR:** The deeper you go in a squat, the better your outcomes (strength, sprints, power, jumping) and this is likely without an increased risk for injury. (Reminder that this study was only done in trained men so keep that mind with application to populations). ———————————- Flexion of the lumbar spine (basically the spine segment located in the lower back) has long been thought to be associated with lower back pain. This has led to interventions in occupational health (“proper” biomechanics and use of braces) as well as in the fitness world especially in exercises such as the deadlift. However, is the association at hand really as strong as we think? Saraceni et al. (2019) very recently conducted a meta-analysis (pooling studies together) / review on the literature regarding this very question. They specifically aimed to see i) if lumbar flexion is a risk factor for lower back pain and ii) if the degree of lumbar flexion is different between those with or without lower back pain. In total, they managed to gather 12 studies with a total of 697 participants for analysis. Overall, the quality of evidence was deemed to be low, however, there was no evidence to suggest that lumbar flexion was a risk factor for lower back pain though lumbar load may be a risk factor. To quote: *“Critically, to date no study that has directly measured the lumbar spine during lifting, has found a relationship between LBP and greater lumbar flexion”* People with lower back pain, on average, actually flexed slightly less at the lumbar spine when lifting. Unfortunately, this finding was clouded in heterogeneity which means that the papers that were pooled together in analysis were conducted so differently from each other that it becomes difficult to put them together. This finding may also be a result of reverse causality i.e: people with lower back pain flex less because of the pain, not the other way around. Careful applications of this study into resistance training world must be done as the maximum load of all the studies included was 12 kilograms. **TL;DR:** No evidence to suggest a relationship between the degree of lumbar flexion and low back pain. -——————- Blood flow restriction training is gaining more traction in the training world as more and more studies appreciate its efficacy. It is executed by partially occluding the targeted muscle(s)’ blood supply (via tourniquet or other means) and training with this occlusion. It has its place in recreational training as well as in rehabilitation as it allows healing joints/tissues to exercise with lighter loads while still reaping the benefits you would receive from higher loads. An important aspect to consider, however, is the effect of blood flow restriction training on the tendons involved. This is critical because if muscle adapts to a greater extent then its tendons do, an imbalance between the structures may lead to injury. Centner et al. (2019) took 38 untrained men and separated them into three groups: a group that trained with 70–85% of one repetition maximum loads with normal resistance training, a group with 20–35% of one repetition maximum loads with blood flow restricted training and one control group. The training groups followed their respective exercise programmes for 14 weeks. The traditional resistance training group did three sets of standing calf raises and three sets of sitting calf raises with 6–12 repetitions each. For the other group, the scheme was similar but one set of 30 repetitions was done before each exercise so in total eight sets would be done as opposed to six in the other group. 15 repetitions were done for the rest of the sets. The pressure used was set at a 50% occlusion and was kept on between sets but not between exercises. Training was held three times per week. After 14 weeks, the achilles tendon (the tendon which joins the calf muscle to the ankle) cross-sectional area grew similarly between training groups. The same can be said about gastrocnemius (calf muscle) cross-sectional area, muscle stiffness and maximum voluntary torque (force produced by calf muscle). Young’s modulus changes (stress divided by strain, a property that tells us the stiffness of a material) was said to be statistically insignificant between and within groups though the high load training group had an increased Young’s modulus while the blood flow restricted group’s had decreased. Increases in stiffness are likely because of the increased size of the tendon rather than any changes in the material properties of the tendon. The tendon adaptations we find in the blood flow restricted group may be explained by the theory of metabolic stress inducing an increased production of fibroblasts, a cell which supports a tendon’s integrity by synthesizing collagen and other structural proteins. A valuable part of the study that is missing is another group that trains with low loads but without blood flow occlusion as that would help isolate the variable of blood flow occlusion from other variables such as load. Another limitation that the authors highlighted was that the method of measuring tendon cross-sectional changes (via ultrasound) is not the most accurate technique especially when compared to sensitive procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). **TL;DR:** Positive tendon adaptations still occur in those who do blood flow restricted training (for young, untrained men). -——————- Over the years, we have begun to realize that muscle hypertrophy does not require as much as we thought for it to occur. Low volumes, low frequencies, low repetitions, high rest — they all seem to work. Even intensities as low as 30% of your 1 repetition maximum are enough to induce hypertrophy (Mitchell et al., 2012). Can the same be said about muscle strength? Androulakis‑Korakakis, Fisher & Steele (2019) performed a meta-analysis and review on the subject amassing six different studies total. It was found that volume as low as one set of 8–10 repetitions per week for 10 weeks was enough for muscle strength to increase. All sets in the studies were done to muscle failure. Most studies had some form of progression between training sessions. Loads were generally within the 70–90% 1 repetition maximum range so if strength changes can reliably occur at lower loads (<60% 1 repetition maximum) is a question that still has yet to be answered. This point may be moot from an efficiency standpoint as working with lower loads would require higher repetitions to failure thus taking up more time. We also do not know if we can get significant strength gains at repetitions lower than five to six assuming while still maintaining a frequency of one set per week. Furthermore, these findings are limited to the squat and bench press only, the deadlift unfortunately does not have enough research to make any concrete statements. Most of this data was gleaned from trained athletes, however, while they were technically “resistance-trained”, their personal records and training history would only be considered to be at an intermediate level from an advanced perspective. Despite having few studies to work with, all the studies were of high methodological quality. One final limitation is that these results can only be extrapolated to males. The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range). **TL;DR:** ""The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).” -———————— With bodybuilding, it is often recommended to eat at a caloric surplus (ie. eating more calories than you burn daily) while training. This is sound advice because your body does need more energy for building the new tissue, maintaining the tissue and dealing with the altered metabolism that the body undergoes with training and muscle tissue accretion. However, there are a lot more variables that go into this and there is an immense amount of nuance. Slater et al. (2019) aimed to present and discuss all the variables as well as unravel all the confusion. Do we need a surplus in the first place? It would seem so given the theory above. Energy restrictions have been shown to interfere with muscle protein synthesis but this can be alleviated with training and a higher protein intake. So it is likely still possible to experience hypertrophy in a caloric deficit but this is probably only reasonably applicable to the overweight or untrained (more research needed!). Despite eating a caloric surplus being ubiquitous as a guideline, it is interesting to note that there is no controlled trial where they studied the relationship between a caloric surplus and muscle hypertrophy from resistance training over an extended period of time. However, we can look at overfeeding studies where participants are eating at a caloric surplus while not resistance training. In these studies, we do see gains in fat-free mass. There are mathematical formulae out there to calculate what is the ideal surplus for your hypertrophy goals, however, no formulae takes into account all the complex biological processes that occur with muscle hypertrophy. These formulae are also based off of people who do not resistance train. Metabolism can be vastly different in athletes. For example, diet-induced thermogenesis (heat produced/calories burnt simply from eating) can be higher for athletes as their protein intakes are generally higher (takes more energy to digest protein). There is also the question of how you should distribute the surplus throughout the day or week. For example, carbohydrates may be good before or during high volume training yet there is no strong research in that area. Another common example is having a larger surplus on training days to make up for the training. The macronutrient distribution of the surplus is also relevant. The authors recommend 4–7 g/kg/day of carbohydrates, 35% of caloric intake with fat and 1.6 g/kg/day of protein. Three meals spread across the day with snacks interspersed between also appears to be effective. In total, a 360–480 daily calorie surplus seems to be an appropriate number to start with but it requires constant review throughout the training programme. **TL;DR:** Not a lot is known about a caloric surplus and its effects on muscle hypertrophy while training. However, a small surplus of 360–480 kcal/day with appropriate macronutrient distribution appears to be a good starting point for most people wanting to build muscle. -————————— Androulakis-Korakakis, P., Fisher, J.

I merged the two in MS paint, so I'm guessing that's where the white outline came from. Here's the unmerged pic: https://imgur.com/a/6oBtj3O &#x200B; **BACKSTORY** About 4 months ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/crve01/5_months_without_lifting_about_to_get_back_into/) in this subreddit asking for some advice on how to best get back into a lifting routine without being completely destroyed by debilitating soreness the next day. Suffice it to say, the advice was incredibly helpful & I wasn't TOO sore after my first few days back (at least not as bad as I expected). So, many thanks to this community, you guys are super knowledgeable! Well, much to my surprise, since that post I've actually been able to make going to the gym a habit. After many years of stopping & going, while never being able to consistently make it a habit, I've finally done it boys. This may not seem like a big deal, but if you knew the true extent of my inherent laziness & overall inclination for procrastination, you would understand. Since the first day I started (8-19-19), I've gone 6 days a week and have yet to miss a day. I'm wrapping up week 19 now. Honestly, I feel freaking great. I'm a bit bummed I didn't do this sooner. But oh well, I'm happy with the results thus far, and while I still have a long way to go, I'm more motivated than ever. For me, the secret that enabled me to finally make it habitual ended up being quite simple actually. Before, whenever I'd try to get into a long term workout routine, I was never able to stick with it primarily because after work I'd want to do nothing more than come home & lay around (the laziness I was talking about). It was very hard to force myself to go to the gym. Well, this time around I decided to go to the gym BEFORE work. Here's the thing though. I work 6 days a week starting at 8:00 AM. This is NOT going to be easy. Or so I thought. Turns out, it was ALOT easier. For one, I basically gave myself a rule that if I go into work that day, I MUST go to the gym before hand. It's a mandatory prerequisite. No gym, no work, and vice versa. I fail to go to the gym, I don't work that day which gets me in trouble at work (funny how when you create additional consequences for yourself, motivation seems to MAGICALLY appear). Plus, it solves two problems. One, I get my workout done for the day & still get to go home after work and be as lazy as my heart desires. Two, I no longer need to drink energy drinks to start my day because I feel very mentally focused & full of energy after a workout (much more so than an energy drink would give me). Being that I work in sales, mental clarity is a necessity, and working out before work ensures I will have this mental clarity 100% of the time. So for anybody struggling to stick to a schedule, I highly recommend going before work. The hardest part about it was simply getting started. After day 1, honestly, sticking with it was cake. &#x200B; **ROUTINE** I've been doing the [PHUL routine](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout) for the entire run so far. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday are the lifting days. I do cardio (30 mins on elliptical) and abs on Wednesdays and Sundays. I do about 10 minutes of stretching & 10 minutes on the elliptical before every workout. Here's the progression of each main lift thus far (I'm using the app called ""Zero to Hero"" for tracking): * [Bench Press](https://imgur.com/a/BxIZ7AX) * [Squat](https://imgur.com/a/0sW7F4C) * [Deadlift](https://imgur.com/a/dVhHNVv) For lift progression, I'll only move up in weight by 5 lbs once I'm able to hit the max reps & sets for that lift. For example, I'll try incline DB bench press for 4 sets of 12 with 65 lb dumbbells. If I only do 3 sets of 12 and 1 set of 11, I'll try that same weight again the next week. I'll do this until I hit 4x12, then the following week I'll move up to 70 lb dumbbells. Etc. However I don't do this with EVERY lift though. Things like barbell curls, lateral raises, etc. I'll often stick with the same reps and sets at a certain weight for many weeks before deciding to move up in weight. &#x200B; **DIET** As far as diet, admittedly I'm not following a hardcore diet routine. I'm just being more aware of what I'm eating & trying to limit the bad stuff. For breakfast, I eat 2 packets of oatmeal (maple and brown sugar MMMM) and mix a scoop of 25g of protein in it. After my workout, I'll drink a 50g protein shake mixed with a scoop of Field of Greens. For lunch, I started using a food delivery service that delivers to my office. Each meal is 500 calories, and has roughly 50g of protein, 30g of carbs, and 15g or so of fats. For dinner I TRY to eat healthy for the most part, although that doesn't always go according to plan. I'll shoot for grilled chicken, veggies, and potatoes or rice or something. Although some nights I'll have a big heaping plate of spaghetti, or snag me a guacamole burrito from Del Taco. Or a California burrito from Rubios. Yummmm. I figure that if I eat healthy for the first two meals of the day then it's okay to screw around for dinner every now and again. I've cut out sweets almost entirely. Well, sometimes on Saturdays I'll have a cookie or two but that's IT. Saturdays I'll basically eat what I want, but I do make sure to keep the calories to a minimum, as it's my only rest day. At the end of the day, the most important thing to me when it comes to a diet routine is doing something I can stick with LONG TERM, if not indefinitely. My current routine meets those requirements; I'm actually able to stick with it quite easily. I just hope it's sufficient to get the results I want & that I won't have to further limit myself. Only time will tell! &#x200B; So there's where I'm at after almost 19 weeks. While I'm nowhere near my end goal in terms of physique, I'm in the best shape of my life and I feel great. Most importantly, I'm in a routine that I'm 100% certain I can stick with indefinitely. Now, I'm just not sure what to do next. I feel like I'm starting to plateau on my lifts (bench and squat). I'm not sure if it's because I need to consume more calories (I hope not as I'm trying to burn fat), if I need to change my workout routine, or if progression just happens at a much slower rate after the first couple months. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!","Very nice! One of the best things about fitness is that once you maintain the routine for a month, it can become self-sustaining because you simply feel better each and every day. Fitness is its own reward. Do everything you can to maintain your schedule. I know from both personal experience (and from friends’ experience) that dropping out for a week can be devastating for progress. Treat it like a job, with minimum hours per week, and you have to punch the clock.",319
eiitza,"**Photos:** [Before and After](https://imgur.com/a/eo9180J) [Body](https://imgur.com/a/Wp4GNc0) [Face](https://imgur.com/a/101fuH6) **Weight:** ~350 lbs -> 227.4lbs **Diet:** Diet was pretty much just portion control. Eating a lot of the things I still liked at first but at a lower amount than before. I tried my hardest to keep around 1500 calories a day. Pretty much what I did was I found a TDEE calculator, and cut my basal metabolic rate in half and ate that much. My diet was pretty much exclusively Chicken breast, microwave mixed vegetables, peanut butter sandwiches, apples, and protein shakes.  I am still pretty bad when it comes to eating healthy, making it a bit harder to lose the last 15-20 lbs I want to lose, but I'm getting better at it every day. **Lifting Program:** In the beginning I stuck to the pretty simple Push, Pull, Legs program. Tried to do my best by doing 5x5 on compound lifts, and just 4x10 on everything else. After a while I started to modify my lifting program, and started doing Chest/Triceps, Back/Biceps, Chest/Shoulders, Legs. I also moved to higher volume, lower weight on back and bicep day (especially biceps), and vice versa on Chest day. Here is my current Program **Chest/Tricep:** 5x5:  Bench Incline Bench 4x8: Incline Dumbbell Bench Chest Press Fly Machine  Tricep Pushdown   Tricep Pulldown   Skull Crushers  Squeeze Press One Arm Tricep Pulldowns **Back/Bicep:** 4x10:  Bent Over Rows Barbell Shrugs 3x15: Dumbbell Hammer Curl Preacher Curl Barbell Curl Incline Dumbbell Curls Dumbbell Row Cable Pulldown Cable Row Assisted Pull up **Chest/Shoulders:** 5x5:  Bench OHP (usually try and pyramid up to a max for OHP, helps with my shoulder development) 4x10: Incline Dumbbell Bench Chest Press Fly Machine  Lateral Raises Arnold Press Reverse Dumbbell Fly Reverse Fly Machine Face Pull Lateral Cable Raises  **Leg:** 5x5: Squat  Deadlift (Conventional or Sumo, depends on how im feeling) 4x10: Hamstring curls Leg Extension (low weight usually) Abduction Machine Adduction Machine Leg Press Calf Raises **Core:** Usually throw in 2 quick core exercises at the end of each day **Cardio:** I Bike everywhere at school (in College currently), but I also occasionally do Boxing, Jumprope, and Running.  **Lift Progression:** Bench: 115 -> 195 (1 Rep Max) Overhead Press: 65 -> 115 (1 Rep Max) Deadlift: 225 -> 335 (1 Rep Max) Squat: 135 -> 225 (5x5) **How I got Fat:**  My family has always been fairly unhealthy. While I was encouraged to do sports when I was younger, it fell off pretty hard when I got into middle/highschool. From 7th to 8th grade I gained around 60 lbs, and when I was a freshman in highschool I weighed 300lbs. I ended up doing some weightlifting in Highschool for a Physical Education credit, but ended up stopping half way through. I spent most of my days just playing video games, and eating all I wanted. This eventually lead to me weighing about 350 lbs during my Highschool Graduation. My Graduation Gown was so tight on me I couldn’t even sit down with it zipped up. When I got to college, my eating habits continued. While I was more active walking around campus, I had an all you can eat meal plan, and boy did I use it. Between eating large pizzas at least 3 times a week, eating full tubs of Ben and Jerry's ice cream daily, and nightly Subway runs, I maintained my weight of 350 lbs throughout my first year of college.  **How I got Fit:** While I had done some moderate lifting earlier on in 2019, it wasn't until after my 20th Birthday, that I decided to go all in. I was sick of being fat, and I finally accepted how much I hated my body. In early April I decided to start my diet and exercise routine and finally take it seriously. With the semester ended, I had a ridiculous amount of time to exercise, and I took advantage of my Universities gyms. Just trying to wake up every day and go was a bit of a hassle at first, but I stuck with it. Slowly I began to see a difference on the scale, where I would drop around 10 lbs a week for my first month. While this amount of weight loss does sound massively unhealthy, I think it was mostly a product of the amount I was eating before. Before dieting I was most likely eating upwards of 5000 Calories a day, and cutting it down to 1500 was hard, but made me drop weight like crazy. By the end of the summer, after about 4 months of Dieting and Exercise, I was finally down to about 260lbs. As school started up again, I ended up seeing most of my friends who freaked out when seeing the fact that I dropped 80-90lbs over summer. After that I continued my diet/exercise, and eventually dropped down to where I am at now, 227.4 lbs. While during the Fall semester I did cheat on my meals a lot, drank a good amount, and overall didn't stick to my diet, I was really happy I remained active and didn’t bounce back with my weight.   **Future goals:** My Goal Weight is 205, and I want to hit that preferably in the first quarter of 2020. A big one is also benching 225 for the first time, which hopefully will happen very soon. As for this year, I hope to be able to increase all my compound lifts by 100 lbs (I know its a lofty goal, but aim high hit low) by the end of 2020. **Improvements Outside of the Gym:** As for outside of the gym, my life has changed pretty drastically. All the posts on reddit saying that people treat you differently when you are a more natural weight is true. People treat me better, and it has made me so much more comfortable in my own skin. I feel like i'm much more outgoing now, and it has improved my happiness quite a bit. I even ended up dating the girl i've had a huge crush on for the past year and a half, which is pretty crazy in its own right.  It's never too late to start losing weight. I thought I was fucked because of how heavy I was, and that I’d never be able to commit. I finally did, and it was the greatest decision of my life. If you are viewing this on New Years for encouragement, please go through with it. It will be the best thing you’ve ever done for yourself.  Happy New Years!",Well done mate. You're an inspiration.,441
eq2oc2,"Hi Reddit, my first post ever on here so please bare with. Male - 22 - 6'2.5 (190cm) - 100kg(\~220lbs) [BEFORE (ples dont mind my ugly face)](https://imgur.com/a/RpuCLCi) [AFTER](https://imgur.com/a/7I5LMx3) **Intro** Firstly, i've never been bothered about how my body looked, and no one really said anything against how I looked, however, it was always about my strength. I went to a boy school so things got physical there, and my strength was challenged a lot; so much so that people were surprised if I lifted something fairly heavy. So being strong was my aim. I was always active and played football, cycling and jogging a lot, but little to no weight lifting. I was 18 when I started, which was the year I was going to University, I specifically waited for this year as I would have more free time and be more independent in what I ate and how I lived my life. I lived at my uni campus (2 hour drive away from home). **2016-2017 - Skinny Noodle** With little to no research - I started a ""bro split""kinda work out (I hit each body part once a week). I thought I was strong, and to be fair I think I was. I was benching around 50kg for 6/7 reps during the end of 2016. My back was definitely strong (through back rowing, one arm row, pull ups -6reps ). The highest I could deadlift was 90kg. I tried to DL 100kg in front of my uni mates and I kid you not, I nearly passed out. My diet in 2016 - 2017 was appalling now looking back. I did not track my calories until 6/7 months after I started gym. It was definitely below the recommended. And I ate a lot of processed food. I started my first cut 6/7 months in as I just wanted to look like I had muscle, which was a mistake. My main foods consisted  of: * Eggs * chicken * meatballs * green veg * porridge (with a scoop of mass gainer ) * wholemeal bread In conclusion, 2016 was a massive learning curve for me, spent countless nights watching YouTube videos, researching how the body works, and meals which guaranteed the best gains. Weighed 78kg **2017-2018 - The year of the vicious bulk** After around a year of going through mistakes in mainly my diet; I started to find out what works well for my body, the best routines etc. Major changes I made was body split to PPL(push pull legs). Followed a 5x5 type training. Removed all processed foods apart from shakes. And now incorporated fruit smoothies with a scoop of whey. NOW LET THE BULK BEGIN (6+ month bulk) Followed a strict PPL. 5 days a week > 2 rest. Then the following week, 6 days a week > 1 rest. Repeat. I ate 5 meals a day : * Weetabix with peanut butter * Wholemeal bread with eggs * Wholemeal bread, ham and cheese ""toastie"". * Fruit smoothie with 1 or 2 scoops of whey * Rice/Pasta with chicken/tuna and veg I was easily eating around 3300cal a day. Going to the gym 5/6 times a week for months. Slept 8+ hours a day, except the days we went clubbing. **Until...** I was incredibly fatigued for at least 5 days. My body was in so much pain and it hurt to even walk long distance, my muscles wanted to retire. I crashed bad; and that is when I found out that you're supposed to take a week break around every 3 months. My exercises exploded as I was on this bulk - Benched 90kg for 5 reps, squat - 110kg for 5 reps, barbell rows - 60kg. I had to say bye to pull ups as my additional fat made it harder to lift my body weight. Moreover, I barely trained my arms compared to chest for some reason, so I plateaued. In conclusion - people noticed how strong I was getting, and I had a few compliments of my  transformation compared to the previous year. Weighed 90kg **2018 - 2019/20 - Ultimate comeback** At this point I was well aware of what I was doing in the gym. I knew/know near enough all there is to bodybuilding, and it was just a case of being patient and making sure I met my macros. At this point I had just gone through a cut and I looked shredded than i've ever been. Was even surprised at the veins I had on my abs, but all i wanted to do was to be strong so I went on a soft bulk; 100cal above maintenance and some days just ate maintenance but made sure I had enough protein and fats. Rotated between 4x6 training an 8x3 training around every 2/3 months. My lifts towards the end of the year were: * Bench Press - 100kg for 5 * Barbell Row - 90kg for 8 * Deadlift - 210kg for 2 * Squats - 150kg for 5 * OHP 50kg for 8 My diet stayed pretty much the same. 5 Meals a day: * 2 \* Fruit smoothie with whey (\~500cal each) * Rice and tuna * Peanut butter jelly (for the fats ;) * Dinner In conclusion - ""we're in the end game now"". Weighed 100kg **What I've learned (positives and negatives)** * Compound movements are the biggest priorty * Diet before anything - your body reacts to it sooooo easily * Rest is very very important * CONSISTENCY * You actually grow when you're not going to the gym, so your body can finally rebuild what has been teared. * I sweat so easily it's annoying. **Next goals** * 105kg * Bigger calves (the bane of my life) * Better cardiovascular health Thank you for reading if you did; if you made it through the end- here's a [COOKIE](https://imgur.com/a/UgaJPzq) &#x200B; EDIT: this is a [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U35wa6McMK-hXHMOkociaMVxKc_ZcnWH/view?usp=sharing) I made  to help myself, sharing this might also help others :) EDIT 2: 2018 [picture](https://imgur.com/a/PTHTMAd) progress (90kg)",Samuel L's Jacked Son,568

I need to work on my bench press. I started with light weights making sure my form was on point and when i felt comfortable i started adding weight. I’m on my last phase of my lean bulk and will be starting my cut next month.   Diet: My diet consist of high protein, moderate carbs and fats. I usually eat oats and protein shake for breakfast, grilled chicken breast or tuna + veggies and rice for my 2nd and 3rd meal and i like to eat protein bars as a snack. Also having enough sleep is a key to success as it helps in muscle recovery.  Thoughts: To be honest, the hardest thing about working out is not knowing when to start. From my experience, the best time to start is now. And if you stay commited and consistent you will reach your goal. I would like to thank you guys for inspiring me and for helping me reach the best version of my self. Cheers!!!","Dang! 6 months! Have you hit your goals? If so, do you have any new ones?",179
ewbmbq,"I am 6' 2"", male, 30 years old Been struggling with my weight, physical capabilities and image for nearly a decade and finally got over the consistency hump and have been thrilled with my latest progress. Starting weight: 275 lbs Current weight: 204 lbs Progress pictures:  [https://imgur.com/38GnagP](https://imgur.com/38GnagP) Strength stats (Squat / Deadlift / Bench in lbs): Start:  165 / 245 / 145 Current:  315 / 375 / 235 **Phase 1 - Raw weight loss and learning my limits, first 3 months (April 2019 through end of June 2019)** * Diet:  I focused on portion and calorie control.  I targeted 1800 calories (a 500 calories deficit from TDEE) and a 35/35/30 protein/fat/carb macro split.  I wanted to get carbs under control while still maintaining enough energy to exercise.  The deficit was rough to begin with but I wanted to be aggressive in trimming down my body fat. * Exercise:    * First 3 weeks:  Nothing revolutionary here.  30 minutes of elliptical, medium resistance, focused on keeping my HR above 160.  I would follow up with 3 sets of push ups (10-12 reps) and 3 sets of air squats (20 reps)    * Remainder of Phase 1:  I went with a 4 day bro split with most exercises in the RPE 6-7 range.       * Monday: Chest and Triceps:  Dumbbell Bench 3x10, Skullcrushers 3x12, Incline Benchpress 3x8, Cable Tricep Pushdown 4x15, Cable Chest Fly 3x15.  Wanted to stick to basics here and create a good foundation around my very tender left shoulder (which would haunt me for the next 6 months until I was diagnosed with mild thoracic outlet syndrome).       * Tuesday:  Legs:  Back Squat 5x5, RDLs 3 x10, Leg Extensions 4 x10 superset with Seated Leg Curls 4x10, Calf Raises 3x20.  I knew my bench would be my weakest mainlift based on my previous failures of working out consistently but I was not prepared for how terrible my back squat would feel. I did grind through 5x5 to build strength which I was moderately successful but my set up was always random until later in my progression.       * Wednesday:  Rest       * Thursday:  Back and Biceps:  Conventional Deadlifts 3x5, Cable or Landmine Rows 3x8, Lat Pulldowns 4x10, Dumbbell Bicep Curls 3x12, EZ Bar Preacher 3x8, Dumbbel Hammer Curls 3x10.  Deadlifts felt too good early on,  pulled my back about 6 weeks in and had to rehab with a chiropractor for 6 weeks after that.  I was able to still lift lightly around the tenderness but hated I let my ego control the weight instead of logic.  My biceps and lats were also grossly underdeveloped.  My biceps weren't a huge focus but I knew I needed stronger lats to progress.  I was majorly intimidated by pull ups and chin ups and avoided them for FAR too long because of my weight and left shoulder. I'll address this more in Phase 2.       * Friday: Shoulders:  Dumbdell Shoulder Press 3x8, Arnold Presses 3x10, Seated Face Pulls 4x12, Rear Delt Flys 3x12, Cable Lateral Raises 4x15.  I was FAR too aggressive early in this phase.  I cannot stress to new lifters how crucial shoulder health is to making strength progress.  Not until my final month of Phase 1 did drop most of my weights so I could complete my full rep ranges.  Cable lateral raises to this day I do still find incredibly valuable both functionally and aesthetically.       * Saturday: Rest       * Sunday:  Active Recovery:  This would include anything from a 30 min swim to 20 min max incline walking on treadmills to 30 min sprint on the elliptical.  I was often very very sore still and wanted to create some healthy blood flow without completely taxing my body. * Ending Phase 1 Stats:    * Weight: 245 lbs    * Squat / Deadlift / Bench:  205 / 285 / 170 * Overall reflection on Phase 1:  What I felt I did well:  Diet - I cut out booze and most processed foods, my bloating was erased and my skin health was like a 180 from the past 5 years of my life.  My energy levels were also much more consistent.  What I didn't do well with:  ego lifting and learning form before adding weight - I wish I had spent more time watching and learning proper form and movements.  I felt I left a lot of growth on the table but that's part of learning. **Phase 2: New gym, PPL and proper recovery (July 2019 to Jan 2020/Present)** * Diet:  My biggest contrast to my phase dieting was staying in smaller caloric deficit (I eat around 2200 calories now) and increasing protein intake to match the 6 day PPL split I was about to undertake.  My macros were (and still are) closer to 43/30/27 protein/fat/carbs.  My split is pretty damn demanding on my body and I knew going into a 6 day split that without inter-week rest days, I was going to need a surplus of protein to recover properly.  I focused on baked chicken, haddock, salmon, whey protein and occasionally pork as my main sources.  I target around 220g a day. * Exercise:    * My programming is loosely based off Jeff Nippard's Push, Pull, Legs Hypertrophy Program.  I find Jeff to be calm, researched and delivers great content to follow along with.  My primary focus in this phase was walking a line between powerlifting and bodybuilding - so as you will see my major deviation from his program was sticking closer to a 5x5 split on my compound lifts.  I also ran this program as Legs, Push, Pull, Legs, Push, Pull, Rest.  I also moved to a new gym with a lot of experienced but friendly lifters that have helped me tremendously.  Don't be scared to ask - 99% of people are willing to help you.    * As an overarching theme to my split, my first three days of the split are focused on strength (65 to 85% 1RM) and my second three days are focused on speed and form (45 to 65% 1RM)    * Legs - Monday, Strength Day & Thursday, Speed Day       * Back Squat:  Alternating between 60% 5x5 and 80% 5x3 week to week.  After a lot of research, mobility work in my hips and help from folks in the gym, my set up and execution of my back squat really progressed (esp in the last 2-2.5 months).  Back squats are my favorite movement with deadlifts being a close 2nd.       * Conventional Deadlifts:  On 5x5 squat weeks, I will deadlift for 3x8 at 50%.  On 5x3 squat weeks, I move deadlifts to my first movement on pull days at 4x4 at 75-85%.  Coupled with back squats - these two movements hit anything and everything legs.       * Bulgarian Split Squats & Raised Heel Air Squats:  Body weight only 3x10 sets on each movement, super set.  By now, my hips and CNS are pretty worn so I focus clean, clean form with these two movements.  These both helped isolate my stabilizers for keeping the descent of my squat in control.  Raised heel = 15 lb bumper plate under your heels and your toes pointed out roughly 30 degrees.       * Leg Extensions / Lying Leg Curls / Seated Calf Raises:   Core accessory lifts for aesthetics and strength.  I would do a giant super set with all three movements, 3x12 for each.       * Speed Day Modifications:  I add a 3x10 of safety squat bar good mornings as they help my squat and deadlift out of hole strength a TON.  I also replace lying leg curls with 3x10 Rogue reverse hyper extensions.    * Push: Tuesday, Strength Day & Friday, Speed Day       * Benchpress w/ Football Bar:  4x6 or 5x3, alternating week to week.  This bar worked wonders for me while I was remedying my thoracic outlet issues.  It allowed me to progressively overload without creating tons of stress on my left elbow and shoulders.  It also did a great job of creating a natural bar path for when I actually do barbell bench.       * Starting Strength Lying Tricep Extensions: 4x10, Mark Rippetoe's version of this movement is insanely good for upper chest and tricep development.  One of my favorites I discovered 1/2 way through Phase 2 and what a difference maker it has been.       * High Incline Shoulder/Chest Press:  3x8, I place the bench around 60 degrees and keep the dumbbells parallel to each other.  Took me a long while to overload these but once my shoulder felt 100% - I have been able to increase 5 lbs/every other week for the last 12 weeks.  Highly encouraging.       * Dips:  3 sets to failure.  Still working on improving these but they seem to translate well to my bench form.       * Double Rope Cable Tricep Pull? Downs:  4x10, a John Meadows movement, take a quick search on Youtube for his technique here.  Nothing better for a tricep pump.       * Cable Ez Curl Bar Reverse Grip Push Downs: 4x12, Long name but great way to hit a different angle (especially with the reverse grip) on your triceps.       * Cable Flys:  1 Massive Drop Set (Usually around 40-50 reps),  I will start with a weight that I can complete 10 reps for, drop to a weight I can complete another 10, etc.       * Speed Day Modifications:  I replace high incline shoulder presses with lighter 30 degrees 3x12 incline dumbbell press.  I also do not do dips on speed days.    * Pull:  Wednesday, Strength Day & Saturday, Speed Day       * Deadlifts:  As stated in the leg portion, these ended on either pull day or leg day.  When they end up on pull day, I like 4 sets of heavy triples.  I find my 5th set is generally very diminished.       * Pull Ups & Chin Ups (alternate set to set):  4x10,  I am still using a blue band here so I can truly focus of slow descents and precise control.  Only got confidence to start doing these 6 weeks ago but they have already reshaped my back and lats.       * Hammersmith Low Row:  3x8, alternating reps per arm.  Really enjoy these over bent over dumbbell rows.  Far more isolated.       * Lat Pulldown/Hammersmith High Row:  3x10,  good plain ol' lat pulldowns I feel should be in any body building or power lifting regimen.       * Barbell Curls: 3x8,  I focus on keeping my shoulders locked and down, no shrugging.       * Incline Lying Barbell Drag Curls:  3x12, Superset with curls.  I use the same weight from barbell curls, lay chest down on an incline bench and focus on squeezing my hands pulling with my elbows.  Has really helped create mass in my biceps.       * Speed Day Modifications:  I add Cable Rows with fat grip individual handles, 3x15 - awesome for grip and forearm strength too.  I also add a random forearm exercise to help round out my arms.    * Sunday: Recovery       * Yoga, Yoga, Yoga:  I don't do anything fancy but very simple movements I find on the DoYogaWithMe Youtube Channel.  Absolutely critical for keeping my mobility high and form aligned. My next steps are to cut down to 190 by April 1st for my full ""1 year transformation"" and hopefully get myself a set of abs for the first time in my adult life.  From there, my focus for the remainder of the year is on maintaining my physique and gaining strength.  I would like a 1000 lb total by September of this year. Thanks for reading and any feedback and greatly appreciated! EDIT:  Holy crap everyone (especially to the platinum and gold folks)! Thank you for all the kind words, it's def helping fuel that final push. Side note - coincidentally 90% of progress pics are from when my hair is longest lol, 99% of the time it's trimmed to #1.  I do have 2 tiny benign cysts being removed from the back of head next month so I can finally go back to shaving my head without spending 90 min doing so haha.",Dad Bod to Daddy,374
ezdecy,"**\[M / 32 / 5’10” / 165-190-170\]** **TL;DR**   Busy dad of three small kids makes moderate progress during one year of focusing on consistency, hitting a 208-workout streak. I ran nSuns’ 531LP 4-day routine, did a decent job of bulking and cutting, and didn’t sleep nearly enough. Edit: thanks for the support, guys! It's awesome to hear from so many of you. And for the gold,  [Before/after pics](https://imgur.com/a/zyHxgOO) [Bonus post-bulk chonk pic @ 190](https://imgur.com/a/ZOKEtrO) [Typical training log](https://imgur.com/a/TdIJ0AY) &#x200B; |**Lifts**|**Starting\***|**Current\***|**1RM**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Bench Press|110|145|185| |Squat|130|235|275| |Deadlift|170|255|315| |Overhead Press|50|75|115| *\*I’m giving these as the heaviest set in my weekly routine rather than just a 1RM or TM. I feel it’s more representative of the work I actually put in and reflects how much I deloaded at the start of the year.* **Streaking**   I’m putting this at the top because it’s been the key to my results over the last year. [This is the most important progress pic of all](https://imgur.com/a/K2f9Ila), my 2019 and 2020 calendars. Every day I complete a workout I highlight it on the calendar (deloads are blue), and I can’t believe how motivating just crossing the day off has been. That tiny act gave me the motivation to start a streak long enough to develop the discipline to keep going through family challenges, frequent work travel, nagging aches and pains, and several bouts of illness. Every day I don’t feel like working out I’m not just asking myself, “Do I feel like working out today?” It’s “Does the streak end today?” The answer is no. Most dedication: our whole family was coming down with stomach flu, so before the nausea got too bad I got my ass downstairs and did Squat Day before spending the night vomiting. Streak preserved! Closest call: one week in December dealing with aches and pains, holiday stress, generally poor mental health and family conflict, I ended up deloading my last two workouts of the week, cutting a lot of the accessories, and doing them both on the last day of the week. **Background**   My fitness journey from 2003 until late 2016 consisted mainly of semi-consistent running with periodic spells of messing around with bodyweight exercises in the gym. I’ve always been a fairly active person – my friends would call me “fit” – but I never really focused on one thing with enough consistency to see substantial results, nor did I really know what results I was looking for. From track and cross country in high school to several years of trail running, I found my way to lifting in late 2016 because I wanted to improve my core strength and stability on long training runs. Late 2016 through March 2018 was my true beginner period. I ran StrongLifts 5x5 for four months, starting with the bar and eventually transitioning to tinkering with several of Jim Wendler’s 5/3/1 templates. I learned a ton in this time and did get stronger, but I probably only hit 75% of the workouts in a typical month. I would fall off the wagon, come back and hit it too hard, experience some minor injury, and repeat. I also struggled to balance my lifting and running while training for 10-20mi trail races and didn’t have a clear sense of my training priorities. In late March 2018 I injured both of my knees. On April 2 my twin sons were born, and in late May our family relocated cross-country to be closer to family. As you might expect, this triggered a six-month period without any training whatsoever; we were all just surviving. By November I was starting to feel ready to be active again. I finally set up my home gym and ran out of excuses. It took a couple of months to get consistent, but by the beginning of February 2019 I started a streak of workouts that brings me to today. **Exercise**   I started my current streak by deloading substantially across the board, with a focus on form and finding reasonable, accurate, sustainable working weights. I spent a lot of time reflecting on my prior lifting experience and selecting a program, opting for the four-day version of nSuns’ 531LP program, to which I’ve made gradual tweaks over the course of the year. [Here’s that link to a typical current week again.](https://imgur.com/a/TdIJ0AY) While I’d like to someday move to a five-day routine, the four-day program has given me the flexibility I need to hit 100% of the workouts. The main lifts are programmed in the template, but I did spend a lot of time finding accessories that match my functional and physique goals. My number one priority is building a stronger, thicker back, and I’ve adjusted the routine over the course of the year to add back volume. This is followed by improving my shoulder health, combating computer posture, and getting enough core volume. The most substantial change I’ve made, after a bout of PT for nagging shoulder and neck pain this summer, was swapping close-grip bench for barbell row on the second bench day and adding exercises to strengthen my rotator cuff. I’ll be happy to answer any questions about my programming decisions in the comments. Finally, I take a low-key approach of listening to my body. I don’t recover from workouts like I used to, so if I have a nagging pain I back off for a week or two, and I take deload weeks when I can tell I’m getting beat up and need a break. **Diet**   After a month or two of streaking without focusing on my diet, I spent six months between March and August gradually bulking without tracking calories or macros; I just didn’t have the mental space to try and manage that while focusing on just hitting my workouts. While bulking from 165 to 190 I did have two goals: eat a lot of food and get \~30 grams of protein every 3-4 hours. That’s all I focused on. Prior to this period I spent literal years tracking my diet, so I know from experience that I maintain weight at \~2800 calories per day. More importantly, I have an intuitive sense of how much food that is. That said, I put on some excess weight bulking and perhaps could have done it “cleaner.” Key bulking foods for me: homemade yogurt and granola, protein granola bars, big bowls of cereal, a couple of protein shakes per day. I like MyProtein Impact Whey, which I buy unflavored in the giant 11lb sacks and mix with milk and 3g of creatine per day. Toward the end of my bulk I felt huge, full all the time, and ready to lose some weight. From September through mid-December I cut from 190 down to 170 using intermittent fasting. I tracked my diet religiously during this point, shooting for 2300 calories/day and 105-120 grams of protein. I prefer to eat a moderate-fat diet based on foods I like, so I found it difficult to increase my protein intake beyond this level while maintaining a deficit. I did not reduce my workout volume while cutting, except to deload somewhat more often. My lifts didn’t decrease much over this period. When doing IF I’d fast until noon, then eat an 800 calorie lunch, a 200-300 calorie afternoon snack, and the remaining 1000-1300 calories at dinner. I enjoy a beer or two in the evenings and like to feel full. I wasn’t religious about timing my final calories for the day to start my fast. Since mid-December I’ve taken breaks from fasting and fasted a little here and there. My weight is basically unchanged. **Lessons Learned**   My big takeaway from the last year it that it’s hard to build new habits and you really have to choose your battles. Could I have bulked more efficiently? Could I have cut harder or longer? Could I have made more aggressive progress in my lifts? Maybe, but I might also have been spreading myself too thin, fallen off the wagon and wound up where I started. As a thirty-something dad with three kids under five years old, my time, energy and mental space are so finite, and I think I’ve spent my limited resources in the best possible way this year. Of course, I also feel a tremendous sense of pride. I’ve seen physique progress for the first time in my life, but more importantly I feel stronger and more functional in challenging tasks. I feel like I’ve built the foundation for my future gains. Finally, never underestimate the power of a streak, or finding whatever little psychological tricks you can play on yourself to get where you want to be. **Next Steps**   As for the future, I’m writing this with an ice pack on my groin recovering from a vasectomy so rest is on my mind. I’m going to continue the streak with something light tomorrow and spend the next two weeks on a long 50% deload. I want to focus on resting up, easing the various aches and pains, and getting stoked for another year. I’ll probably never bulk more than 10lb at a time again, but once I hit 180 I’ll cut 5-10lb off and generally just gradually try to get bigger and leaner over time. My major training goal for 2020 is to focus on time under tension and really quality reps. If you made it this far, thanks for reading! I’m happy to continue the discussion in the comments.","From dad bod to dayum daddy. All seriousness, this is incredible man, really good work. I can't imagine managing a full training schedule along with three kids, that is superdad mode and I respect it! Keep it up!!",546
fk7jvp,"**TL;DR** * **Gender:** Male * **Age:** 20 * **Height:** 6'2'' * **Weight Progression:** 187 lbs -> 170 lbs (cut) -> 205 lbs (bulk) -> 193 lbs (current cut) [**BEFORE & AFTER PHOTO**](https://imgur.com/a/nnsfUoi) [**FULL PHOTO ALBUM**](https://imgur.com/a/2lG0iih) **OVERVIEW** Hey all, like many others I've lurked on this sub for a while and found these progress posts very motivating, so here I finally am with mine. Up until 2019 I had never trained properly or learned about nutrition - I had goofed around in the gym a little bit but without any notable progress. I started in January 2019, weighing 187 lbs, by doing calisthenics / bodyweight training along with keto and 16/8 intermittent fasting (as well as logging calories). I gained a bit of strength and achieved some calisthenics skills, but I ended up completely neglecting lower body strength during this time, which has still been a weak-point since. In terms of physique, I really just wanted to see a six-pack on myself for the first time -- I achieved this, weighing 170 lbs at the end, but retrospectively ended up looking very skinny. Then in May 2019 I started my bulk and finally started lifting properly. I ran the [Reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/), which I've seen great results on. During the summer, for a month or so, I was also biking 10 miles home from work every day. I continued my bulk through the end of 2019 and ate big the whole time (that hasn't ever been an issue for me). I switched my routine to [nSuns LP 5-day](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/nsuns-lp/) in October 2019 because I was bored and stalling on the PPL. At the end of the year I was weighing 205+ lbs and feeling a bit too fluffy. Finally, I started my current cut in January 2020 and have gotten down to 193 lbs so far, with a general goal of getting to 180 lbs by May (not sure if that's still happening). This time I've simply been counting calories and loosely intermittent fasting (just skipping breakfast), with a little more of an IIFYM approach. I was still running nSuns and enjoying it, but my progress slowed down (starting with OHP) during the cut and recently I had been having some trouble recovering (definitely wasn't sleeping well enough either). Currently it looks like I'll be taking a break from lifting because I, like many of you, no longer have access to a gym (due to coronavirus) -- so I'll try to maintain by doing some calisthenics in the meantime. Who knows, maybe I'll even get some conditioning in by starting to jog regularly for the first time! **ROUTINES** **Calisthenics Upper-Lower Split (January-May 2019):** Upper (Monday/Wednesday/Friday): * Skill progressions: L-sit, back lever. * Pushup variation 3x6-12, pick one of: (Decline pushups, wide/diamond grip pushups, archer pushups, clapping pushups, or one-arm pushups). * Pullup variation 3x6-12: (Wide/close grip pullup/chinup, weighted pullup, L-sit pullup, commando pullup, head bangers, one-arm pullup progression, or muscle-up progression). * Dip 3x8-15: (One-arm bench dip, explosive bench dip, or front dip) * Horizontal pulling 3x6-10: (Tuck front lever row) * Vertical pushing 3x6-10: (Pike pushups) * Abs: Using Athlean-X six-pack app Lower (Tuesday/Thursday): * Skill progression: Handstand. * Leg exercise 4x5-12: (Archer squats, pistol squat progression, lunge). * Explosive leg exercise 3x8-15: (Squat jump, jumping lunge). * Calf exercise 5x15-25: (One-leg calf raise) * Abs: Using Athlean-X six-pack app Looking back this wasn't the greatest routine, it was just something I got off Youtube but at least it got me started. During this period of my training I will admit I often skipped the leg days. **Reddit PPL (May-October 2019):** At this point I ran [Metallicdpa's PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/), which many of you are familiar with. Now that I actually started using weights, here were my stats **(5 RM weights, in lbs)**: Bench Press: 135 -> 200 Deadlift: 135 -> 315 Squat: 115 -> 155 OHP: 75 -> 120 Row: 115 -> 195 At this point I know what you're thinking about, that squat. I want to clarify that I was no longer skipping leg days at this point, but for some reason I kept stalling and failing on my squats (later came to realize I've had horrid form). **nSuns LP 5-day (October 2019-March 2020):** Finally I switched to [nSuns](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/nsuns-lp/), which has been my absolute favorite. I love the volume and heavy sets, although it has definitely been harder to keep up on the cut than during the bulk. Here are the stats **(1 RM weights, in lbs)**: Bench Press: 235 -> **260** Deadlift: 365 -> **395** Squat: 205 -> **225** OHP: 145 -> **165** I am happy with the progress I've made on bench, deadlift and OHP but obviously not with the squat. Throughout my training I've been discovering mistakes I'm making in my squat form, but it still doesn't feel dialed in yet -- at this point I might just go ahead and get help from a trainer, because this is seriously impeding my progress and frankly kind of embarrassing. As for my nSuns accessory exercises, I've made some changes over time but most recently I was doing these: Day 1: * 3x8-12 pullups * 3x8-12 incline dumbbell bench press * 3x8-12 iso-lateral row machine * 3x8-12 incline dumbbell curl SS 3x8-12 reverse dumbell curl * 3x8-12 cable tricep extension * Ab wheel Day 2: * 3x8-12 leg press * 3x8-12 leg curl * 3x8-12 seated calf raises Day 3: * 3x8-12 hammer curl SS 3x8-12 dumbell shrugs * 3x8-12 cable crossover * 3x8-12 face pulls * 3x8-12 dumbell lateral raise * Ab wheel Day 4: * 3x8-12 iso-lateral row machine * 3x8-12 seated calf raises Day 5: * 3x5 EZ-bar preacher curls SS 3x12 dumbbell shrugs * 3x8-12 incline dumbbell curls * 3x8-12 cable overhead tricep extension * 3x20 face pulls * 3x8-12 cable lateral raise **DIET** During the first cut phase, I was doing keto which I found to be effective for quickly losing weight, but it felt overly restrictive and I don't think I could train while doing keto anymore. I was also doing 16/8 intermittent fasting which made it easier to eat less. Finally, I was also counting calories and macros with Lose It! My protein goal was to get about 1 g/lbs, while cutting at a rate of about 2 lbs / week (don't remember the calorie count). When I started the bulk I was initially still counting calories but soon stopped and just focused on eating big and frankly indulging myself. During this period I wasn't weighing myself either, it was all free rein, but because of all this my bulk may have gotten a little dirty. Now in my current cutting phase I'm counting calories again and aiming for about 2100 calories, for a weight loss rate of about 1.5 lbs / week. This time around I haven't really been tracking macros or protein, for better or worse, but haven't had any issues yet. The reason for this is because during my first cut phase I was cooking for myself which made it easier to track, whereas I've been eating dining hall food since then. **SUPPLEMENTS** I've been supplementing with protein (whey and/or casein) throughout this period, although not as consistently in the past few months. I started supplementing creatine at the beginning of the summer although I honestly can't tell if it makes a difference. Since the start of my cut this Spring I've been drinking Amino Energy (contains EAAs and caffeine) before my fasted workouts. And no, I do not use any steroids.","# YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWW Howdy cowpokes! It's time again for everybody's favorite game - Natty Police Roundup!

fla1ka,"TL; DR: I wasn't happy about my state and was uncertain about how to begin. I was all over the place and didn’t know what I was doing, the best thing I did was to get out of my head, over myself, and start. As a result, I ended up acquiring so much more than I could ever imagine. Progress Pics: Edit: [Added album](https://imgur.com/a/2t0TrWx) [2017 - 2019](https://imgur.com/6JsLYYC) [End 2017](https://imgur.com/jqs6EHp) [Mid 2018](https://imgur.com/wECqxBW) [End 2018](https://imgur.com/7ZG2hZC) [Mid 2019](https://imgur.com/fZHWETh) [Sept 2019](https://imgur.com/7FEv2CB) [End 2019](https://imgur.com/HQPPPdh) **October 2017:** Age: 29 Height: 5’7” Weight: 185lbs I started going to the gym 2-3x a week Cardio: 5-10 mins at a comfortable pace, just enough to break a sweat. 20-25 mins on various machines. Stopped completely after the 2nd week. **December 2017:** I saw a video, US Navy Admiral, William McRaven gave a speech about starting your day off by making your bed. I can’t remember which friend shared it but thank you. I was once in the military so this hit me real hard. Where’s the officer in me now? What the hell happened? I had an honest conversation with myself and I was disgusted that I gave up so easily. I went to the gym every day for a month until January. *Workout:* I worked on muscles that weren’t sore from previous workouts, utilizing basic machines. I mostly worked on the chest, back, biceps, triceps, shoulders. During this month, there were days where I was sick, weak, and not feeling it at all, I still went anyway. On separate occasions I’ve spent only 5-10 mins on random machines, a few push-ups/pull-ups, I’ve spent < 10 seconds at the gym only to weigh myself and then leave. *Lifestyle/Diet:* My caloric intake was terrible because I was consuming anywhere between 3500-4500 calories a day with minimal movement. I knew I had to start with my eating habits, I didn’t want a diet, I wanted a lifestyle. Dieting didn’t make any sense to me because I didn’t want any dietary restrictions, I wanted a lifestyle that works for me, one where I get to eat and cook anything oily and flavorful without worrying if it would hinder my progress. I began ordering half of what I usually do when I ate out. I ate half of my usual portions. E.g. 4 bowls of rice + various entrees per meal => 2 bowls of rice + leftovers for my next meal. I love food a lot, I enjoy eating out and trying new restaurants. Ordering enough to feed 4+ people and finishing all of it in a sitting is my usual. I also enjoy cooking, my fridge, pantry, and cabinets are always full of food. I only throw out food that I don’t eat or can’t fix in the kitchen. **April 2018:** *Workout:* 3-5x a week for 1hr 30 mins. Stopped cardio. 90% upper body exercises with machines. I included different exercises I found on [bodybuilding.com](http://bodybuilding.com/) and modified some of them to my preference, mostly for experimenting. *Lifestyle/Diet:* Started intermittent fasting, My window was 2 pm – 12 am. I ate out a lot for dinner, this included fast food runs especially when there was a deal. I loved the $1 Menus from Wendys, McDonalds, Taco Bell, Burger King, spicy dark meat only family meals from Popeyes. I would combine a bunch of patties and avoid some of the bread, when I ate 7 pieces of fried chicken, I would eat only 3-4 pieces of fried skin. I also developed a love for white sauced based pizzas, especially with unlimited toppings. 3000 - 3500 calories/day Protein: \~0.7 g/lb of bodyweight. 1 shake (2 scoops, 48g) a day By this time my body fat dropped to \~20-25% from 30-35% **September 2018:** *Workout:* * 3-5x a week for 1 hr. * Incorporated dumbbells and free weights, 75% machine/25% free weights. *Lifestyle/Diet:* * Changed my IF window, 2 pm – 10 pm. **January 2019:** *Workout:* * 4-5x a week, 45 mins – 1 hr. * Incorporated drop sets every few days. * Less rest between sets. * Increased workout frequency and reduced duration * Discovered more exercises, realized the angle of an exercise is important too, incorporated variations. *Lifestyle/Diet:* * 3300 - 3500 calories/day * Stopped IF. * I developed a better sense of nutrition values in the food I ate. * Hit my daily protein intake more often. * Ate more fat and protein, less carbs. * Protein: \~0.8g/lb of bodyweight **June 2019:** *Workout:* * 2-3x a week, 60 – 90 mins. * Stopped hating workouts. It was now tolerable. * Started listening to music, it helped me focus a lot more on the exercise and “feeling” the workout. * Replaced longer rests between my sets to stretching, switching muscle groups with calisthenics(dips, various goal progression exercises) and much lighter exercises to fix form, target the intended muscles. * Began to set goals (one arm pull-up, planchet, front-lever, handstand). * 75% gym (50% Machines, 50% free weights). * 25% calisthenics. * Learned and included more exercises from Google and various resources. * If my goal was 10 reps, I tried to do 13. I’ve never hit 13. * Started focusing on concentric and eccentric movements * Picked up different ways to overload exercises progressively (Added weights to calisthenics). *Lifestyle/Diet:* * 3000 - 3500 calories/day * Ate at least 2 packs of instant ramen a day, 3+ if I felt I needed more calories. I added ingredients like Costco chicken tenderloins, beef cubes, sausage, shrimp, clams and cheese. * Protein: \~0.8g/lb of bodyweight * BF% is at \~10% **November 2019** *Workout:* * Shifted my workouts from 8 – 9 pm to 7 – 8 pm. * 4-5x a week, 30 – 45 mins.75% gym (60% free weights, 40% machines). * 25% calisthenics. * Started isolating various muscle groups. * Improved my form tremendously by taking time to feel the exercise and its full range of motion. * Better understanding of concentric and eccentric movements. * Combined exercises (Pull-ups => L-sit Pull-ups to engage my core). * Engage more muscle groups for any exercise (Engage my core while doing bicep curls). * Stopped paying attention to weight numbers, counting reps/sets. * More focus on performing the exercise with the right form (If I wasn’t happy with a set, I’d lower the weight so I can perform additional reps with the correct form) *Lifestyle/Diet:* * 3000 - 3500 calories/day * Reduced the number of instant noodles I ate to only 1 – 1.5 a day as I developed hives. * Reduced the number of microwaveables I ate (Hot pockets, pizza, pizza rolls, nuggets, and many more). * Made it a point to eat more vegetables. **January 2020** *Workout:* * Shifted my workouts from 7 – 8 pm to 6 – 7 pm. * Working out is now a way for me to destress, still don’t love it, but I can lean into it when stressed, and it’s been part of my weekly routine. I’ve come too far to regress, hopefully I'll love it one day! * 4-5x/week, 30-60 mins *Lifestyle/Diet:* * 3000 - 3500 calories/day * Protein: \~0.8g / lb of bodyweight. 2 shakes (1.5 – 2scoops, 36 – 48g) a day * Started eating daily multi-vitamins. BF% \~ 7 – 10%? **March 2020 – Current** Age: 31 Height: 5’7” Weight: 146 lbs *Workout:* After 2 years of working out, I no longer have to think of what I should do when I go in, I know what to do based on what I did in my previous workouts, my performance in previous workouts, and listening to my body. * I try different/new things at the gym to make working out interesting. * I’m more efficient when I’m resting, I try to do something (dips, pull-ups, low weight variations of an exercise) while resting between sets. * Shifted my workouts from 6 – 7 pm to 7 – 8 am. * 4-5x/week, 30-60 mins * Still no cardio * My workouts are still 90% upper body intentionally, I do legs sometimes while resting between sets. Added lift numbers: Deadlift: 245lbs (4x45, 2x10) 8-10 reps, no straps. 315lbs (4x45, 2x35, 2x10) 4 reps with lifting straps. Bench press: 205lbs (2x45, 2x35) 8-10 reps 225lbs (4x45) 2 reps. 70% gym (60% free weights, 40% machines) * Bench press 1x/week * Deadlifts 1x/week – 2 weeks 30% calisthenics * Handstand (wall walk, body, handstand shrugs, pikes) * One arm pull-up (weighted pull-ups, archer pull-ups, one arm shoulder shrugs, scapula shrugs, resistance band assisted one-arm pull-ups) * Planche (Tucked planche, assisted straddle planche) * I rotate my exercises and angles, try new exercises and see if I like them. I do research to see if an exercise places unnecessary stress on my rotator cuff, head, neck, etc. Equipment: * Resistance bands. * Lifting straps for overloading deadlifts. * Dip belts to add weight to calisthenics. *Lifestyle/Diet:* * 3300 - 3800 calories/day. * Increased calories consumed per day. * Protein: \~0.9g/lb of bodyweight. 2 shakes (2 scoops, 48g) a day. * I don't usually do desserts except for specific chocolates and chocolate ice cream on special occasions \~1 - 2x a month. * I snack at least 3x a week at night, I eat popcorn, cheetos, doritos, and more. I limit myself to 300-500 calories a day. I break this rule oftentimes, and I'll readjust my calories accordingly by eating 0.5 bowls less of rice the next day, 6 fewer pizza rolls or 1 slice less of pizza depending on what I eat. I  can't tell you the exact calories, but estimating calories is a skill I've acquired during my journey. * Things I eat/cook :    * My main proteins are beef, chicken, eggs, pork, lamb, fish, shrimp, squid, clams. I have most of these in my fridge/freezer at the same time and use some or all of them in my cooking. All Costco.    * I don't always cook from scratch to save time, but it's still tasty as hell for sure.    * Fast food 1-2 times a week with coke zero, fries once in a while.    * Eat out several times a week. Any cuisine.    * White sauce pastas.    * Steak, ribeye.    * Stir-fried proteins.    * Curries, soups and stews, a lot of protein, vegetables, and easy to cook.    * Noodles: fried, stir-fried with sauce, soup, noodles in different ways.    * Rice: Fried rice, clay pot rice, rice 3000 ways.    * Baked rice is a fun one, I'll fry a Chinese, Thai, Indian or some SEA style of fried rice, put it on a pyrex tray, sprinkle tons of cheese over it and then bake it.    * Microwaveables, instant ramen, canned food, dumplings.    * Baked/Air-fry/Convection oven foods: Roast chicken, baked chicken, beef, fish, etc. * Equipment:    * Electric range, 5 heating elements.    * Rice cooker    * Sous vide    * Instantpot    * Convection oven    * Griddle/Teppanyaki grill    * Hotpot    * Air fryer    * Flame torch BF% \~9 - 11%. *Goals:* * Workout < 6 am * Perfect my form for all exercises. * Increase time spent on calisthenics from 30 – 40%. * Allocate more time for free weights, rely less on machines. * Find some way to incorporate squats. * Hold a vertical handstand for > 40 seconds consistently. * Straight front lever (currently at 70%). * Straddle planche (70%). * One arm pull-up (\~50%). * Variations of getting to a vertical handstand, Pike, L-sit, V-sit, etc. *Principles I live by:* * Calorie in, calorie out.    * What goes in my body has to come out someway, somehow.    * If I'm trying to lose weight but I'm not, I'm either eating too much, working out too little, or both. * Moderation is key.    * I started exercising because I needed moderation.    * There was no way I could've made any progress if I didn't fix my eating habits. * Hit my daily protein intake as much as I can.    * I grew the most when I ate the most.    * It's really tough, shakes make up almost 50% of my daily protein intake. * Try my very best not to stuff my face with too many carbs.    * Carbs are devilishly tempting and dangerous, I check myself before I wreck myself.    * I want to work out as little as possible and not regress. * Use my ego as a strength, not a weakness.    * I spent less time caring about why I could only do 7 reps today when I did 8 my last workout.    * Focus on form, less on numbers.    * I've wasted way too much time wondering and getting upset about why I can't progress another 2.5lbs. I would've burned more calories laughing at a video of my bad form, than exercising with it. * Focus, purpose, form, and control.    * I'm focusing on what I do at the gym, how I rest, and how I'm exercising unless I'm trying to learn from someone else through conversation or observation.    * My purpose in going to the gym is to get good exercise and to push boundaries.    * I developed my strength, knowledge, and awareness when I improved my mind to muscle connection to have better control of my body, this lead to an increase in strength.    * I've seen myself with bad form and it's pretty repulsive.    * I wasted a lot of time (months) on an exercise with no improvement because I wasn't doing it correctly.    * Slowing down, taking my time to move the weight through the exercise properly gives my brain time to focus, visualize and engage the muscles correctly.    * Slamming weights isn't completing the full exercise to me, my goal is to let is rest as gently as possible. There is no reason for me to slam it unless I'll hurt myself if I don't, it's nice to follow through the entire motion and be in control at all times. * The day I don't feel like exercising, is the day I must exercise.    * These days come frequently. I'll haul my ass to the gym, and spend at least 10-15 mins on light exercise, work on less fatigued muscles, stretch, figure out what's wrong with my form, or why I'm not hitting my goals at the gym.    * I listen to my body, if I feel like I'm going to injure myself, I skip out altogether. *My Inspirations:* Gym stuff: * Anyone that I’ve spoken to about fitness, most of what I do and know today is based on our conversations. * The usuals I see at my gym. I learned so much from our conversations, exchanging tips, and your guidance. * Others at the gym. We’ve never communicated before, but I’ve seen your focus, form, and types of workouts. I’ve tried most of them, incorporated and modified some. * ATHLEAN-X: When Jeff says ANYTHING, I damn well listen. I go to him to learn about isolating muscle groups, form, understanding why certain exercises are good or bad, how to exercise, what to exercise, what not to do. If I have a question about a muscle group or exercise, I look to him first. Also, Jesse and face pulls. Calisthenics: * OFFICIALTHENX: Chris inspired me to get back into calisthenics, Osvaldo inspired me to take it seriously, I love the way Stefan explains, Zay, Paz, and John are beasts. Very cool dudes doing very cool things. * Artem Morozov: Artem is ridiculously strong, incredible and inspiring guy. I also follow SaturnoMovement, Tom Merrick, Calisthenicmovement and others. There are tons of great resources out there. I hope this is helpful, thanks for reading!","Oh boy, here we go again.  Some dude made progress!!!  And now everyone not making progress is crawling out of the woodwork to ask about steroids.  OP has said he is natural (because fucking duh) so lets all move on and focus on reality and the things that OP actually did.   Any steroid questions or accusations from this point on will be met with gleeful bans.   Happy Thursday!",506
fnrkhd,"A lot of people are currently without gym access due to quarantines and lockdowns, so **[I wrote an article](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/no-gym/)** about how to go about maintaining your progress or making gains without gym access. To be clear, it's not a ""how to set up a home gym"" article (if you have the money and space for a home gym, gym closures probably aren't affecting you much), and it's not written with the assumption that you're planning on joining /r/bodyweightfitness and never going to the gym again.  Rather, it's about strategies you can use to adapt ""normal"" strength or hypertrophy training for a period of time without gym access with minimal cost. Since gyms are so ubiquitous (and affordable, in most places), I think most people just haven't ever had to think about how they'd train for weeks or months without a gym.  However, you can do some effective training with no equipment or very minimal equipment. ""Push"" training is pretty easy; push-ups, bodyweight triceps extensions, and handstand push-ups are all good ways to train your pecs, triceps, and delts.  You can progress by increasing reps over time instead of increasing load, or you can progress to increasingly challenging variations of these exercises to increase intensity. ""Pull"" training is a little more challenging with absolutely no equipment, but is quite a bit easier if you have an over-the-doorframe pull-up bar.  Without a pull-up bar, table rows are a great option, and you can add load by loading a backpack with books or other heavy household items.  If there are trees nearby, you can do pull-ups on a tree branch (again, using a backpack for added resistance).  And if you have some large water jugs, you can use them as dumbbells for curls. Lower body training is more of a challenge.  Bodyweight squats probably come to mind first, but they're quite easy for people who are already in pretty good shape.  However, strict step-ups (just tapping your heel to the floor, and getting no assistance from your down leg) are WAY more challenging than a lot of people realize, even if you're just using your body weight as resistance, and are easy to progress since you probably have items of varying heights around your house.  Building toward pistols is also a great challenge.  And if you don't have knee issues, bodyweight sissy squats can also provide a great challenge to your quads.  For posterior chain training, single-leg glute bridges are surprisingly challenging, especially if performed strictly, and it's fairly easy to add load via a loaded backpack.  If you have someone or something to anchor your ankles, nordic hamstrings curls are HARD. If you're willing to make just one purchase, you should seriously consider a set of bands.  It would be impossible to list every exercise you can do with a set of strong resistance bands, because the list would include virtually every exercise you could do with barbells or machines.  Bands also help you add resistance or assistance to virtually all bodyweight exercises. In terms of programming, progressive overload is still the name of the game.  Instead of just adding more weight to the bar, you may need to be a little more creative.  With bodyweight exercises, you can either increase reps, or increase intensity by building up to more challenging versions of the exercises you're doing.  You can also increase weight via a loaded backpack for a lot of exercises.  For band exercises, you can either add more bands into the mix, or choke up on bands to increase intensity; you can also just add reps.  In general, as long as you have an objective way to make and measure progress, you should be able to maintain muscle pretty easily, and probably keep building muscle.  In terms of strength, your maxes may be down a bit once you can get back under a bar, but as long as you maintained or built muscle, any strength decrements should simply be due to rusty motor patterns, rather than ""true"" strength losses. As long as you have a good idea of the exercises at your disposal, you shouldn't need to make any huge changes to a training program.  Just sub out your current exercises for other exercises that accomplish the same basic purpose, probably change the set/rep scheme (for people on strength programs, you're probably going to be looking at higher rep ranges for the time being), and keep the gains rolling. **[Here's the link to the article again](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/no-gym/)**.

gomwgi,"# Murph Every Week for a Year ***“I’ve come too far to only come this far”.*** Start: M50/180lbs (81.6kg)/5’8 (172cm) – End: M51/185lbs (83.9kg)/5’8 (172cm) *** **WHAT IS MURPH?** [From Crossfit.com](https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2005/08/18#/comments) >For time: 1 mile Run, 100 Pull-ups, 200 Push-ups, 300 Squats, 1 mile Run >In memory of Navy Lieutenant Michael Murphy, 29, of Patchogue, N.Y., who was killed in Afghanistan June 28th, 2005. >This workout was one of Mike's favorites and he'd named it ""Body Armor"". From here on it will be referred to as ""Murph"" in honor of the focused warrior and great American who wanted nothing more in life than to serve this great country and the beautiful people who make it what it is. >Partition the pull-ups, push-ups, and squats as needed. Start and finish with a mile run. If you've got a twenty pound vest or body armor, wear it. Murph is traditionally run once a year on US Memorial Day (last Monday of May). *** **WHY EVERY WEEK FOR A YEAR?** Around end of March 2019, I got injured when squatting (relatively light weight) without bracing adequately – something pinged deep in my left glute/hip region and I unwisely tried to continue through the pain. Over the next few weeks, although the pain began to subside, anytime I attempted to squat or deadlift anything over 60kg, the shooting pain would return. A PT suggested I give squatting and deadlifting a rest “for a while”. Naturally, I immediately catastrophised my situation and thought my lifting days were over. She also gave me a 30 minute stretching routine, which I kept up for 2 months, but which seemed to be having no positive effect. Around this time, /r/Weightroom posted a challenge to attempt a Murph. I knew I was able to perform 100 pullups, having been through a few cycles of Building the Monolith, and figured that I’d be able to complete it if I could get through the air squats without the pain being too great. In the weeks leading up to the challenge, I did 4 dry runs unweighted. What I discovered was that while the pain was manageable during the running, the high reps of squats actually helped relieve the pain (albeit marginally). On the day of the WR challenge I made the last minute decision to perform the Murph with my 10kg weighted vest, and completed in just under an hour. After the Weightroom challenge I had the idea that committing to a Murph a week for a year would be a good way to regularly push myself and build/maintain my conditioning, while rehabbing and hopefully rebuilding my squat and deadlift from an ego-squashing 60kg with 531 3 day Full Body BBB/BBS. I thought that by the end of the 52 weeks, I would at the very least “get better at doing Murphs”. *** **HOW?** I initially performed the Murph as one of 4 variations depending on how I was feeling each week: * Unweighted/Partitioned: 1m, 20x(5xPLU/10xPSUs/15xSQ), 1m * Weighted/Partitioned: +10kg WV - 1m, 20x(5xPLU/10xPSUs/15xSQ), 1m  * Unweighted/Unpartitioned: 1m, 100 PLU, 200 PSU, 300 SQ, 1m * Weighted/ Unpartitioned: +10kg WV - 1m, 100 PLU, 200 PSU, 300 SQ, 1m However, by week 14 I realised that leaving the choice of variant to “how I was feeling” was skewing the Murphs in favour of unweighted Murphs. I decided that I would maintain the discipline of performing each Murph as above in a repeating 4 week cycle. Pullups were strict. My shoulders would not have been able to cope with kipping pullups. I completed all the mile runs on a treadmill except week 4 when I was on holiday. I built a homegym in November, but continued visiting my commercial gym for the Murphs, until I bought a treadmill in January. I could have run outside, but I live on a busy main road, and running a mile would have meant being delayed while waiting at various traffic lights. (If this triggers the Murph Police to mobilise, and invalidate the 52 week challenge, fuck ‘em.) *** **DEVIATIONS** * Week 8: Unweighted/Unpartitioned Murph and a half: 1m, 150PLU/300PSU/450SQ, 1m * Week 13: 2 consecutive Unweighted/Unpartitioned Murphs: 1m, 100 PLU, 200 PSU, 300 SQ, 2m, 100 PLU, 200 PSU, 300 SQ, 1m * Week 15: 5 consecutive Unweighted/Partitioned Murphs: 5x(1m, 20x(5xPLU/10xPSUs/15xSQ), 1m) NB this took just under 5 hours and 15 minutes, and was an impulsive, competitive response to u/IA_EGG completing 4 Murphs (cheers mate!). It was also pretty fucking horrific. * I did weeks 33, 35 and 38 barefoot.  *** **DIET AND WEIGHT** From July to November, I cut weight using u/nSuns TDEE spreadsheet and [went from 179lbs to 161lbs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11abq3xs9aqGmRqjwj3TB9rDZwtQMzcjf/view?usp=sharing), eating mainly oats, yoghurt, chicken, fish, steak, rice and veggies + protein shakes. While the Murphs didn’t necessarily get easier, my running speed and overall endurance improved, and the pullups were far less taxing on my body. However, my upper body lifts (which hadn’t been affected by the injury) really began to take a nosedive. If I’d maintained the lowest weight of 161lbs until the end of the challenge, my Murph PR times would most likely have been lower.  But as my injury finally cleared up around December, my goals and priorities shifted as my squat and deadlift numbers began moving closer to pre-injury levels and I began eating whatever I liked. Despite my weight increasing, I’ve still been hitting Murph PRs up until week 48. As of today, I’m up to 185lbs.  I don’t drink alcohol. *** **PRS** Murph | Slowest | Fastest :--|:--|:-- Weighted/Unpartitioned | 1:03:29 | 54:26 Weighted/Partitioned | 53:14 | 43:28 Unweighted/Unpartitioned | 55:39 | 44:50 Unweighted/Partitioned | 47:32 | 33:01 [Here’s the spreadsheet with all timings]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YHAHiYZZSBm1heC3Vpc455CxZV71B_Tz-nSnO8iNGso/edit?usp=sharing) *** **BODY COMPOSITION PICS**  Please note these pics are not the result of Murphs alone - I was running the weekly Murph alongside 3-4 days lifting, and additional running. I’m not on TRT, nor do I use PEDs.

Although the year-long challenge might appear daft on paper, the reality was I had to work hard FOR LESS THAN AN HOUR A WEEK. And it quickly became apparent this wasn’t an endurance challenge, more a single-minded exercise in discipline. Having said that, there were times I pondered my hubris and thought, “why the fuck am I doing this?”. Fortunately, posting weekly updates in r/Weightroom kept me accountable. * There seemed to be no discernible pattern to how well or how badly I performed overall. I could feel great before starting, but get a poor time. I could feel shit or exhausted or hungry before I started but then manage to shave minutes off previous PRs. I’d hit PRs with tired legs on days that immediately followed heavy squats or deadlifts, or would maddeningly miss PRs despite feeling fresh from the previous day of complete rest. I’d keep an eye on the timer during partitioned Murphs and know at the halfway point if I was in with a decent chance of beating the previous PR, only to push a little too hard and just not have quite enough in the tank to run the final mile fast enough. It was a baffling, inexact science. * During one of the weighted unpartitioned Murphs mid-challenge, it felt like I was beginning to develop tendonitis in my arms, but fortunately this cleared up. I had toyed with the idea of maybe celebrating the completion of the 52 weeks with a Weighted Unpartitioned ‘Murph Every Day for a Week’, or maybe a 24 hour Murph, but as I inched closer towards the end of the challenge, I realised that volume of pullups would be problematic and would likely cause injury. About 10 weeks ago I completely abandoned the idea. I’ve since found out there’s recently been a few people who’ve run Unweighted Murph Every Day for a Month challenges, but these have generally invoked the wrath of r/Crossfit as “a stupid idea” and “muh rhabdo”.  * My best, most consistent results for Partitioned were by doing 20 sets of 5/10/15. I tried 10 sets of 10/20/30, and while achievable, I needed more time to recover between sets. Unweighted, I built to the point where I was able to consistently get through the 20 sets with little if any breaks between sets. I had to keep a written tally mid-Murph otherwise I’d forget which set I was on because numbers is hard. * I switched from 531 3 Day Full Body BBB/BBS to 4 Day BBB/BBS at the end of June 2019, with the intention of adding more running to the 2 upper body days to coincide with the previously mentioned weight cut. In Feb 2020 I began Stronger by Science’s Average to Savage 2.0 4 day RTF variant. I’m currently just over the midway point. My weekly runs average 15-25km, and I also occasionally add in hill sprints. * Conditioning, stamina and overall endurance improved. When I started the Murphs I had to plan my days around them as I’d be pretty wiped out afterwards. Once I got a few months into the challenge, I’d feel recovered within a few minutes. There was a definite carryover to my lifting with much reduced rest times between sets, pushups adding to weekly chest volume, and an increase in ability to push harder on AMRAP sets. Notable recent AMRAP sets on Average to Savage have included [Deadlift 160kg 1x14](https://imgur.com/a/mN7TZ6t) ; Bench 92.5kg 1x13; Standing Abwheel Rollouts 1x20.  *** **MURPH TIPS (YMMV)** * I wasted money on 2 unsuitable weighted vests: one that went up to 40kg was far too constrictive around the torso, and looked like something a suicide bomber might wear; and a cheap ebay 10kg one whose fasteners broke after a couple of weeks. Around Week 23 I bit the bullet and bought a more pricey, heavy duty one from [Bulldog UK]( https://www.bulldoggear.eu/collections/weighted-vests/products/weighted-vest) that has been comfortable, durable and well worth the money. If you’re going to be doing weighted Murphs (or indeed anything that requires a weighted vest – WVs are a fantastic conditioning tool), it’s a false economy to buy cheap shit.  * I was told that running with a weighted vest would definitely fuck up my joints/back/ankles. It didn’t. If you’re unsure whether your body parts can tolerate the addition of 10kg/20lbs, try running with lighter weights and build up. If you’re fearful of trying that, there’s nothing to stop your Murph being unweighted – it will still be a Murph. * Take that first mile easy. If you get to the pullups puffing, panting and breathing out of your arse, you’re going to need longer recovery/rest times. I found my sweet spot for the first mile to be around 11.5kph (around 8m30 mile) Unweighted, and around 9.2-9.5kph (around 10m20 mile) for Weighted. * Also for partitioned, if you’re going for a PR, don’t expend any unnecessary energy or time by wandering around. Be efficient: drop from the pullups, do the pushups, stand up and do the squats. * Rather than holding your breath and bracing for the pushups and squats (which you may have a tendency to do automatically), try to maintain a natural breathing rhythm. And don’t go balls to the wall with the reps - if you slow them down and breathe naturally without exhaling on every rep, you’ll gas less quickly. **EDIT FOR CLARITY - if you're squatting with a barbell you absolutely hold your breath and brace. Do NOT breathe naturally if you are squatting with weights.** * For the unpartitioned sets, don’t take the pullups and pushups to failure, otherwise you’ll need longer recovery/rest times. For the unpartitioned weighted squats, I found best results from doing 15-20, rest-pausing then 10, longer rest then repeat. Unweighted I built up to 50 on the first set, followed by a 40, then 20-30 for the remainder). * For the final mile, your legs are likely to be wobbly as fuck at first, making you feel as elegant as a horse on ice-skates. Start as slow as necessary, but ramp it up and push that last half mile like a mofo. Sprint finish if you can. * If you begin to feel like you are becoming Champion of the Murphs, check out [this 59 year old badass]( https://barbend.com/24-hours-murph/). *** **TLDR** Old bloke gave it some welly and did a thing for a year.  ***","Holy hell, nice work. I love it when people post in depth about these kind of things. Edit: Have you ever done the strength potion pyramid style? When I do a Murph I typically do a pyramid 1-10-1 with pull ups and do double the amount for push ups and triple for squats. I feel like it makes it more manageable.",575
gvwncc,"On the mod team, we had a long discussion about whether or not to make a post like this. r/Fitness is something we traditionally maintain as a ""politics free"" zone, partially because it tends to inspire a lot of vitriol, and partially because it tends to dominate everything and we want to be at least one small oasis where people can take a breather. As we all talked about it, u/vikingmechanic said something I feel is very poignant: > As one of the largest fitness forums on the internet, I think seeing the strength training and strength sports community rally behind their plight can feel very comforting and supporting for a lot of people - in the same way I imagine us taking zero tolerance policies on sexists is offering comfort and safety for women gym goers. Current events and protests are centered on racism, but bigotry takes many different forms and on r/Fitness we extend zero welcome and zero tolerance to all of them. It is our standing opinion that hateful bigots have no place in either the world of fitness or the world in general. We encourage everyone within the sound of our voice to do what they can to support peaceful efforts to change the world for the better. Some can do less than others, and that's okay. It admittedly may not be very much to just make a post about it, but this post is backed by our on-going commitment to keeping bigotry out of this community, and ultimately we feel something small is better than silence, and if we can inspire anyone to take a more solid action, then it hasn't been nothing. It feels a bit cliche to use this quote, but: > We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. Today we feel it is important to make it known that here, at least, we have taken a side.","Some additional thoughts. None of us on the mod team were at all surprised at the volume of comments on this thread that were made by salty racists, people who think being contrarian is a personality, and of course good old fashioned trolls who were such cowards that they were only willing to toss slurs at us through anonymous reports. I think that is kind of sad. In a world that made more sense, we could make a post like this to signal very clearly that bigots aren't welcome here, and will be removed with prejudice, and be shocked at how much human sewage came to tell us they had a problem with that message.

h9ewhw,"Howdy folks, I wanted to share some thoughts on nutrition and get some conversation started.  Over the past 11 months, I gained 15lbs of bodyweight in pursuit of a [250lb keg press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwUjeQZmbr8) for a strongman competition that eventually got canceled and then a [axle strict press PR of 266lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d99HoIqJsk8). After that was done, I gradually cut away bodyfat, until I ended up at about the same bodyfat as the previous year but [4lbs heavier](https://i.imgur.com/vxlF982.png).  From the photos, the emphasis on pressing seemed to pay off in terms of shoulder and trap growth.   I did all of the above without ever counting calories or macros, and wanted to share how I go about eating and training to support that.  What I'm about to share below comes from a blogpost I wrote, which may make it seem a bit disjointed, but in respect for the ""no self-promotion"" rules I'm omitting the link to my blog. --- **GAINING WEIGHT** >I always endeavor to phase in small changes to get results, whether it’s training or nutrition, gaining or losing weight.  So when it comes to gaining, since I’m not counting calories or macros, rather than try to eat more at eat meal, I simply try to eat more MEALS.  You can call them snacks if that makes it easier, but either way, the point is to eat food more often than when you’re maintaining weight.  Typically the first place I add a meal is between breakfast and lunch.  From there, just keep finding places between meals to add food.  Since you’re keeping your 3 meals the same, this makes measuring effectiveness super simple.  If you’re not gaining weight, add another meal. >Eventually, this DOES get unsustainable, as you can only add so many meals until you’re just eating all the time, so when that happens, it’s again not a question of eating more OF the food you have at meals (increasing portion sizes), but, instead, adding MORE food TO the meals.  The most immediate place to do this is the pre and post training meals.  I’ll give an example with my post training meal. >My day to day post workout shake is already somewhat elaborate, but that’s because it gives me things to TAKE AWAY when fat loss comes (will discuss later).  But let’s take it for what it is: 1 cup of milk, 2 scoops of protein, 1 scoop of PB fit and some whipped cream.  Now that I want to add weight, instead of putting that in a shaker, I put it in a bowl and I mix it with 1 cup of breakfast cereal.  I’ll eat that until I stop gaining weight with it, at which point I’ll now throw in 1 cup of oatmeal.  Eat that until I don’t gain weight with it, and now I add honey.  Etc etc.  For the pre-workout meal, you can do the exact same thing.  Add some honey toast on top of your cereal and milk, or go super dirty and go for Pop-tarts. >For your meals that you’re already eating, you can start adding to them too as the need arises.  And again: you don’t have to mess with portion sizes at all: just add different foods.  I am a big fan of different meat protein sources in a meal, having a meal of steak and ribs, beef and chicken, pork and turkey, etc etc.  Additionally, this could be a time to introduce some less strict protein/fat sources.  Add cheese or sour cream, add half an avocado, mix some PB fit onto the food, etc etc.  Once again, stupidly simple: we’re not changing portion sizes, we’re adding more food period. **TRAINING FOR GAINING WEIGHT** >The big thing to keep in mind with how I eat is that eating is ALWAYS there to support training: not the other way around.  This means, I don’t chase scale weight and I don’t aim to always gain weight each week: I train VERY hard when I want to gain weight, and then I eat the way I described above in order to recover from that training.  This allows for muscular growth, rather than the infamous “dreamer bulk”, where all that was gained is fat.  If you’re not training hard enough to grow and you’re eating like you are, you simply get fat. >So how do we ensure we’re training hard enough?  When you gain weight, you have to make your body fit the program, whereas when you lose weight you make the program fit your body.  That means that, when we lose weight, we use autoregulation (will discuss specifically in that section), but for weight gain I like programs with fixed percentages, sets and reps.  Specifically programs that have all of that and are TOUGH.  The one I always advocate is Jon Andersen’s Deep Water program, which I have written of extensively in the past, and that I still maintain to this day as the most effective program I’ve ever run.  I’ve also seen it transform other lifters, so I know it’s not a fluke.  The percentage, sets and reps are all fixed on the program, and it’s a total ball buster.  The ONLY way you will get through it is if you eat big enough to recover from the workouts, and when you do that, you gain muscle.  Jim Wendler’s 5/3/1 Building the Monolith is another fantastic example.  There are very few AMRAP sets in the program, everything else is fixed, and if you work at the top end of all the assistance work, it’s a brutal program where, once again, you must eat to recover.  Super Squats is yet another fine example of a program where YOU have to change yourself in order to survive the program.  I’ve never run Smolov, but from the people I’ve heard that actually made it all the way through, eating like it was a job was critical to the success of that. >The point here is: don’t wing it, and don’t run a program that allows you to slack off.  PHUL, PHAT, PPL, etc, are all super popular and yet I see a bunch of kids failing to gain muscle on them, and it’s most likely because there’s too much room to slack off on them if you’re so inclined.  Those will be effective choices to come down from weight gain and maintain, but when you want to gain muscle, you need something where there’s a definite number that MUST be reached and the only way to do it is by eating big enough to recover and get there.  It’s also worth appreciating that the 4 programs I mentioned (DW, BtM, SS and Smolov) all BUILD to something at the end and have fixed lengths, vs something to be run indefinitely.  Having that sort of vector will guide weight gain well. >IF, for some reason, you’re simply not going to do that, then the approach with diet ALSO works with training: add stuff.  Take your root/base program and add in another day of activity (ideally conditioning, but lifting can also work).  Once you can recover from that, start adding in the “snacks” by getting some exercises BETWEEN your exercises.  This is a great time to bring in super/giant sets if you’re not already doing them, as it allows you to add in more work without adding in a whole bunch of time.  Going with the whole “snacks” thing, I tend to keep these movements on the smaller side, going for assistance work rather than adding in heavy compound work.  And you can keep adding on and on to giant sets.  I was running a 4 movement giant set on my press days of some sort of press, bodyweight dips, DB lateral raises and face pulls.  A lotta small movements will add up. >If you do this right, it’s never going to be a question of “am I gaining too much fat”, but “am I not eating enough to recover from my training.”  That’s a GOOD position to be in.  **AN ARGUMENT AGAINST LEAN BULKING** >Fat loss remains the easiest goal to achieve.  For proof of concept, think about how many people brag about losing absurd amounts of weight and contrast that with the amount of people that can brag about building large amounts of muscle. The fact remains that fat is far easier to lose than muscle is to gain.  I’ll discuss the easy way to lose fat when I discuss fat loss in general, but once we embrace this idea, it demonstrates why the goal of lean bulking is pretty goofy.  Endeavoring to remain lean at ALL times is purely some Instagram famous silliness with trainees thinking they need to be photoshoot ready at all times.  The truth is, so long as you don’t let yourself get wildly out of control with fat growth (which, if you use the above, you will not be able to do), getting to “lean enough for the summer” shape takes weeks rather than months. >But beyond that, lean bulking fails because it INHIBITS the trainee from being able to pursue training related goals and, in turn, substantial physical improvement.  As I wrote above: nutrition supports training, not the other way around.  So when trainees try to take on the approach of lean bulking by only having a small caloric surplus, they grant themselves the ability to only train slightly above their normal ability, if at all.  Substantial physical growth comes about as a result of substantial training phases, and without the recovery fuel necessary to pursue these phases, the growth simply isn’t going to happen.  It means that attempts to lean bulk are attempts at mediocrity, POSSIBLY adding some insignificant amount of muscle by training exactly as hard as one had before and adding a handful of calories on top of it.  But you’re also going to most likely add a small amount of fat too with that surplus, especially with such lack of training intensity: you’re just experiencing such small growth on BOTH ends that you’re not observing any real change in either direction. >Instead, when one trains hard enough to require a significant surplus to recover, one gets significant results in muscular growth, and can quickly trim away any excess fat before pursuing more growth.  Because, in truth, fat loss phases are like a vacation from weight gain phases, for fat loss is FAR easier.  I’ll explain in that section. **LOSING WEIGHT** > I have upset a LOT of people with the sentiment I’m about to share, but it’s the honest truth: fat loss is easy.  The reason being is that fat loss is about INactivity.  To GAIN weight, we had to keep doing.  We had to cook all the meals, EAT all the meals, typically clean up after the meals, do a LOT of training, etc etc.  It’s a very busy time.  For fat loss, what we do is…nothing.  It’s true: when you do nothing, you lose fat.  The real word for that is “starve”, but the point remains.  To lose fat, all we have to do is NOT eat. > What if you get hungry?  That’s fine: be hungry.  > Much like with weight gain, it’s about phasing things.  You don’t want to just suddenly cut out EVERYTHING you were doing when you were gaining weight, because what the hell are you going to do when weight loss stalls?  Instead, start bringing out the things that you brought in.  I do tend to cut the carbs out of the pre/post training meals first, just because they’re a quick kill and now I’ve greatly reduced carbs.  After that, you can either eliminate extra meals or the extra food at your meals, but either way it remains the same: phase things out AS NEEDED.  If you’re losing weight, keep doing what you’re doing until it doesn’t work, and then try to take away something else.  I keep protein high through the process, and will cut fats before I cut protein.  Look at leaner protein sources as needed and cut out the stuff that has extra junk associated with it. >It's simply a game of patience at this point.  The weight comes off as long as you’re consistent.  It IS worth noting that, for the first couple of weeks, you’re actually going to look worse than you were when you started.  When you’re at the peak of your weight gain, your muscles are full of glycogen and water and look very full.  When you start cutting that stuff away, your muscles are going to fall flat yet you won’t have lost enough actual weight to see any impact on your midsection of muscular definition, so you’re now just a smaller chubby dude, which is a bad look.  HOWEVER, if you stay the course, that sorts itself out.  Just quit looking at yourself in the mirror so much. **TRAINING WHILE LOSING WEIGHT** > As I wrote in the section on weight gain, with fat loss, we have to make the training match US.  It’s no secret that food is anabolic and a source of energy, and that when we have a lot of it we can accomplish great things.  HOWEVER, we can STILL do great things in a caloric deficit: we just have to be ready to adapt to the days when our energy is low.  That means that programs that employ some manner of auto-regulation are key here, while those that employ fixed sets and reps based off percentages aren’t going to be idea.  5/3/1 does a fantastic job of accounting for this, either by using anchor programs that allow for AMRAP sets (so it’s up to you on that particular day to determine how hard you push) OR programs wherein you can select your training max at the start based off how you are performing.  Brian Alsruhe’s “Darkhorse Program” has the trainee work up to a max for THAT DAY and then uses that max to determine percentage work.  Westside Barbell for Skinny Bastards, despite the name, is about working up to maxes for the day on both the max effort and repetition effort day.  The advanced program in Deep Water is perfectly suited for this. There are other programs out there like that as well: seek them out and use them intelligently.  The point is, whereas with weight gain we were training to build ourselves up, here we train to express all that strength we build.  >And as before with weight gain training, things get taken out during weight loss training.  We have less calories, so we have less recovery, so we can’t do as much.  Conditioning workouts can get reduced in terms of intensity, volume, or frequency.  Assistance exercises can be trimmed away.  Extra training days can vanish, etc.  Wait until you need to reduce training before you do: ride it out for as long as you can, but don’t hold on longer than you should, as  that’s going to cause you to burnout.  Thankfully, fat loss is a quick process, and once you are where you want to be you can either ride that out or immediately transition back to gaining weight again.","Very nice point about nutrition for training. I'm definitely guilty of thinking about it the other way around, because I've always had what my parents call a healthy appetite.",255

I'd become injured in March 2019, so I used 531 to build my squat and deadlift back up from around 50kg, while running the Murphs. Began Average to Savage around Feb of this year as part of the r/Weightroom program party. A bit more strong: [5x190kg deads](https://imgur.com/8vjVb6F), [14x160kg deads](https://imgur.com/a/mN7TZ6t) and [1x240kg Farmers Lift](https://imgur.com/25Gr1fb). This pic is from April, around halfway through the Av2Sav prog. Currently bw of 81kg/180lbs. 5’8 (172cm) I've worked hard, and I've worked consistently over the last 5 years. No HRT or steroinks. **EDITS** **Diet.** When I gave up alcohol in 1999, I replaced it with food. By the end of my thirties I had ballooned in weight and was wheezing at the top of the stairs. I began running, eating more healthily and lost a bunch of weight. At my leanest around 2016/17 I had cut out sugar, and was eating lots of salad, fish and meat, running in the morning and working out 3-4 times a week. 2018 I was still eating healthy, but had upped the cals with Wendlers recommendations for Building the Monolith (1.5 pound of ground beef a day and one dozen whole eggs a day. For six weeks). In 2019, using nSuns TDEE calculator, I lost weight while doing the Murphs, from 179lbs down to 163lbs at the lowest; then in November 2019 began eating whatever I liked. By May 2020 by the time I completed the Murph challenge I was back up to 185lbs. Since then, I have made a concerted effort to cut out snacks, add more running and cardio to my week, along with Av2Sav, and am back down to 180lbs as of today. **Running** This was the first thing I did. I was a wheezing, aching fatso. Around 2009 I'd fucking had enough. I decided to run to the park, but only made it to the end of the street, hacking and bent double. It was horrible, but I was sick of the fat slob I'd become, so I did it again the next day, and the day after that. A year later I'd completed a 10k, and a half marathon by 2012. I also remember I'd trapped a nerve and was experiencing blinding pain 3 or 4 times daily, and in a hotel gym purely by chance had a go at squatting, and somehow managed to fix this injury! I continued running to a lesser extent once I started working out. I've not run any road races since then, but did enter Survival of the Fittest 10-14km OCR 2015-2017. I came 39th out of 3000+ in 2017. In 2018, I completed Fan Dance - 24km Endurance Race up and down a mountain with a 20kg backpack.

hk4u7k,"**Background:** The day was Wednesday 2nd January 2019 - I purchased my first ever gym  membership and attended the gym for the first time in my entire life,  walking into this unknown with zero knowledge. Prior to this, I had been suffering from severe depression throughout my entire life for multiple  reasons such as being bullied, being skinny, experiencing racism and  all the rest of the insults that I had received. This almost lead me to  try and commit suicide because I just thought life wasn't worth living,  so basically the gym/nutrition has give me hope in my life. I had no  ambition or drive in my life to want to become a better version of  myself, but I won't bog you down too much with that as you're not here  for that, right? I work a full-time job for 40 hours per week, so I was always that person who  thought I never had time for the gym because I worked a full-time job. I  was infact mistaken, I just had to find the determination and  dedication to put into the gym to make it work out for me, I had to find  ways and solutions to be able to eat all the food I eat whilst working,  and also attending the gym and getting a good nights sleep. I  decided that it was time to change everything, it was time to change  how I viewed the world, how I viewed myself as a person and how I viewed  my life. I wanted to make something of myself and I wanted to be the  reason that many more people that are/have been in the same situation as  me can also change themselves for the better and improve little tiny  things in their lifestyles - I will be making my Instagram account  dedicated to fitness, healthy nutrition, exercises and overall having a  healthy lifestyle and keeping away from depression. **My Journey:** Weighing  in at a staggering VERY unhealthy weight of 49kg (108 lbs). To put this  into perspective, my BMI calculation was at the very end of the red  zone, suggesting I was very underweight and baring in mind I don't have  any eating disorders. The healthy weight for someone of my height  started from 56.7kg (125 lbs). I  walked into the gym having absolutely zero exercise, nutrition or gym  knowledge. I didn't have any friends who went to the gym, I didn't have  any family who I knew went to the gym so all I had was myself and the  internet. A personal trainer was out of the question to get me started  because I couldn't afford it. I remember it was also a very intimidating  experience for me as there was a lot of fairly muscular people working  out, and it always felt like everyone was watching me, the usual gym  beginners problems - of course no one was watching me, they were in the  gym for the same reason as myself. After  my first ever workout, I had DOMs for at least 5 days afterwards and  that put me off going back. Another thing that put me off was the amount  of eating I was doing (the only knowledge I had was to eat as much as  possible), I went from eating a packet of Doritos for my 8pm tea to  eating about 2500 calories. The diet seemed much harder than going the  actual gym itself because I wasn't use to eating so much food. I would  probably eat 2500 calories spread out across 2-3 days before I went to  the gym. Fast forward to attending  the gym for a whole month, and I started to see that the scales where  going up, so whatever I was doing was working. This was when I was  becoming serious about the gym and from that month onwards, I always set  myself targets to reach for all my exercises. Fast  forward 2-3 months into my journey and it was a weird feeling, I  started to become more comfortable in my own skin. I started to not care  what people thought about me out in public or inside the gym. One major  problem for me was my ego, I wanted to make it seem like I was lifting  heavy weight for people to see rather than for my own personal benefit,  which sacrificed my form on a lot of my exercises, but I eventually  overcome this problem after 6 months of my journey. My  breakfast included the likes of sausages, egg, bacon, tomatoes and  beans (I can't remember the exact macros as I never use to track my  food). For my lunch, I would eat a massive bowl(I mean massive, to the  point I kept gagging because I was so full) of egg fried rice. For my  tea (dinner, whatever you refer to it as) I would eat cooked chicken  thighs and I ate a lot of them, approx 800-1000 calories worth. For  snacks throughout the day, I would prepare sandwiches with ham and  turkey slices to eat. I also bought USN Anabolic Mass weight gainer  about 3-4 months in and had 1 shake per day. I was eating approx. 2500  calores. I use to prepare my food the day before so I was able to eat  them in work and then go to the gym in the evening. 6  months in, I started learning so much more about the gym, exercises and  nutrition from all the time I put into researching. I changed my  breakfast from a full English to Lasagne (I'm not kidding about this, I  ate Lasagne for breakfast for at least another 7 months). Although  Lasagne isn't that healthy, I found it was much better than eating  sausage and bacon every day. About 1 month into eating Lasagne, I  changed the beef mince to 2% fat turkey mince because that was  healthier, so the only unhealthy thing about it at this point was the  industrialised cream sauce and fatty cheese. For my snack, I use to eat a  little salad box including Kiwifruit. Lunch, I had 200g (dry) pasta  with Dolmio sauce. For another snack, I had 2 x pizza subs (not the  healthiest). For my tea I had chicken thighs still. *Breakfast: 816.15 cal* *Lunch: 1149 cal* *Dinner: 855 cal* *Shake: 564 cal* *Total Calories: 3384.15* *Protein: 267g* The  exercise I have struggled most with has definitely been bench press. My  ectomorph bodytype and long arms don't help in this exercise so it has  definitely been a struggled to get it where it is today. I'm really  striving for that 2 plate bench press though by the end of this year, at  least. Unfortunately I injured my  right bicep after a few months of training and that meant I couldn't do  arm workouts for approx. 6 months. I used the easy curl bar and sat  down on the bench/stool provided. I must of been squeezing my hands too  hard for my grip, whilst trying to straighten my arm out as much as  possible with a heavy weight. I must of trapped something or tear  something, but it took months to heal. I only just started training my  arms towards the beginning of this year so I feel as if they're very  underdeveloped at the moment. I also injuried my right knee area from  doing deadlifts a few months in, I've put that down to the fact I wasn't  very good with squats so my knee joint was very weak. It seemed to  subside after a few weeks, but it's still comes back occasionally so I'm  just careful with my weight. I  changed my diet up coming up to my 1 year gym anniversary. I cut out my  pizza subs and chicken thighs and replaced them with Quorn products.  They're meat-free processed foods, but I thought they were a little  healthier at least. After my first  year, I completely changed my diet and now my diet is super healthy and  contains as much unprocessed food as possible and easy digesting food. **New 2020 Diet:** Breakfast - Oat Protein Pancakes = 675.90 calories Lunch - Roast vegetables with rice inc olive oil = 812.14 calories Pre-workout Meal - Healthy Protein Smootie and a bowl of rice = 446.28 calories Dinner - Turkey Mince 2% fat with a gravy type liquid = 410.60 calories **Macros per day:** Calories: 2344.92 Protein: 171.40g Fat: 67.6g Carbs: 202.65g Sugar: 63.4g - mainly comes from the vegetables and fruit Water: 3.5 Litre Sleep: 8-9 hours Food Cost £50-70 per week **Routine:** Currently doing a 4-5 day workout week, although I know I need a new routine.

i5iibv,"[Before/Current](https://i.imgur.com/KJ97Hot.jpg) [Post workout pics](https://i.imgur.com/7GSlvYP.png) It’s been just over two years since I started my fitness journey, mostly powered by the inspirational posts here and in other fitsubreddits, so figured I would contribute in case it inspires someone else. (using a throwaway account since my main has identifying info) **Background:** I was pretty sedentary for most of my life, not really into sports or physical activity of any kind. As I was approaching 30 I could feel my body slowing down, and going to a physical checkup made me a bit worried with my overall health especially with potential heart and diabetic genetics. So in early 2018 I decided to make a change. **False start:** I didn’t want to join a gym because I didn’t want to embarrass myself, so I started just by walking and occasionally jogging. Also bought myself a pull up bar and some bands. I don’t even know why I got a pull up bar because I didn’t even know how to train for it (although it would come in handy during a future quarantine). This wasn’t very helpful as I lacked the discipline and commitment to do this myself. After a few months of going no where, (plus some life changes) I decided to sign up with a personal trainer/gym. **Start:** I didn’t really do much research on gyms/trainers, I just wanted to start, so I found a nearby gym that had good enough reviews and signed up for 3 months. Figured paying money for a trainer was good motivation to keep going. I lucked out because the trainer I was assigned was pretty good at working with my fitness level. For the first month or so it was mostly cardio (treadmill walking) and bodyweight training, with some dumbbell work thrown in (starting at like 8lbs) 3 days a week. I’m glad it was a slow start because in the first two weeks there were multiple times that I ended up puking during the workout (I was pretty unfit). This was in July (and when the before pic was taken). **3 months in:** They do say it gets easier, and after the first month I wasn’t feeling as sick during workouts and I was able to go on a regular basis. I never missed a day, and I started doing walking/jogging on the off days. 3 months in I did notice a major change in mindset; I no longer had to force myself to go to the gym, I started going on autopilot. **Diet:** My trainer had me go on an intermittent fasting diet at the start, and we were doing weekly weigh-ins. I lost about 30 pounds in the first 3 months. I hated the diet because I thought eating healthy meant eating bland. I didn’t fully commit to what he laid out, but I was able to commit to the fasting, which definitely helped with the weight loss. Around November, I started keeping track of my weight and started messing around with what I ate. I used an app called [fitmencook](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fit-men-cook-healthy-recipes/id980368562) which allowed me to make more interesting meals, and I used the calories in that to get a rough sense for how many calories I was consuming with each meal. It probably wasn’t very accurate but I was continuing to lose weight so I didn’t care too much about the accuracy. [Weight loss graph](https://i.imgur.com/eSc13zf.jpg) (there’s a glitch and the year is shown as 2018 throughout for some reason) **7 months in:** I was feeling pretty great with my overall health, and even more impressed that I was able to commit to working out on a regular basis. However, paying for a trainer is not cheap, and it wasn’t something I could continue to do long term. But by then I was almost doing things by myself anyways. I knew what areas would be worked on each day, and what sort of exercises needed to be done, so figured it was time to move on. During the last month with the trainer I actually asked him to show me use of barbell exercises. During this month I signed up for a commercial gym and started going two days a week. So I was now working out 5 days a week. **April through November 2019:** I started following the [PHUL](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout) routine for a month or two and then followed with a [PHAT](http://simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html) routine after that, because I enjoyed doing SOMEthing everyday of the week (weekends was for complete relaxation) Both routines are great, but I realized that I might be missing something in how I was progressing because I was increasing weight whenever I felt like it, and my form was suffering because of it. Chose both routines because they came recommended in the wiki; I just wanted something that told me exactly what to do without me having to overthink things. **November 2019 through Mar 2020:** After hearing about nSuns on reddit I decided to try it out. I never wanted to attempt it because It seemed like a LOT of volume, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted spend more than an hour at the gym. However having the progression built in was pretty helpful, plus really helped me focus on my form. I did end up spending more than an hour just doing weights, I had stopped running or doing any form of cardio entirely. The values below are calculated from the [nSuns app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nsuns-5-3-1/id1265494052) and I never actually attempted my maxes, which is fine because gaining a lot of strength was not a huge priority for me. I also ran into some knee trouble, and basically stopped doing squats starting in January. * Bench: 115 > 180 * Deadlift 220 > 295 * OHP 80 > 120 * Squat 150 > 215 [nSuns progression graph](https://i.imgur.com/6knUa9j.jpg) (zoomed in to show the values, so November is cut off) **Quarantine:** Once quarantine started I started doing the [recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_strength_work_.2840-60_minutes.29) from r/bodyweightfitness. I think the pull up bar was the best accidental purchase I made, because it came in REAL handy during this time. I also got myself a pair of rings which I hung off the pull up bar to do things like rows. Going to purchase some dumbbells+belt so I can continue to increase my weighted pull-ups and use it for things like curls. I started doing some skill stuff like L-sits and handstands. I also got back into running and finished the [C25K](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/c25k-5k-trainer/id485971733) app. Then graduated to [C210K](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/10k-trainer-by-c25k/id511600311) and now I’m working on the 13.1 app. Workout schedule: * M/W/F(mornings) - Recommended routine * T/T/S (mornings) - Running 5, 2, 10+ miles and focusing on increasing mileage * Daily (evenings) - Stretching/yoga in the evenings * Sunday - Rest Some current achievements: * \~10 weighted pull-ups (+35lbs using a backpack filed with books) * \~10 pseudo planche pushups * \~10 tucked ring rows * \~2 sec kickup handstand (near a wall rather than completely freestanding) * \~20 sec L-sit * 12mi run in about two hours (9.50min/mi) **Quarantine diet:** Almost completely cut out eating out (for obvious reasons) so I started using [MyfitnessPal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myfitnesspal/id341232718) to keep track of calories and to hit my protein goal (currently maintaining at 2000 calories with a protein goal of 126g). The recipes feature in MFP was a game changer when I discovered it as it was helpful when I started experimenting with different recipes. I do not track on the weekends, but I don’t necessarily go overboard either. Sticking to the calorie goal has intuitive taught me how much food I should be consuming, plus I can be flexible if I do end up eating out indulging in some treats. **What’s next:** The initial goal was losing weight, but currently it’s more about sticking to the routine and maintaining a balanced lifestyle. I never thought I would ever have the look of my current body. Not that it’s that impressive compared to what I’ve seen on here, but definitely something I’m happy with, and it's something I can probably maintain going forward. Having some goals is helpful to making progress (Want to do things like planche, levers, handstand walks…). Once gyms open up again in my area I will prob do a 3 day full body routine to start and continue with the running which I actually sort of enjoy now. **Takeaways:** * Getting into the habit is more important than waiting for motivation. Figure out what can get you started into a routine. * If the goal is general fitness/weight-loss, then the exact routine, macros, accessories…etc don’t matter all that much as long as you do SOMETHING. I think people (including myself early on) tend to overthink this. * Start small, start slow; give your body time to adapt. The weight, the speed, the intensity can increase over time. * Accurately tracking calories is important for weight loss, especially after the initial drop of just eating less. Those 1tbsp of oil (\~120 calories) do add up over time. **Thanks for reading and happy to answer any questions!**","Great read and even better progress! Nothing to comment aside from what you already stated multiple times which is to **be consistent**. Very, very hard starting out but I started working out the same way you did - slowly. Started with jogging so I can feel how exercise impacted my body as to not overwork myself, and then gradually transitioned to lifting and jogging on off days to keep the momentum going. Working out isn't fun at first, but make it past the first month once it's already been incorporated into your daily routine and you'll fall in love with it. Thanks again OP for the useful information. I hope this helps those who may be struggling to find motivation.",107
jm6paq,"**Summary** European obese person with a broken pituitary gets his shit together at 25YO, goes through medically induced puberty, opens the door of a gym and never looks back. **Introduction & background** Hello fellow fitness lovers, I’ve been eager to share this transformation with you guys. This is probably not going to be your typical transformation post, but I really hope you will get something out of it. It all started just about 6 years ago when I opened the door of a gym for the very first time. I was fat, sick, miserable, and I had no idea that opening that door would mean so much to me. See I was 25 years old at that time, yet I was trapped in the body of a 13-year-old. Due to complications at birth part of my brain commanding the hormones was damaged and I hadn’t been through puberty yet. My body was a wreck and my mind was a mental prison. Fitness gave me a purpose and saved my life; it was exactly the tool I needed and that’s what ill focus on in this post. **Starting stats** Age: 25 105KG BF: 35%+ 188cm **Stats now** Age: 31 90KG BF: south of 15% (or so I hope ) **Before and after picture** [https://imgur.com/U6zIUsQ](https://imgur.com/U6zIUsQ) Left age 25, right age 31 I started my transformation at 105 kilos but as I had never really taken a shirtless picture for the before/after I’m using my first shirtless selfie just about a year in. Back then I had already lost 20 kilos at the gym and was about to start HRT. When I started my transformation, this was my physique with clothes: [https://imgur.com/F1mzqcp](https://imgur.com/F1mzqcp) Face gains:  [https://imgur.com/h9UzUAn](https://imgur.com/h9UzUAn) Kept some loose skin unfortunately, nothing I can do about it so I won’t dwell on it:  [https://imgur.com/k7FxaF5](https://imgur.com/k7FxaF5) Full album (warning: there is a gore picture of an injury in this album): [https://imgur.com/a/iA5m1iE](https://imgur.com/a/iA5m1iE) **Exercise** *Situation before* I started out at 105 kg and almost no muscle at all. I couldn’t do a bodyweight squat without hurting my knees and I couldn’t bench the bar. My body was a wreck due to hormonal deficiencies and any exercise would leave me in pain for almost a week after (even hiking). I have to be honest due to being bullied at school I hated sport. ‘If only I knew then what I know now’. Knowledge is power, well when I started out, I didn’t know anything about training, like literally 0, I had to learn everything from scratch. The last time I exercised was in school and I was always last. Other than the owner of my first gym showing me 2-3 things I never had a coach. At the beginning weight loss was my main concern. I lost 20 kilos doing simple cardio on the elliptical in the gym 3 times per week. I only started lifting after about a year and injured myself quite quickly being an idiot looking at what others were doing. (wrists, shoulders, elbows, knees, fingers, everything that moves has gone through injury) I won’t go into details but once I started hormonal replacement therapy (I have to replace 5 crucial hormones my body isn’t making) things started clicking for me. *Things I wish I knew before starting out:* * Warming up is crucial * Spot-reduction is a myth: you can’t just burn fat where you want. Abs are 90% kitchen. * Don’t listen to ‘Bro science’: You wouldn’t believe all the s\*\*\* I heard in the gym over the years * Mind muscle connection is a thing * Having a workout plan is essential * Ego lifting doesn’t get you anything except injuries * Form, this might be the most important one. Learning how to perform an exercise properly. In the beginning I looked at others in the gym which is utterly idiotic, but I didn’t know better. * My first research on proper form were Scott Herman’s videos on YouTube. Also watched a lot of form-check posts on this sub and people’s feedback. * Tracking lifts * Big – bigger – biggest, no one gives a damn, were all there to work on ourselves and that’s what matters. I was way too self-conscious going to the gym in the beginning * Under resting: sleep and rest periods are essential To be honest with you guys I have been the perfect newbie/‘fuckaroundits’ example for a long time, too long. . . I could write books about mistakes I made but let’s focus on what I do now. *What I do now:* I have tried a lot of different workout programs from [bodybuilding.com](https://bodybuilding.com) and Reddit. I stuck to “shortcut to size” and “shortcut to shred” from Jim Stoppani for quite some time, but the one I found that suits me the most now is a simple PPL split from Reddit. I do 3 days on, 1 day off. Things started getting better and better since I’m lurking on this sub. I am training in 3 different gyms every week due to my current lifestyle and I love alternating between dumbbells, barbells and machines for the same movement pattern. Due to going to commercial gyms I often have to change the order of my exercises and improvise. I’m not the kind of guy that waits 15 minutes next to a bench press. My typical split: **Push day** (Chest, shoulders, triceps) 4 sets of bench press with dumbbells, machine or bar 4 sets of incline or decline press (I love the decline) 3 to 4 sets of Fly’s 4 sets of shoulder press or military press 3 sets Lateral raises 3 to 4 sets of triceps pressdown / skullcrushers / triceps machine **Pull day** (back & biceps) 4 sets of lateral pulldowns 4 sets of rows (one arm / V-bar/ dumbbell / machine) I would love to master the bent over rows but they always spark lower back pain so I need to work on that 3 to 4 sets of pull ups (mostly on assisted machine even if I don’t use any weight – I’m still scared of making a fool out of myself doing it at the pulley) 3 sets of straight arm pulldowns 4 sets Curls with dumbells / barbell / cable **Leg day** (the 2 limbs I can’t maneuver for the rest of the week) 4 sets of squats or 4 to 7 sets of leg press (as I do my legs every 4 days, I like to alternate between starting with squats or leg press) 4 sets of leg extensions 3 to 4 sets of leg curls / seated leg curls depending on gym 4 sets of 20 lunges (usually without any weight) I really should incorporate straight leg deadlifts for my hamstrings but I always hurt my lower back with this, definitely a point I should work on. I generally work in the 8-12 range but like to change things up or down from time to time. I drop set on the last set of a muscle group. **Some numbers** Bench-press: 4 sets of 10x40kg with dumbbells. Started with 12kg hurting my shoulders thanks to bad form. Leg-press: up to 6 plates on each side, depends on the machine. Different from gym to gym. Started with empty machine. Squat: 4 sets of 14x100kg. I didn’t do squats or proper leg days until 3 years ago. Started with the bar. Overhead press: Deadlift: got arrogant at 140kg and injured my lower back a while ago so for now I’m not deadlifting and I have to say I don’t miss it at all. I know my numbers are weak, but I came from not being able to walk on this earth pain-free. I had DOMS from carrying a grocery bag home. If somebody had told me that someday I would hold a 40kg dumbbell over my chest or 100kg on my back I would never have believed it. I do not test 1RM because I’m scared of injury. Perhaps that is a mistake? You tell me. **Diet** *Situation before* I was an overweight person with very little food know-how at the time. I never really ate that bad, but because I had a completely under working thyroid and I wasn’t exercising at all the weight kept piling on. I always skipped breakfast and mostly ate a sandwich at lunch and the biggest meal of the day in the evening. I gained a lot of weight in my twenties as I was drinking my problems away, which I’m not proud of.. When I started fitness, I didn’t know how to fuel my body properly; in other words, I knew jack shit about nutrition. At the beginning I was the perfect moron eating salads and spending my time on the elliptical. *Things I wish I knew before starting out:* * My first year of cardio only I was severely under-eating * Not tracking my calories:  once I did, I notice that my estimation was wrong by 1000 calories. * Overeating while bulking:  there is absolutely no point in gaining 30 pounds in a couple of months of which 5 are probably muscle and the rest fat. A mistake I seem to repeat every time I bulk. Check out some befores and afters: [https://imgur.com/zonII1f](https://imgur.com/zonII1f) * Eating fat is necessary to live * Salt isn’t the enemy, neither are carbs *What I do now:* I track everything in Myfitnesspal. When bulking I’ll eat about 3500 calories (380C 100F 235P). Cutting I’ll drop to 2300-2500 calories, mostly dropping carbs while maintaining high protein. What I eat? Mostly my staple consists of oats, eggs, chicken & fish, pasta (pasta is life for me), Greek yogurt, olive oil, avocadoes, nuts, fresh fruit, vegetables and last but not least popcorn (thanks Greg). My food is pretty much tasteless and boring, but it works. Once a week I take my girl out to eat something good or we cook something special at home where I’m not counting. Here is a sample of what a day of eating looks like for me (maintaining now):  [https://imgur.com/5ylTiWx](https://imgur.com/5ylTiWx) Boring yes, but it works. *Supplements?* Whey isolate, creatine only when bulking, BCAA’s only during leg days for that placebo effect, animal cuts at the end of a cut and vitamins all year round. PWO on push & pull days. **Injury** I’ll keep it short, one advice I can give anyone: do not get sloppy at the gym and re-rack your weights between sets if you don’t use them anymore. I learned this the hard way and almost lost a finger when I reached muscle-failure bench-pressing with dumbbells. I dropped the dumbbell right on top of another one next to my bench and my middle finger was at the wrong place at the wrong time (warning: the picture is quite gore) : [https://imgur.com/lXb2f0n](https://imgur.com/lXb2f0n) It took time but I recovered quite well, still can’t use that finger for everything though .. *Edit:* thank you for all your beautiful messages. As some have been asking, I uploaded an update of my finger. (Please don't click on it if you are sensible to these kinds of images. My iphone thinks it's a sausage and put it automatically in food album just to give you an idea) [https://imgur.com/a/60wGX7G](https://imgur.com/a/60wGX7G) **Bonus: check out my workout gear during lockdown:**  [https://imgur.com/26gI9FV](https://imgur.com/26gI9FV) I was one of the lucky ones as I had a garden at my disposal with a wooden bench, some sandbags and flower pots. Yes,  flower pots, with some bricks in there and my creative/moron spirit I was able to do a lot. Doesn’t look like much, but trust me when you’re grieving and you’re not allowed to leave the house, getting that garden pump under your neighbor’s eyes feels like heaven. I’ll never stop lifting no matter what, it became like therapy for me and it’s a necessity for my mental and physical health. **Final word** I forged someone I never thought would see daylight in the gym. Amidst the chaos of life, it has been my ally and I know for a lot of you out there it’s the same. Thank you for reading this and remember, it’s you versus you, you are the hero of your own story in there. As I said at the beginning, this transformation was partly possible thanks to hormonal replacement therapy (not blasting!) Should someone want to know more about my HRT journey, I have a detailed post on r/testosterone: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/go46w6/5\_year\_trt\_transformation\_thanks\_to\_this\_sub/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/go46w6/5_year_trt_transformation_thanks_to_this_sub/) TY","Every time I think I've seen the most pathetic iteration of Reddit's obsession with ""what's natural"", some more people decide to step up to the plate and break the record. Let me tell you how much nobody in the fucking world cares to hear your opinion about how someone who is being **medically treated for hormone deficiency** ""counts"" as ""being on gear"", whether or not that person's progress is still valid because their natural range levels of testosterone came from their balls or a vial, or anything else of that nature.

m3hs84,"Before/after picture: [Imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/zIzvkvL) ## Body Stats  Starting height/weight/age: 5'9"" / 115 lbs / 19 Ending height/weight/age: 5'9"" / 148 lbs / 21 (elapsed time: 16 months) ## Goal and initial steps Some important context:  I have a rare autoimmune disorder, but without going too much into detail basically I can eat only about ten foods. Everything else sends me into anaphylaxis. This makes gaining weight difficult since I basically have to eat huge amounts of the exact same food over and over, no variety, in order to get a caloric surplus. I'm giving this little bit of context because the diet will seem very strange without it haha. I take certain vitamins/supplements to make up for what I can't get from my food. Despite these restrictions, I decided I wanted to be healthier. There wasn't really anything that made it impossible for me to not be underweight, it was just harder. I started trying to turn stuff around in January, but only gained about 10 lbs from January 2020 to July 2020. This is entirely because I wasn't eating enough--only about 2800 calories a day. August 1st 2020, I started tracking my calories using a spreadsheet and keeping track of my weight, and I turned up the amount I was eating per day to around 3300-3500 calories, with a 40/30/30 protein/fat/carbs split. I chose this daily calorie goal because I wanted to gain about 1.5-2 lbs a week to hit a goal of 150 lbs. I also began working out from home 5 days a week (previously I was hitting the gym 2-3 days a week). This combo worked. From August 1st 2020 to October 1st 2020, I went from 125 to 140 lbs! After that, I started gaining slower, but I still progressed, and by February 2021 was 148 lbs, just 2 lbs shy of my 150 lb goal. Before I get into specifics, if you take away one thing from what I learned, let it be this: **if you think you're eating enough, eat more.**  ## Diet  Day A:  * Breakfast: 1 cup chicken, 3 servings cereal, 1-2 apples  * First lunch: fried chicken (1.5 lbs), french fries (3 heads of potato), 2 cucumbers  * Second lunch: 1.5 cup cold salmon, 3 servings cereal, 1 apple, 2 cucumbers  * Dinner: 1 cup chicken, 3 servings cereal, 1 apple Day B:   * Breakfast: 1 cup chicken, 3 servings cereal, 1-2 apples  * First lunch: 2 cups hot salmon, 3 servings cereal, 1 head mashed potatos, 2 cucumbers  * Second lunch: 1 whole hen, 3 servings cereal, 1 head mashed potatos, 2 cucumbers  * Dinner: 1 cup chicken, 3 servings cereal, 1/2 head mashed potatos I do Day A 4-5 times a week and Day B 2-3 times a week. ## Workout routine Here's how I workout: All I use are two sets of dumbbells: 2 five pounders and 2 30 pounders. This is because I am pretty weak so 30 lbs is enough to hit my bigger muscles and the five pounders are enough to hit my weaker muscles.  NB: XxY = X sets of Y reps Day A: * Very wide pushups: 5x15 * Adjusted bicep curls: 5x12 (I grip the 30 lb weight with both hands, pull my elbows towards my body, and curl) * Clap pushups: 3x10 (push up hard, clap before catching yourself on the way down) * Bicep curls: 4x(20 reps, 16, 14, and 10 reps) * Triangle pushups: 4x10 * Tricep press: 5x10 * Shuffle pushup: 3x8 * Plank: 3x30 seconds Day B:  * Calf raises: 5x20 (hold 30 lbs in each hand) * Dumbbell standing row: 5x10 * Goblet squats: 5x10 * Dumbbell overhead press: 3x10 * Weighted Russian twists: 5x20 (holding both 5lb weights close to my chest) * Front shoulder raise: 5x10 (holding both 5lb weights in one hand for each shoulder) * Plank: 3x30 seconds * Lateral shoulder raise: 5x10 (holding both 5 lb weights in one hand for each shoulder) * Weighted crunches: 3x10 (holding 30 lb weight on my chest) NB: on Day B, I do 1x20 set of shrugs in between each exercise.  I raise the volume as I get stronger, but will definitely be going back to the gym once I get the COVID vaccine. I do Day A MoWeFri and Day B TuThu. ## What's next I want to shoot for 160 lbs next. I'm gaining a lot slower than I was at first, but I'm enjoying the challenge. I'd also like to develop my lower and upper back more, something that was pretty hard for me to do from home. Thanks for reading!","Wait, you ate 4 whole cucumbers a day?",765
sn1wh,"I was at a Coolio concert last night.  At the end of gangster paradise hes standing right in front of me on a speaker. As the music faded he then slammed a quarter of a patron bottle and put his rings in his pocket.  The whole time I'm watching this thinking wtf is he gonna do?  Next thing I see is his body flying towards me.  I caught him on my right shoulder with each thigh in hand.  The momentum of him falling pushed me down into the position I am at when I am at the bottom of a squat rep.  Being drunk I am surprised we didn't just tip over but somehow my balance was stable.  I then finished the squat rep of Coolio and vaulted him behind me to the rest of the crowd and he crowd surfed away.  I then yelled ""this is what I have been training for"" and went and got a beer. TLDR: I squatted coolio","Bro, you gonna re-rack that Coolio now that you're done with it?",1751
