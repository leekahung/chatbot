3eret9,"I signed an open letter earlier this year imploring researchers to balance the benefits of AI with the risks. The letter acknowledges that AI might one day help eradicate disease and poverty, but it also puts the onus on scientists at the forefront of this technology to keep the human factor front and center of their innovations. I'm part of a campaign enabled by Nokia and hope you will join the conversation on http://www.wired.com/maketechhuman. Learn more about my foundation here: http://stephenhawkingfoundation.org/    Due to the fact that I will be answering questions at my own pace, working with the moderators of /r/Science we are opening this thread up in advance to gather your questions.    My goal will be to answer as many of the questions you submit as possible over the coming weeks. I appreciate all of your understanding, and taking the time to ask me your questions.  **Moderator Note** This AMA will be run differently due to the constraints of Professor Hawking.  The AMA will be in two parts, today we with gather questions.  Please post your questions and vote on your favorite questions, from these questions Professor Hawking will select which ones he feels he can give answers to.   Once the answers have been written, we, the mods, will cut and paste the answers into this AMA and post a link to the AMA in /r/science so that people can re-visit the AMA and read his answers in the proper context.  The date for this is undecided, as it depends on several factors.   Professor Hawking is a guest of /r/science and has volunteered to answer questions; please treat him with due respect. **Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.** If you have scientific expertise, please verify this with our moderators by getting your account flaired with the appropriate title.

6erjjd,"Hello everyone, Earlier today [President Trump announced his intention to exit the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-announce-us-will-exit-paris-climate-deal/2017/06/01/fbcb0196-46da-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab_story.html?). While r/science ~~does not take a stance on political issues~~ *generally strives not to take a political stance, this issue is so exceptional and is heavily science-related that we made an exception*. We feel the need to reaffirm our commitment to solid science, and in that regard we strongly disagree with these actions. [Climate change is real](https://climate.nasa.gov/) and it's happening right now. [There is still time left to do something about it](https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/index.htm), but this requires the actions of all people of the world.  We decided to create this thread to welcome discussion and questions from the users about climate change and the Paris Agreement. We will be moderating this thread [less heavily than we normally do](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules), but we still ask that you be civil and respectful in the comments.  Comments that go against established science must include **peer-reviewed** citations, and egregious dismissals may result in bans. EDIT: Please note the edits above in italics.  r/askscience is [also holding a megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6ertms/askscience_megathread_climate_change/) on this issue. Feel free to ask questions there as well.","The Conservative argument for pulling out of the Paris agreement is that: - it will have a modest, mostly symbolic impact of surface temperatures (less than 2 degrees if fully implemented) - it will cost tax US taxpayers trillions - it will be harmful for the US economy > It would result in increased U.S. electricity expenditures of 15-20 percent over the next decade, 400,000 fewer American jobs, a total income loss of over $30,000 for an American family of four, and a loss of over $2.5 trillion in U.S. gross domestic product. (per Heritage Foundation) How valid are these complaints?",8647
7e1jo1,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.    Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.  This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA.   This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6). In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).  What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it. Edit: There is an official White House petition you can sign to express your opposition: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/opposition-taxation-graduate-student-tuition-waivers-and-remissions Aslo: https://medium.com/@avandervort/an-open-letter-to-the-senate-concerning-h-r-1-and-the-graduate-student-tax-provision-5ff7ace9262d  ","Your post describes my situation, I am a graduate student who came back to the US for my studies. I'm already in a very tight situation financially so if this tax reform passes I'm going to have no choice but to turn around and go back to Germany. I will essentially be forced out of my own country.",16301
