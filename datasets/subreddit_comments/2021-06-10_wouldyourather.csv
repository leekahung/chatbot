e4xrj9,"Being airborne is the only requirement for taking no fall damage. Any following damage caused by the fall is also nullified, until the fall and consequences of the fall are finished. So falling off a cliff and tumbling the rest of the way will cause you no harm. Being launched into, or jumping into a moving object such as a car will harm you, but the fall will not. Entering the atmosphere is also falling, you will not burn, and diving headfirst from orbit will not cause any pain or injury. The only requirement is that you must be airborne before falling. Infinite sprint is just that: infinite sprint. Jogging does not count and running does not count, you must be sprinting for infinite stamina to activate. You will not tire, you will not sweat, it will not damage your bones or muscles, it will not damage your organs whatsoever, and breathing is not a factor nor will it be hard to breathe during infinite sprint. Sprinting barefoot will not damage your skin or be painful, or form callus. Hydration, food, and sleep is also not needed during infinite sprint.",Infinite sprint. I think I would benefit from that better and also I'd find more practical uses in my daily life for it than no fall damage.,258

lh1tky,"**PART 1: The Asteroid (Prologue)** There is an impending asteroid on its way to strike the earth. It's large enough that if it collides, the earth will be destroyed. A team of volunteers are gathering to combat the asteroid. They are willing to sacrifice their lives to save the planet by launching a barrage of rockets, flown by themselves, into the asteroid to destroy it. If they succeed, they will be the only casualties and billions will be saved. They will be regarded as heroes and their family will be taken care of for generations to come. If they do not succeed, everyone left on Earth will die. There is another group of people who are remaining on the planet, they will only survive if there are enough volunteers to destroy the asteroid. Once the Earth stabilizes after a few years, humanity will rebuild and life will go on as it did prior to the asteroid. The final group of people are planning to escape the planet altogether, and survive on a luxurious space station until they find a new planet to inhabit. Those who make it on board are guaranteed to survive, and will live the rest of their lives in luxury. Seating on the planetary escape pods is limited, however, and they will only get a seat if more people choose to remain on earth than escape. If there is no seating available, they will be unknowingly added to the group who are sacrificing themselves, and sent into space to their doom (for the betterment of mankind, you know). &#x200B; 1.

I know a lot of people want to erase their own memories of a beloved game, show or movie, but the thing about that is - will the current you appreciate this experience as much as the old you did, before you erased your own memories of it? The answer is very likely “no,” and not just because you’re older, but your situation may be different, your views may be different from how they were then. You may have played better games mechanically, or can’t look past the games gameplay or graphics. For the shows and movies, maybe they have some tropes you’ve seen before in other stuff and you can see it all coming, so it doesn’t impact you the way it did the “first” time you watched it, before the erasure. Edit: Heck, even trying to forget your past traumas could change who you are. Maybe the paranoia or fears don’t go away, but now you don’t even know why you have them because you erased your own memory. What happens when someone you’ve told about it before brings it up?

misa14,"Respawning - If you die, your body makes a comical death animation and you fall through the floor. After a day, you will respawn at the last place you slept. Your body will be identical to the body you had at the start of the day you died; including clothing. If you died from a disease, you will respawn cured of the disease. You have a total of five lives. XP System - You gain experience points from common tasks, picking locks, completing errands/quests for people and killing creatures. The XP scales with the difficulty of each option. When you have gained enough XP, you will level-up with an audible sound effect ringing through your current area. With that level up, you will gain skill points which you can invest in certain attributes (strength, intelligence, vitality, agility, charisma, luck, wisdom). Inventory - You have a pocket dimension where you can put any object or item that you would to be able to lift into. The inventory can hold up to 1000 (2204) kg of objects. The objects do not age while in the inventory. While your hands are empty, you can think of something in your inventory and it will appear into them. Nothing alive (besides plants) can be put into your inventory. When putting things into your inventory or taking it out, a bag ruffling sound originates from you. Status Hud - You have a HUD that shows both your health, hunger, thirst and stamina bar. The HUD will also show any status effects that are affecting you (poison, disease, tiredness, etc.) When you take damage, instead of your body feeling pain or showing physical damage, it will take health off your health bar. Your max health can increase by natural means like eating healthier, exercising, or living a healthy lifestyle. Your health bar naturally regenerates after you have not taken damage for a minute. Once your health bar reaches zero, you die. You may also dismiss your HUD from your vision at anytime and make it appear again. When you look at an item, a small description appears detailing what the item is, how much its worth and its attributes. If people look into your eyes, they can see the HUD while it is active. Edit: Status Bar was missing a few features.

n1bjn8,"A demon of unknown power approaches you. He offers you a choice between four pairs of eyes. The catch being that the eyes are always active. They are invulnerable and cannot be blinded/taken out in any way. The only time they close is when you blink or fall asleep. Eyes of Law: Whenever anyone makes a statement directed to you or answers a question from you, a glowing, red false or a glowing, green truth appears over their head depending on whether its true or false. Any statement that is a guess instead of an actual answer from their knowledge will appear as false; even if it is true. Ex: You try asking someone how to solve the world economy. If they make a bunch of guesses, all of them will appear false even if they guess correctly. If they actually knew the answer and they say it, it will appear true. Eyes of the Future and Present: Your vision is perfectly split in two. Your most dominant eye always sees the present while your non-dominant eye sees the future. The future it shows will always be of the decision you are most likely to make next. You receive no sound from the future as it is only your eyes that have changed. Ex: You are thinking of showing someone your hand in poker; their reaction will appear on your least dominant eye's vision if you do it in 15 seconds. Eyes of Versatility: You can mimic the eyes of any creature you have touched before; scaled up to the size of a pair of human eyes. Your vision is always a perfect example of what that creatures view of the world would be. Your eyes can never be human again and when you get these eyes, it will start off as a random pair of eyes from a creature you have touched before. Ex: You touched a cat before and think about wanting their vision, your vision changes to that of a cat's. Eyes of Death: Any living creature you look at directly will have a counter above their head. If they don't have a head, it will hover over the center point of their body. It will represent how much time they have before they die. The counter is represented like this: YEARS-DAYS-HOURS-MINUTES-SECONDS. The font of the counter will always be the font they find most pleasant. If a creature doesn't know what a font is, it will just be in your favorite font. You cannot see your own death counter. Ex: You go to see your parents, you will see their timer. [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/n1bjn8)",This is what WYR is about this is an amazing question,589

nhibu1, [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nhibu1),"The average human lives 692,040 hours. This is if they live to be 79 years old. Divide that by two and you have 346,020 x 100 = 34,602,000. So you’d earn that much money from simply being alive.  On the other hand, the average person walks 7.5k a day. For 80 years, that’s 216,262,500. But what if you walked more than 7.5k a day or ran marathons? The average steps in a marathon is 39,733 steps. Depending on how fast you are and your stride, it can go up to 52k or down to 28k steps. Let’s stick to 39k.  You’d have to run 887 marathons to make it to 34 million. The most marathons ran in a year, was 105. So basically almost 9 years to make it 34 million, however, that’s a world record. Let’s keep it simple at say... 30 per year. That’s still 29, basically 30 years of marathons. That’s on top of training and normal traveling.  Even if you didn’t run marathons, you’d earn more money walking than you would by simply being paid $100 every two hours, by the age of 40.  Walking is the better choice for those that can walk. However the $100 every two hours is more than enough to fulfill your needs, plus, you wouldn’t have to be active. With there being 8760 hours in a year, and you being paid 100 every two hours. That’s 438,000 dollars a year. More than enough.",1045
