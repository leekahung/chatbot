1z7jnu,"On a couple other subs there's been a couple discussions recently about songs that work as good introductions into different genres. I thought this might be a good topic for conversation, as well as a way to toss around some recommendations. So, what makes a song a good introduction to a genre? What genres do you just not seem to be able to find an entryway to? What helped you expand your musical horizons?  Edit: As a note, this discussion, as has been pointed out by the mods, has a real risk of becoming a list post. So be sure to include why you chose any song you list as a good entryway to a genre and work to foster discussion.","To help kick the discussion off some, I wrote up a list of songs that I felt make good entryways into different genres for another sub. It's a little self-indulgent, I'll admit, but here's the full list: Edit: At the suggestion of the mods, I've added details about the genre and why I picked the track. This is a work in progress. Hope to wrap it up tonight. Edit: Done, finally. Not adding any more, though I easily could do this all night. I'm a tired person. Thank you for the many, many responses and the gold. Also, credit to some lovely people who made playlists for this: /u/moethebartender made a YouTube [playlist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WPCBieSESI&list=PLQfHSmbuHssUHx8psBTG8bvuZLlWhZqA-) /u/TJKoury made one for [Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/#!/playlist/CoffeeZombie+Intro+Playlist/95754014) **Classic Jazz**: Louis Armstrong - [""West End Blues""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WPCBieSESI) This is one of Armstrong's most relevant recordings, featuring one of the most impassioned trumpet solos of a long and influential career. Armstrong is a major locus for where Dixieland jazz, ragtime, blues and a broad range of pop influences all meet and form what we think of as jazz, and he synthesizes all that while remaining wholly accessible. **BeBop**: Charlie Parker - [""Koko""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okrNwE6GI70) Charlie Parker was one of the most mercurial figures in popular music, a brilliant musician who galvanized jazz with his powerful, energetic soloing. This track is one of his best and a great introduction into the more free-form, abstract music that characterized bebop, a sound that broke jazz from the stale swing era. It includes a lot of what made this music powerful, with complex melodic lines and virtuoso solos. **Modal Jazz**: Miles Davis - [""So What""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEC8nqT6Rrk) Davis was a figure who seemed able to completely reinvent jazz every decade or so, causing revolutions with bebop, modal jazz, fusion and big band style jazz. This track is the opening from *Kind of Blue*, an album that is a guidebook to modal jazz, and is widely considered a quintessential work of popular music. **Fusion**: Mahavishnu Orchestra - [""Vital Transformation""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAU5o246VSA) Fusion Jazz combined rock beats and instrumentation with jazz improvisation and technical virtuosity. The genre had been brewing for awhile before guitarist John McLaughlin formed this group, but Mahavishnu's first album *Inner Mounting Flame* (which this track is off of) is a big part of why we consider it a distinct form of music. Marked by frenetic solos and rapid-fire beats, it hits a sweet spot between rock aggression and jazz precision. **Outlaw Country**: Waylon Jennings - [""Lonesome, On'ry and Mean""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1mw4ImMUmQ) During a time in the late '60s and early '70s when country radio was dominated by a slick, Nashville-produced sound that turned country into string-laden pop ballads, a group of traditionalist such as Jennings, Merle Haggard, David Allen Coe and Willie Nelson worked to keep country closer to its working-class roots, while also incorporating rock band inspired instrumentation. Jennings is a great intro, a brilliant interpreter of songs. This track pure country craftsmanship, standing out even outside the context of its era. **Bluegrass**: Flatt & Scruggs - [""Foggy Mountain Breakdown""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Y3mnj-8lA) If it helps, think of bluegrass as the heavy metal of early country music, often (though certainly not always) waylaying song craft for speed, noise and technical virtuosity. Flatt & Scruggs helped popularize the style as much as anyone, with a popular television show in the early 50s and a number of country hits. This track was their theme, and helped with a bluegrass revival in the late '60's when it was used in the chase scenes in *Bonnie & Clyde* (and subsequently every parody of that done since). **Delta Blues**: Robert Johnson - [""Hellhound on My Trail""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UVgH9JqSnQ) Another lightening rod figure in popular music, Johnson recorded only a handful of tracks in his short life, but those (especially those featured on the classic *King of the Delta Blues Singers* compilation) have become woven into the DNA of blues and all the popular music that sprung from that. Delta blues is as much a regional definition as a defined musical style, but it's hard to argue Johnson as its seminal figure, a masterful guitarist who created often haunting music from a variety of sources, both contemporary and traditional. This track is a spooky masterpiece of tone, and a great into to both Johnson and Delta blues. **Chicago Blues**: Magic Sam - [""Sweet Home, Chicago""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83rkEm7s5es) Incorporating electric guitars, danceable rhythms, horns and extended solos, Chicago-style blues was an urbanized, night-club ready version of the blues that expanded the genre's boundaries from its country roots. Magic Sam was a perfect definition of the style, particularly of his classic *West Side Soul* album. This track was penned by Robert Johnson, but Sam did the definitive version. **Cosmopolitan Country**: Charlie Rich - [""Behind Closed Doors""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3iEFfA4TmI) Remember that slick, string-laden country sound I mentioned the outlaw country crowd rebelled against? It also produced some great songs on its own. Often disparaged as inauthentic and more pop than country, cosmopolitan country still produced tracks that seemed to transcend genre, and could be performed as easily by an R&B artist as someone with a Southern twang. Rich's ""Behind Closed Doors"" is about as perfect as the genre got.  **California Singer/Songwriter ('70s)**: Joni Mitchell - [""Free Man in Paris""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQj6h8KpkiQ) Inspired by rock, pop and folk, the California singer/songwriter scene was often disparaged but was broadly influential. Jackson Brown and Warren Zevon both fit into the style, but Mitchell was the most musically ambitious. This track was a modest radio hit. It's sunny and catchy, but also a complex and deeply felt piece of songwriting.  **Psychedelic ('60s)**: The Byrds - [""I See You""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwcNxD6iduI) Psychedelic was rock music inspired by hallucinogenics, but also by free jazz, musique concr√®te and other avant-gard influences. The Byrds were as much a folk-rock group as a psychedelic act, but they weaved these styles together with ease and created often brilliant, harmonious pop music. This track is hardly the most psychedelic of their works (I'd also recommend Jefferson Airplane's first album as an introduction to the genre), but it hits the looseness off the style just right without wandering off into stranger territory. **Country Rock ('70s)**: New Riders of the Purple Sage - [""Henry""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4GscuwNn9A) While outlaw country was country artist inspired by rock attitudes and music, country rock was usually rock artist who grew up on country. The New Riders were one of the most steadfast in the genre, sharing a close relationship with the Grateful Dead (Jerry Garcia performed on their first album and the bands often toured together), and sharing a strong musicianship (though NRPS focused on machine-tight songwriting). This track sums up the humor, drug obsessions and radio-friendly hooks of the genre. **Alternative Country**: Uncle Tupelo - [""Graveyard Shift""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKo_1rVClOk) In the late '80s and early '90s, a number of punk and indie rock acts started experimenting with traditional country sounds, building out what would soon be called alternative country. Uncle Tupelo opened the gates for the genre with their first album, which this rip-roarer was the opening track, full of a kind of aggression totally missing from popular country music at the time. It splits the difference between punk assault and country heartbreak. **R&B ('60s)**: Otis Redding - [""Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCmUhYSr-e4) One of the most vital and diverse styles of popular music, rhythm and blues has been through so many permutations it's hard to define it as a single genre. Inspired by blues but incorporating pop melodies and classic ballads, the genre has mutated and reinvented itself consistently for 70 years now. This track was Redding's masterpiece, a deceptively simple track that has never been outdone and defines the genre at one of its creative heights. **R&B (modern)**: D'Angelo - [""Brown Sugar""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtZWO3HgRdA) R&B lapsed into a creative stagnation after a massive rise in popularity in the 1990s, but restless artists still found ways to update the genre, often by reaching back into its deep history for inspiration. Inspired by classic soul and the musical landscapes of Marvin Gaye, D'Angelo revitalized the genre with his first two albums, *Brown Sugar* and *Voodoo*. The title track off the first album, this track exemplifies the smooth, seductive sounds of '90s R&B removed of the flamboyant excesses that plagued R&B in this era. **Soul ('60s)**: Sam & Dave - [""Hold On, I'm Comin'""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AREppyQf5uw) Soul took the rhythms of R&B, the passion of gospel and the energy of jazz and mixed it into a powerful dance hall music that became so entwined with R&B that the two virtually became the same genre. While the genre lines get a little blurry around the edges, there are some artists who are definitively soul. Sam & Dave recorded a number of great hits for Stax, many of them (such as this number) produced by a young Isaac Hayes. Many know the track for its appearance in the film *The Blues Brothers* and the funk beat and super-catchy horn lines make for a great intro. **Neo-Soul**: Kem - [""I Can't Stop Loving You""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KchpUY0Ngbk) Neo-Soul is kind of the alt-country of modern R&B, rarely producing hits but pulling from the best traditions for some of the most creative work in the genre. Drawing as much from modern hip-hop production as classic soul and R&B, it's produced a few great artists and balladeers. This smooth-as-silk track from Kem borders on cheesy but is so heartfelt the straightforward it makes a good entryway. **Garage Rock ('60s)**: The Barracudas - [""Baby Get Lost""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-tA12qv0Xs) Everyone loved the Beatles, but every boy who could afford an electric guitar in the early '60s wanted to be the Kinks. Garage was the punk rock of the era, so much so that the more you get into the history of it you stop seeing punk as something that just exploded and more of a natural progression of a long running rock tradition. Plenty of great bands here that have gone on to become cult acts, such as the Sonics, the Creation, the Monks and so forth. I chose this track for it's (relative to the genre) complex guitar lick and catchy simplicity. **Garage Rock (modern)**: Bass Drum of Death - [""Dregs""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-bVUefdwCY) The attraction of bashing out straightforward rock numbers in dingy basements and rehearsal spaces with your drunk friends never grows old. With a minor revival kicked off by the White Stripes and the Hives now pretty much forgotten, garage is still kicking around and always seems on the verge of bursting forward again. This track shows the genre a little more sophisticated than it was 50 years ago, but still keeping it basic. **Proto-Punk**: Richard Hell & The Voidoids - [""Blank Generation""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP3x-VdOb44) Proto-punk is one of those labels that gets applied in hindsight to tie together a scene that was moving toward a certain goal that wasn't quite clear at the time. When this came out, it was just called punk (so were the Talking Heads, by the way), but that label just doesn't seem to fit anymore. Basically, it's an artier, more sophisticated garage rock that created the groundwork for the punk scene, if not always punk music itself. Richard Hell created remarkably little music for having such a broad influence. This track became his, and for awhile the early punk scene's, anthem. **Punk**: The Clash - [""Janie Jones""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyoW0tf6N-Q) The stereotypical story is that as rock music became bloated, so focused on extended compositions and endless guitar solo noodling, a backlash brewed in lower-class neighborhoods both in the US and England, bringing rock back to its three chord roots. It's a little more complicated than that and prog rock got a bad rep out of the whole thing, but however it came about we ended up with punk. The Ramones were one of the first to really define the style, but London's The Clash were the soul of what the genre became, complete with its political radicalism, straight forward sound and early rock 'n' roll inspired melodies (the reggae and roots influences also spread sporadically through punk's DNA). This track, the album opener on the UK version, became one of the touchstones of early British punk. **Hardcore Punk**: Black Flag - [""Nervous Breakdown""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=302oEzSPCqE) Even a stripped down music can get more stripped down. The gangsta rap to early punk's hip hop, hardcore punk began in disaffected urban areas in the US, major scenes really building up in Los Angeles and Washington DC. The music favored aggression over melody, a shorter-faster-louder aesthetic that burned up quick but left a pretty cool looking corpse. Black Flag became one of punk rock's standard-bearers, blazing a trail that would have a major influence in both the genre itself as well as independent music in general, especially after Henry Rollins was hired on as lead singer. This track, with vocals by Keith Morris of the Circle Jerks, has all the bearings of hardcore while still being frenzied little earworm. **Progressive Rock**: Yes - [Siberian Khatru](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0HnIr6jYWU) Prog suffered under a bad rap for a long time, labeled as pretentious musical self-indulgence more focused on extended solos and blathering concept albums falling into the deep end of meaningless abstraction than on creating anything that resembled real human music. That's all vaguely true, to a point, but it also ignores the vast merits of the genre, stacked full with some of the best musicians rock ever produced. Yes is an easy entry point, with their soaring vocals, rushing baselines and Rick Wakeman's dazzling keyboard work. This track, off of 1972's *Close to the Edge* shows both the ambition of the music, but also tightly focused compositional skills.  **New Wave**: Blondie - [""Heart of Glass""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa911_8TP2s) It can be said that ""new wave"" was created as a marketing term to take the more accessible bands out of New York's punk scene and actually get them to sell records. The label has grown to incorporate a subset of bands with ties to punk, but who incorporated elements of pop, dance and electronic music into their sound. Blondie hit all the touch points of new wave, casting a wide net through recent popular music history. This track is partly their take on disco and shows an accessible genre at its most accessible. **Post-Punk**: Gang of Four - [""Damaged Goods""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byCqOvRMOvo) Post-punk existed almost as soon as the first punk singles came out (Wire's *Pink Flag* came out the same year as the Ramones *Leave Home* and *Rocket to Russia* albums), basically becoming a college-educated version of punk, more experimental and artsy but sticking to the aggressive, stripped down, cut-to-the-bone aesthetic that was punk's primary contribution to popular music. It also didn't skimp of the politics, as the British group Gang of Four shows. Incorporating dance beats and funk into a punk frame, the band had a major influence in that is still being felt in indie rock today. This track is their debut single and a caustic little kiss-off. **Surf Rock ('60s)**: The Centurians - [""Bullwinkle Pt. 2""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuTyvah8xxk) Surf rock is a (very) rare example of a music developing around a sporting trend that didn't end up as a total historical dead end. That you can pretty much trace the entire style to Dick Dale is also interesting. Defined by fast, reverb-heavy guitars (if you've ever seen Dale play, he used heavy gauge strings and grinds his picks to dust) Eastern-inspired musical scales and a frantic sound meant to invoke the feel of a surfer riding a wave, surf had a brief popularity in the late '50s and early '60s but was soon eclipsed by the British Invasion bands. Dale's signature track, ""Misirlou"" came back into the public consciousness thanks to its inclusion on the *Pulp Fiction* soundtrack. I chose this, that compilation's other surf rock number, to show off the more dreamy, watching-the-ocean-at-sunset tones the style was capable of.   **Surf Rock (modern)**: Man or Astro-Man? - [""The Heavies""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9_3ZJLu60) Surf rock got a second life in the 1990s during the alternative music boom, drawn back in and mashed up with a wide variety of trash culture it was connected to by association, often played with a punk attitude. Man or Astro-Man? where one of the best to come out of the brief revival, wrapping surf up in a '50's science fiction aesthetic, mashing in UFO's, monster movies and a Devo-inspired personal mythology along with their guitar thrash. **Synthpunk**: Suicide - [""Ghost Rider""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGLJoXpKo4U) Combining the forward rush of punk with electronic and experimental music, synthpunk is one of those genres that started early in the punk scene and always seemed to pop in and out of view as bands picked it up and made some noise. Suicide were the first to wear the label and remain a touchstone of the genre. This track, best known now as the source of the main riff in M.I.A.'s ""Born Free"" is one of their more accessible. **Art Rock**: Brian Eno - [""Baby's on Fire""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nItuhuY1U04) ""Art rock"" is one of those labels that works well for describing the idiosyncratic works of artists that only barely fit into the rock genre, if they fit into anything at all. Distinguished from prog by its lack of classically inspired compositions and a stronger experimental edge, art rock covers everything from early Genesis to Pink Floyd's middle period to my chosen track here by Brian Eno. After leaving Roxy Music, Eno released a series of astounding solo records, starting with *Here Come the Warm Jets* and ending with *Before and After Science*. The free associative lyrics flow over layered, mangled rock numbers that Eno twisted around in the production studio. This track includes a powerful solo from King Crimson's Robert Fripp and shows off Eno's dark lyrical humor. **Ambient**: Brian Eno - [""Music for Airports""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfKcu_ze-60) Not a lot of people can claim to have created a genre, and while ambient-style music had been floating around for years in the avant-gard scene, Eno solidified it with a strong theoretical backing. This album was created to help calm nervous travelers at airports, and is the earliest example of a style that would influence a broad range of electronic music. **Disco**: Chic - [""Everybody Dance""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOx81aG-EN4) Probably one of the most unfairly (and sometimes fairly) maligned styles of popular music in the last century, disco was a style of dance music pulling from jazz, funk and pop to create propulsive beats, cheerful melodies and extended dancehall breakdowns. Chic was distinguished from a lot of other disco acts by being a real band rather than a production studio creation, and included two of the best pop songwriters/producers of its era in guitarist Nile Rodgers and bassist Bernard Edwards. The bassline for their hit ""Good Times"" was sampled by Grandmaster Flash, the Sugerhill Gang and Daft Punk, and inspired Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust."" This track shows off everything the band, and disco, did well, with it's modal guitar lines, upbeat harmonies and relatively complex jazz chords. **Rockabilly ('50s)**: The Johnny Burnette Trio - [""Train Kept A-Rollin'""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtcVvWRvrIU) Country music when it first met electric guitars and pure aggression is how we got rockabilly. Fast paced, with a deep reverb sound, it was rock 'n' roll just as rock 'n' roll was becoming a thing. This track, covered by both the Yardbirds and Aerosmith, is a distorted barn burner that shows off the genre at its most unhinged. **Rock 'n' Roll ('50s)**: Buddy Holly and the Crickets - [""That'll Be the Day""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq9FCBatl3A) The foundations of rock started when people started pulling in R&B, country & western, tossing in electric guitars and saxophones and pushing the tempo up to a little faster than the old people were comfortable with. The first rock 'n' roll track is arguably Ike Turner's ""Rocket '88'"", but it's hard to deny the influence of Buddy Holly, who recorded some of rock's earliest classics in his too-short life. Bringing a Texas country twang (the Crickets started out as a country act) to the R&B he loved, Holly wrote relatively complex music for a teenage audience (check the rolling snare drums on ""Peggy Sue"" or the rain drop strings on his solo pop numbers). This is, in hindsight, his anthem. **College Rock ('80s)**: R.E.M. - [""These Days""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv_78in5iGE) Slightly country-ish, slightly folk-ish and certainly out of place in the hair metal 1980's, college rock is another of those labels used kind of after the fact due to its popularity on college radio and for its brainier, more introspective style when compared to the popular music of the day. A lot of this has aged horribly, but early R.E.M. still stands up as some of the best the genre has to offer. This track showcases the band at their most propulsive, years before they exploded their sound in the face of popular success. **Grunge**: Mudhoney - [""Touch Me I'm Sick""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbAbMZEt4Uw) So great and so quickly exploited. Grunge is what happens when you leave a beer-drinking blue collar region that had a decent punk scene alone for too long without anyone looking, and when you collect a bunch of rock musicians who all think *My War* is the best Black Flag album. While its most popular acts are the least indicative of the style, Mudhoney is still the one you can always point to and say that's what grunge is. Deeply distorted rock 'n' roll that combined layers of sonic sludge over punk aggression. This, their first single, is still one of their best. **Heavy Metal ('70s)**: Black Sabbath - [""Supernaut""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKIxd5e_ydI) Defined by a pounding sonic dominance, huge riffs and wailing vocals, metal was rock as total warfare. Its since moved into more sub-genres than I can even begin to do justice to, but it starts here with Black Sabbath. The darkness, the heaviness, the powerful drums and rumbling bass, the lyrics obsessed with grand themes given religious importance. It's the source code that would spawn legions throwing the horns. **Thrash Metal ('80s)**: Megadeth - [""Killing is My Business...And Business is Good""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vBhkMYE980) Metal in a way subsumed prog rock (devoured it whole in some cases) as the rock genre most obsessed with technical virtuosity, which is how you end up with heavily tattooed people swinging their heads around at high velocity, screaming about the Devil while playing chord changes that would make a jazz freak nod in approval. Thrash took the gutter crunch of Motorhead and pushed it even further, upping the tempo while remaining compellingly complex. **No Wave**: Sonic Youth - [""Death Valley '69""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zPOcllS9Q) As the punk rock scene started to become creatively stagnant (though nowhere near death), a number of artists and musicians in New York took up punk's call but applied the aesthetics of experimental music and performance art, creating a harsh, almost caustic sound that relied heavily on noise and, often, pure sonic brutality. Most of these bands burned out as quickly as they started, and the genre collapsed shortly after it had been documented in Brian Eno's *No Wave New York* comp, but a few held on. Sonic Youth became the most culturally significant and longest lasting group to spring from this stew. While this track is a lot more accessible than most no wave, it still has the harsh, experimental tones that defined the genre. Bonus points for having Lydia Lunch, from Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, on vocals. **New Traditionalist Country**: George Strait - [""Amarillo By Morning""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9uLKLhm0Eg) Country entered another creatively stagnant period in the late 1970s and early '80s, remaining popular music but with both the outlaw country stars and the old mainstays struggling to create relevant music. The New Traditionalists worked to bring things back to the roots again, but this time incorporating more modern pop melodies. When you think of modern country in the 1980s and 90s, this is mostly what you're thinking of, the ""country"" when people say they ""like everything but rap and country."" But that doesn't mean it didn't produce some great songwriting. George Strait, the most popular recording artist in America that only like three people on this website have ever listened to, is the godhead of the style, performing songs that could have been recorded just as easily 30 years earlier, but giving them a modern pop sheen. This track is a cover of a Terry Stafford track from about a decade earlier. **Swing ('40s)**: Benny Goodman - [""Sing, Sing, Sing""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhyhP_5VfKM) Jazz started as dance music, and swing is that stand of the genre in its purest form. Defined by big orchestras (to make sure the band was heard over the audience in crowded clubs in pre-PA days) and dance floor rhythms underlying jazz solos, swing became some of the most popular music of its day, lasting right up to the early 1950s. This track, Goodman's most memorable performance and his band's masterpiece, shows off everything the genre did right without any of the deficits that would soon render it creatively stale. **Britpop**: Blur - [""Country House""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXqYajt67J4) Influenced by the more ambitious pop work of the Kinks and looking the shed the dourness of shoegaze, Britpop was British rock's counterpart to American indie rock and alt-rock through the mid 1990s. And like its counterpart, it basically was done for by the end of the decade, creatively exhausted and with its biggest bands either falling apart or floundering through genres until they finally broke free entirely. Oasis was the biggest band to come out of it, but I prefer this Blur track as a good introduction. It shows off the humor, the Kinks-inspired idiosyncratic nature of the genre.  **Shoegaze**: My Bloody Valentine - [""I Only Said""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVj-fc1M_D0) Short lived but fairly influential (with a revival happening as we speak in modern indie rock), shoegaze (a disparaging name mocking the stereotype of its self-serious performers staring at their shoes on stage) began in the late 1980s and ran through the early '90s in Britain. Defined by effects and distortion laden guitars, hushed vocals that are often incomprehensible and a Phil Spector-style wall of sound created by a humming guitar drone, the style can be as soothing as it is punishingly loud. My Bloody Valentine's *Loveless* was a touchstone of the genre and one of the best albums of its era. Though few other bands hit this kind of sonic richness, it still makes a solid introduction to the genre.   **Ska (Jamaican)**: Toots & the Maytals [""Pressure Drop""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rb13ksYO0s) Drawing on American R&B but mixing it with local sounds (such as calypso), ska was Jamacia's most popular form of music through much of the 1960s. Light, upbeat dance music, it laid the foundation for reggae and rocksteady and had a major influence abroad, inspiring revivals in Britain and America in the 1970s and 1990s. This track was one of the first to bring the music to the US, thanks to its inclusion on the *The Harder They Come* soundtrack. **Ska (2 Tone)**: The Specials - [""A Message to You, Rudy""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z17Josu1r2g) The first major revival of ska in Britain, 2 Tone (named for the record label that popularized it) or ""second wave"" ska sat kind of adjacent to the British punk scene and incorporated that sound as an influence. The Specials created some of this revival's most indicative sounds, taking the upbeat rhythms of ska and giving it some punk energy. This track is low key but shows off the sharp songwriting chops the genre often inspired. [Edit: I was reminded this is a cover, not an original, which I had completely forgotten. Write it off to me being a dink. Still a great track though, so I'm leaving it up]. **Roots Reggae**: Burning Spear - [""Marcus Garvey""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGN3R49-CAE&list=PL1C8F09E7E9238933) For a lot of people, roots reggae is just what they think of when they think of reggae, and the genre begins and ends with the Bob Marley *Legends* comp (which is why I didn't use him here). But the genre is more diverse than that. Drawing from ska and rocksteady, but slowing the tempos and focusing on more spiritual or political matters, reggae was in some ways the country music of Jamaica. Burning Spear was one of the most soulful groups (it's both a group and a solo performer; this track is by the original group) and this track shows that. **Tropicalia**: Caetano Veloso - [""Tropicalia""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkydG29xWUU) Tropicalia was a Brazilian artistic movement that was a lot more than just music. But the music was it's primary legacy and was marked by a blending of a broad range of influences into the traditions of Brazilian music, included but not limited to American rock 'n' roll and R&B. While it sounds pretty innocuous now, this was deeply political music, eventually leading to Veloso's imprisonment and exile. This is the track that eventually gave the movement its name, showing off the beautiful cultural cannibalism that defined the movement.",2848
31iedl,"Needless to say this is just speculating, but speculating is part of what makes music discussion fun. To Pimp a Butterfly is already hailed as a milestone hip-hop album. It has an insane Metacritic score of 96/100 and a Rate Your Music average rating of 4.10. You have to go VERY far back to find another record praised so highly by so many. Kid A? It seems ""big rock"" is dead, while indie releases are only pushing boundaries in very small increments, using a lot of throwback sounds  to achieve so. This is a generalisation of course. There's a lot of good music out there, but there's been a long time since there's been a milestone rock release, an album that got very popular, was stellar front to back WHILE changing the whole game and breathing fresh blood into the genre. The closest I can think of in recent memory is perhaps Merriweather Post Pavillion from 2009, otherwise you gotta go way back. So could we see it in the 2010s? Can we see it ever, or has the music landscape become too fragmented? Who are up to it? Can Radiohead pull it off once more? Will Tame Impala step it up (once more) and give us a masterpiece with their third LP this year?  ","I think there were a lot of signs that To Pimp a Butterfly would elevate the competition. In interviews, Kendrick talked about raising the game, not to mention guest features were he simply rapped his ass off. Kendrick also released GKMC, heralded among both the pitchfork crowd, as well as the casual rap fan. Then there was control. Control I think was the clearest sign that Kendrick's next project would be ridiculous. I think anyone paying attention to rap could see that Kendrick was ready to change everything. On to rock music, as that's where the discussion is meant to be. Rock doesn't have that leading light, accepted among the skinny jeans wearers and regular festival goers. This is because rock is no longer the genre of the generation. In the 2000s rock was THE genre, on the radio, on CD, whatever. It was rock that pop got it's influence from at the time, and it was rock that the album of that decade (Kid A) changed. I think after Kanye's first two albums, the genre is now Hip-Hop. The public has their eyes on hip-hop stars. Let's be real there is way more gossip about Kanye or Tyga then their is about Thom Yorke or Panda Bear. With the culture turned towards Hip-Hop, I think this decade's album had to be a hip-hop album. There really won't be a Kid A of Rock this decade, just like there wasn't a ""Bitch's Brew"" for jazz in the 2000s. Also with the racial tensions in Ferguson, and the Eric Garner case it really HAD to be a hip-hop album. TL;DR We wont get a rock version of TPaB, because Hip-Hop is THE genre at this moment in time.",188
4qa8hi,"I've been thinking about a concept I've called ""dead albums."" Music that you've become unable to listen to because of its strong connection to events in your life and are therefore effectively dead to you. It's not even necessarily heartbreak or sorrow, just the feeling of no longer being the person who came to love this music (even if the music itself still holds up.) Although, I think this could also be expanded to include music that has simply lost its appeal due to a change in your taste. The entire concept is really an ode to music's profound impact on our lives. Auditory memory has the second greatest capacity for recollective memory and nostalgia (olfactory has the greatest.) I'm wondering if anyone else has come across this phenomenon and if anyone has any tips of how to get over it. There's some great music I'm missing. Edit: Thank you all for sharing your experiences. It comforts me to know that we can all lose albums.","[The Cure - Disintegration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVOSPb9B1SU) (and really, anything by that band) This will always remind me of my ex-wife, and I just can't listen to it. She was the first person I dated that made me shed the pretentious idea that I could only date someone who had similar artistic tastes. Our musical inclinations only intersected in a few places, and The Cure was a major one. One of our first dates ended late at night in a Lower East Side bar. Before I even knew what she liked, I pumped some quarters into a jukebox and hoped for the best. One of the songs I picked was [Just Like Heaven.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dhn_iIQXDE) It made us get up and dance at a place where nobody else was dancing - drunk on lust and joy. 4 years later it would be the first dance at our wedding. We decided to move from NYC to SF a couple years later, and drove a moving truck cross-country. The trip happened to coincide with our anniversary, so we treated ourselves to a massage in Pittsburgh of all places. They asked if we wanted music to be played while we got the massages, and we cued up Disintegration. Oddly enough, the move out west, trouble finding employment, and the sudden lack of social structure made the marriage fall apart. Nobody cheated, nobody was mean, it quite literally..... disintegrated.  Even now I'm linking these songs and have to switch them off after about 20 seconds. It's just too much to remember the joy that was smothered in pain when I lost her. Funny enough, while I was reeling after the breakup, this performance of [Pictures of You, by Staten Island's PS 22 chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxZX8LpFOKo) (you should seriously check out all their stuff) was something that helped get me through. Lyrically, I think the connection was obvious, but the performance has a certain innocence to it that allowed me to heal. Interesting how getting intimate with that version in a different context allows me to be able to listen to it with joy, even though it's still a Cure song.  The odd thing for me about ""dead albums"" is that they meander in and around your emotions and mindset over time. It's happened before for me that an album is dead at first, but will trip back into my life because I've somehow aligned myself with it again. It's inexplicable, but it happens, so let's be a little hopeful. I'll be here waiting for Disintegration to once again coalesce for me.",155
5c46ft,"The bread and butter of a lot of Punk music is political unrest from the left. Many are calling Trump a G. W. Bush Part 3. Look at American Idiot, or any of the other political commentary songs of the era. I've also considered the possibility in a further growing of ""Struggle music"", think Kendrick Lamar or RTJ. Not that the two are mutually exclusive, but one may over shadow the other. P.S I'm not sure if this sub has any rules on politics but if it does I don't mean to be stepping on them. I don't want this to turn into another commentary on the election either pro or anti Trump.","This was the first thing I thought when I woke up to the news this morning.

5i0wlw,"Haydn was a self-taught peasant. Beethoven came from a down-and-out family and his dad was always in and out of jail. Bach was a poor orphan who had to steal blank sheet music in his teens because he couldn't afford it. Let's get on to Brahms. His family lived in a slum. They were so famously destitute that he had to supplement the family income by playing the piano in a whorehouse at the ripe old age of 11. Or Chopin, whose parents were servants and who couldn't even afford a piano teacher - yet he grew up to be one of the greatest piano composers (and teachers) in history. And let's talk about the highest paid concert pianist of the 19th century. You're probably picturing some well-to-do white guy in a powdered wig. Actually, the highest paid concert pianist of the 19th century had a double claim to fame - he is believed to have been the last legally owned slave in the USA. His name was Tom Wiggins, a black slave born on a plantation who was completely blind and was even named legally insane. Yet he loved classical music and had a repertoire of over 7000 pieces. And he was the highest paid concert pianist of the 19th century. In fact, prior to the 20th century, it was an extreme social taboo for the upper classes to seek a career in music. The most notable pre-20th century upper class composer I am aware of was the very talented Prince Ferdinand of Prussia. Ever heard of him? Thought not. And he's the *most* notable pre-20th century upper class composer I can think of. Even during the 20th century, many composers came from lives of terrible misfortune; Messiaen composed one of the 20th century's greatest pieces of classical music while living in a concentration camp during WWII. Classical music is a working class and middle class story. It's music of the people. Yes, rich people might have paid for a lot of it, but it tells the emotions and hardships of ordinary people. It's not for snobs. It's a 1000 year old recorded testament of the inner emotional lives of generations of working class and middle class people. To dismiss it as irrelevant music for snobs is - without any kind of hyperbole - a crime against history. You might as well demolish the pyramids of Giza under the illusion that they speak only for the pharaohs they were built for - when in fact they more meaningfully tell the story of the workers who built them. Don't let anti-intellectualism and reverse snobbery destroy our heritage. We seem to live in a culture where any tradition from before the 1950s is viewed as ""posh"". This also goes for great literature and the visual arts. The truth is that many of the greatest poets, novelists, painters and composers in history had horrific lives. Just look at Bach, an orphan who was widowed twice and had to bury 11 of his children. That's *why* these artists spent so much time trying to depict the breadth of human emotion. They felt something and they wanted to share it. We need to stop depicting these people as upper class boogeymen. I am absolutely sick of propaganda that seeks to deprive the working and middle classes from their cultural heritage. That's what this inverted snobbery against classical music is. Ordinary people composed it, and it is owned equally by every single member of the human race. That's the gift they gave us. Please don't throw it away in the name of some misguided attempt at reverse snobbery.","You covered the ""by"" part. These composers were basically servants of the nobility/aristocracy, definitely not upper class themselves. But what about ""for""? Weren't they mostly working on commission or under retainer for wealthy patrons or for the church? (even if they did have a secondary audience in the masses)",94
66dzhd,"I've listened to the album a few times, and while I thoroughly enjoy it, I'm having a hard time identifying the aspects of it that make it so influential. I think I can see the influence it had on shoegaze with songs like ""European Son"" ""Heroin"" and ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" but that's about it. I realize it's probably similar to the ""Seinfeld is Unfunny"" effect in that its aspects are seen everywhere now so it doesn't seem so special. But I still want to know exactly what they did that was different and 'unheard of' for the time.  Basically, I want that quote ""all 30,000 people who bought the album started a band"" explained. Thanks guys","Okay, I'll try to answer this in a few minutes as I have to be somewhere in a little while: I totally relate to your confusion about *why* ""VU&N"" is regarded as so groundbreaking. I'm 42 and I got introduced to the VU pretty early on by my dad. When I first heard this album at age 10 (1985), it just sounded like poorly-recorded, badly-played early Rolling Stones to my ears.  But the more you listen to *a lot* of pop and rock music from the period in which is was recorded, the more you start to hear what makes ""VU&N"" stand out in its time. For one thing, the record, as I said above, sounded poorly recorded to my ears on a first listen. And today, it still sounds like it was recorded with all the meters in the red - everything sounds blown out and distorted. The grungy recording quality, in retrospect, feels like a conscious choice on the part of the Velvets. This was, after all, 1967 - the year that the Beatles set the standard for good sound quality and sophisticated production in rock music. Music production had been getting cleaner, more defined, throughout the 60s. While there was a fad for distorted guitar sounds in those years (in the waning garage rock scene (I.e. locals and amateurs imitating The Stones) *and* in the more sophisticated rock scene of the day (i.e bands like Cream, Hendrix, and the Yardbirds), that fad was mainly limited to the guitars only - every other instrument was becoming more well-defined in the typical rock sound mix of the day.  Because of George Martin and the Beatles' advances in recording techniques, rock bands in the studio were now recording their music in stereo, on recording machines that were graduating from basic 4-track to multi-track (""Sgt. Pepper,"" it should be noted, was recorded entirely with 4-track). So basically, rock music, as recorded in the studio, was becoming more and more intricate, sophisticated, and detailed. Rock musicians and producers were becoming more and more concerned with providing a vehicle for multi-part compositions, rock bands like the Moody Blues were cribbing notes from the classical music world and creating ""art"" in the form of musical suites (this strain of rock would later come to be called ""prog"" (i.e. progressive rock) but in its time it was called ""art rock.""  So while the rest of the rock music world was trying to make rock music more complex, full of tempo shifts and dramatic shifts in tone and structure, more full of non-rock band instruments (i.e. string sections, horn sections, traditional folk instruments, exotic sounds borrowed from India, etc.) more finely detailed, something more akin to high art, the Velvet Underground were already running a counter-movement.  Their music was intentionally crude and simple in execution. Instead of the sprawling ambition of the psychedelic bands, the Velvets just wanted to make noise. Instead of multi-part epics full of every chord imaginable, the Velvets restricted their songs to just a handful of chords - sometimes only two or three. Their music was recorded crudely, too - there was distortion on *everything* and it was hard to tell if that was a conscious move or not - either way, the sheer *sound* of that first Velvets album would have been a shock to its contemporary audience, since it was so grungy and muddy. In 1967, that wasn't considered radical or revolutionary, it was just considered ""bad sound."" Some musicians of the day who heard ""VU&N"" dismissed it because it represented to them the kind of music they'd wanted to leave behind - the simple, basic garage rock that had been the by-product of the Beatles and Stones capturing the imaginations of suburban kids across the US circa 64-65.  By 1966, with ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Revolver"" under their belts, the Beatles had signaled that there would be a movement *away* from crudely-played small-band rock music, and *toward* a more sophisiticated, urbane, high-minded type of rock music. The Velvets, along with a few urban bands like The Fugs and The Godz, represented a reversal of this movement.  ANother thing you have to realize is that that album, along with the Velvets themselves, were largely ignored upon their arrival. ""Rolling Stone"" didn't write about them in any kind of serious way, they were strictly an underground ""art"" phenomenon (due to their association with Warhol). In a commercial sense, that record was a complete dud. It didn't sell. Outside of Manhattan (and Boston, where they faithfully played the Tea Party club there for many years), they were unknowns. Rock music wasn't the ubiquitous phenomenon it would become in the 80s and 90s, with stores and public places playing rock music constantly. Rock music - even the really safe stuff! - was still considered too raucous and crazy to be played in public. If you had a successful rock band then, there were good chances that the band was wholly a creation of a record company and the record company would be the entity responsible for calling the band's tune (for instance, the Monkees not being allowed to play their own instruments on their first records, or The Byrds recording ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" with studio pros instead of their actual line-up). It was only the Beatles and Dylan who had really been able to escape this by 1966/67. So the idea of a fully autonomous rock band writing all their own songs in 1967 was still something of a novelty, even among the respected musicians of their day. The Velvets, by this standard, were *insanely* radical as an idea and as a band.  Musically, the Velvets were groundbreaking in that they integrated avant-garde techniques into what was ostensibly crude garage rock, so they were bridging a gap in the culture between ""high"" and ""low"" art - rock music was still seen as ""low,"" mass-market, lowest common demoninator kid's stuff, while John Cale's droning viola, the dissonance of the band, and Moe Tucker's deliberately untutored, bone-simple, rudimentary drumming constituted the ""high"" world of the avant-garde intruding into the ""low"" world of rock music (or vice-versa). At the time, this was a very radical and innovative move. Rock bands were looking to *get away* from dissonance and out-of-tune guitars, while the Velvets seemed to want to drench their songs in them.  They also signaled to a lot of musicians that you could make sophisticated art using crude methods. The fusion of simply-played, basic three chord rock music wed to Lou Reed's poetry was pretty innovative in its day too, as well as Reed's lyrical subject matter: hard drugs (not the sweetness and light of acid and weed, but the stark anxiety and/or numbed-out insanity of smack and speed), perversion, S&M, homosexuality. These were not topics rock bands were supposed to sing about. The Velvets made this fusion work somehow. Jonathan Richman (a devoted VU fan who used to go to all their Boston shows and follow the band around) once explained the appeal of the Velvets in their own time by saying, ""They created an *atmosphere*."" They didn't just play nice, sweet songs about love, they played smart, dark, noisy songs about shooting smack. But their greatest contribution was in showing musicians how to create sophisticated, multi-layered music using crude raw materials. THe Velvets weren't showy or flashy - Moe Tucker rarely played any fills, she stuck to a jungle beat, played with mallets, standing up! Sterling Morrison never played lead, preferring to *just* play down-strummed chords over and over again. There was also no *soul* in the Velvets' sound in 1967. Rock bands - well, *white* rock bands - were obsessed with sounding ""Black"" in the late 60s. ALl kinds of white rockers were trying to play electric blues convincingly, or imititating soul bands. Rock drummers were trying to sound like Al Jackson or other funky soul drummers - they tried to cultivate a deliberate looseness and funk to how they played, they worked on making their beats groove. The Velvets didn't even *try*. They sounded rigid, uptight, four beats to every bar, heavy downstrokes on the guitar. No funk at all, no trying to sound Black. They were stark, monochromatic, dry. There was no jazz or subtlety or lope to their rhythms - it was more of a martial, minimaist insistence on a primal, pounding 1-2-3-4. This further marked them as being *very* different from most rock bands of the day. ",373
6zwegf,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCFh0lJ-WAg This is the gateway video, but the site itself, featuring in-depth questions and analytical opinions is featured here: https://www.ascarnooneelsecansee.com/ I want to start a discussion about Carly's music, and the Jepsen Pattern, here, and I figured this was the right place to do it. Here's the first piece of the intro: Welcome to the lost, alone and searching.               Welcome to climbers of trees, the stealers of bikes, the girl in the corner, the forgotten friends, the little black holes.               Welcome to the rejected, the unwanted, the despairing.  The smell you smell is a blossom tree.  The chill you feel is a cold breeze as you walk the streets alone at night.  The emotion you feel is longing.             The voice you hear is Carly Rae Jepsen.             You might be reading this as a joke.  Out of vague curiosity.  You might‚Äôve thought the person who claimed to have discovered a massive secret pattern in a popstar‚Äôs music was doing it ironically, or maybe just lost on a long hike up their own ass.             Welcome to you, too, the cynics and the disinvested.  Come in, and find out, but first, a warning: ‚Äã             ‚ÄúLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch‚Äôintrate.‚Äù                 This Latin phrase from Dante‚Äôs Inferno translates to:               ‚ÄúAbandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here.‚Äù                         What you‚Äôre looking at, what you‚Äôre about to read, is a living document.  I wrote it as I researched, and it is not without growing pains.  You are experiencing a living document; you will be discovering the phenomenon alongside me. As you proceed through the manuscript, you‚Äôll see my formatting and song analysis evolve.             If you go through completely with this, you‚Äôre definitely going to see connections between songs that I missed.  The Jepsen Pattern, once you understand its rubric, is about as subtle as a brick to the face.  When I started my analysis of EMOTION in the fall of 2016, I had no idea that themes, ideas, and even specific lyrics would echo back over a full decade to Jepsen‚Äôs, unreleased, first EP.  I was still just starting to engage with the scope of what was going on in Jepsen‚Äôs music.               So I want to apologize in advance.  This is a big and clumsy YET SINCERE gesture, and there‚Äôs definitely some things I missed here and there.  Sub-themes showed up before I had created a category for them.  Individual lyrics and images popped back up later, when I had forgotten to take note of them, not realizing they‚Äôd be back.  In retrospect, how could I know?  I had no idea the scale of what I had found.             I want you to engage with this behemoth to whatever degree suits you.  Just read the essays.  Just read the song analysis annexes.  Skip to the end and just read the epilogue.  Certainly be sure to read the intro to Part 2.  Or, fuck it., read the whole thing; because I promise you something:               If you give this your time, if you‚Äôre one of the brave souls who starts at page one and finishes at page done, you will be floored.  Or, at the very least, you will understand why this was all worth it.     Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here.    -  Max Landis, Thursday, June 29th, 2017.

82bojg,"crossposting this from where I posted it in /r/hiphopheads, you guys might actually find it more interesting than they do (where's the autotune?). ---- I've been listening to a lot of MF DOOM lately and came across a set of bars that, after listening and unpacking a bit, I thought were so fucking clever that I wanted to share. I'll jump right in, here are the bars (from the song *That's That* on DOOM's 2009 album *Born Like This*). The whole song is brilliant, but the bars in question come in at 0:59: https://youtu.be/EpVnuD6qnHw?t=59s **Lyrics** *These little titties abilities riddle me, middle C (boom)* *Give a MC a rectal hysterectomy* *Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically*  **Analysis:** For starters, almost every single word in these three bars rhymes with at least one other word. There are three, four, and five syllable words in there that rhyme. Hysterectomy, a word you've probably never heard in a rap song before, is five syllables long and is used here to tie together 'middle-C' and 'technically' while also having an internal rhyme pattern with 'rectal' and 'lecture'. The rhyming pattern here is off the charts in terms of density and complexity.  Okay, fine, the rhyming scheme is impressive. But the lyrical content doesn't look that interesting at first glance. Do the words make any sense? Let's take a look. The first line seems to be about being mystified by small breasts. Maybe DOOM is amazed at how flat chicks get down? The end of the phrase, 'middle C' can be understood as a reference to cup size.  The following two lines are about destroying other MCs with his rhyming ability: I'll wreck another MC so badly I will rip his guts out through his asshole; this is a technical demonstration of how I do that. Okay. Boobs and bragging, that's pretty standard fair for a rap song. But notice that he uses 'hysterectomy' here. A hysterectomy is actually a removal of the uterus. He's not only saying he'll destroy other MCs, he's calling them feminine. That's also not an uncommon theme for a rap song, but once you understand that angle it makes the first bar make a lot more sense. It's a double-entendre. He's calling other MCs little titties. Their abilities riddle him (they suck). 'middle C'? A letter grade. They're average at best. Okay, that's not bad for wordplay. But wait, there's more! C can be construed as a cup-size or a letter grade, but in addition to fitting the rhyming pattern, Middle C means something specific in music. [Middle C](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_C) is the C note in the center of the piano. That's a music reference he's dropping in there at the end of the line, and the third meaning of 'Middle C'. Also, look at the way the third bar ends. 'Foul technically' is brilliant wordplay, in that it fits multiple rhyme patterns and describes the technical quality of DOOM's lecture on disemboweling MCs, as well as the foulness of guts. But it's also a basketball pun. DOOM is talking about wrecking other MCs lyrically, but not physically. He often mocks MCs who talk about shooting each other in his songs. A basketball foul involving no physical contact (e.g. if you cuss out another player or a ref) is called a technical foul. Foul technically. Oh, and we didn't address that (boom) at the end of the first bar, did we? It's an explosion sample. Why throw an explosion noise on the end of a bar about small tits and average MCs? Well there was that musical reference to Middle C. In musical notation, there's a specific designation for which octave middle C falls on. The range is -1 to 10, and middle C is C4. C4 is also an explosive. And the fourth meaning for 'middle C'. That is a demolitions pun wrapped in a musical reference, wrapped double-entendre about sucker MCs and small tits. Ladies and gentleman, MF DOOM. The greatest lyricist alive. ","I'm going to start by being honest, I find MF DOOM overrated. That's not to say he's one of, if not THE greatest underground rappers ever and that he's one of if not THE best at technical rhyming with his overall lyricism damn near top tier if not absolutely top tier (I debate this endlessly with myself because I recognize my bias), but when I see posts like yours OP I can't help but feel a little bitter that some of my favorite emcees don't get anywhere near as much attention while being as good or even better. So let's start with your analysis, which is great overall with a lot of effort. The first line ""These little titties abilities riddle me, middle C (boom)"" is wonderfully dense in rhyming, but I'm going to nitpick. It's a rhyme pattern that's similar to one of the most legendary lines in hip-hop by Big Pun: ""dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know  That we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddly""   I'm going to nitpick again with the second line. A hysterectomy has nothing to do with your digestive tract. Admittedly, like you said it's likely on purpose to accuse emcees of being feminine as a dis, and maybe it's because of my medical background, but the gross inaccuracy always bothered me a little bit and made me feel like he added ""rectal"" to complete the rhyme scheme.  Finally, I have to be honest and say that some of your supposed examples of puns and entendres just seem like reaches or don't work. First off, since when are C cups small? Granted, you could be something like a 28C, but DOOM says ""middle Cs"" - not indicative of small cups at all. Middle C as a musical reference - sure it exists but there's no contextual clues that's what it means. One of the ways people, especially on genius, will stretch supposed entendres is to toss in any meaning of a certain word or phrase ignoring if context actually suggests said meaning. For example, should we mention that ""Cs"" sounds like ""seas"" and suggest that DOOM is throwing in some nautical wordplay in there, to reference the 'waves"" he's making in hip-hop? Same goes with ""foul"" as a basketball reference and especially ""C4"" - although I admit that's cute.  Now, enough nitpicking. Can I also back up what I'm saying and post three bars that I think are better? I'll admit it'd be difficult for me to do, not necessarily cause ultimately I do think the three bars are so good, but because in general I value stuff that works as a whole rather than in isolation. I can namedrop poster /u/BigMethod and some of his breakdowns of Eminem [bars](https://np.reddit.com/r/Eminem/comments/53rz5q/eminems_wordplay_an_analytical_breakdown_of/), especially >Promising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson   I'm in a league Muhammad's in, Ali's my colleague bombing 'em   Probably end up on top of 'em, stomping 'em like Ndamukong   I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson   which is ridiculously rhyme dense and full of entendres. Although to be fair I find Eminem overrated as well and I've argued with him ad nauseam of some of his supposed examples of entendres as well.  So what would be some of my own, honest suggestions? I guess I could throw out the last three bars of Lupe's ""Failure"" which have always been favorite of mine. >Keep my dogs out in front of me   You see what I'm saying   And I push ki's wonderfully   Now those three lines by themselves seem completely unimpressive, there's no complex rhyme scheme or obvious puns, but in context they're completely brilliant IMO. First off, Lupe has been doing an animal scheme throughout the song, meaning mentioning animals usually as metaphors for characters or activities in the hood - hardly original (see the GZA's ""Animal Planet"") but because it's just a small theme of the song rather than the focus, I don't take away points for originality. But ""keep my dogs in front of me"" is also a reference to seeing eye dogs, which is clear when you look at the lines before which clearly reference blindness (""You Sea/see World / It's Braille here / I'm Bumpy Johnson I stick to the streets"") So the next line, you again have a reference to sight, or lack thereof, and ""saying"" is actually a double entendre, referencing Saiyans from DBZ. And the DBZ reference continues with ""push ki's"". But ""push ki's"" is also a reference to pushing ki(los) of cocaine, which fits the overall street theme of the song. And that's not it - push ki's/keys WONDERfully is a reference to BLIND pianist Stevie Wonder.  The whole song is full of that kind of brilliance, wordplay and entendres that don't just arise out of nowhere but build upon previous lines in an organized manner. I'm not just making up meanings, I'm using contextual clues. That will be why I always prefer the wordplay and wittiness of someone like Lupe to guys like MF DOOM and Eminem who will drop an entendre once and never do anything with it again. Okay, I could talk more about my other favorite instances of lyricism but I've written way too much as it is. ",89
8839vk,"I‚Äôm slightly ashamed that I‚Äôm writing this but it‚Äôs for good reason. I say without any hesitation that for over a decade Pitchfork has played a key role in my music taste, and consequently, my identity. I‚Äôm in my later 20s. I had developed a pretty regular schedule of checking the reviews and downloading the albums that appealed to my taste and any albums above a certain threshold of score. This little habit of doing things allowed me to fall in love with albums and genres that I normally never would have discovered. Pitchfork was founded in 1996. My understanding is that from its origins it always had a reputation for pretension. When I started frequenting the site it was relatively late. They already had a history of deleting reviews, changing reviews, giving really bad reviews to anyone popular, etc. If you had a conversation with someone about Pitchfork, making fun of it was usually the first thing that you did. But honestly, it was an endearing mockery. It was like the friend in the group that everyone picked on. When the group is together that person is going to get ripped apart, but 1 on 1 everyone is tight with them.  I cringed when I would read some of the reviews but dammit I trusted whatever number was printed on the review. Every album that is innovative and/or experimental takes at the very least a few listens to understand.  Taking a look at the Albums of the Year of the Past: if someone didn‚Äôt tell me how great Kid A, or My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, or Merriweather Post Pavilion, or The Glow Pt. 2, etc‚Ä¶. was I probably would have listened to them once and tossed them aside. I had to have trust that it was my brain that was a few steps behind these artists, and not the reverse, in order to get to a point that I had understood what it was that artist was setting out to do. If anyone ever asked I would say I learned about most of my music through Pitchfork.  The first time I listened to Sufjan I felt smothered by his religious references, that dude is way too cheesy. Then a close friend told me I was wrong; Sufjan is earnest, try again. He‚Äôll always be one of my favorites now. A music review site that you trust plays this same role. They‚Äôre the friend that grew up playing piano and listens to much more complex music than you. When they tell you somethings good and you don‚Äôt quite get, you know that it‚Äôs because you have to keep trying. I signed on to Pitchfork in high school, and as I said it was still pretty big at that point. It was the already the poster-child for snooty-ness, and hipster-culture, and over-wroughtness. It was a huge player in the culture, but still not big enough that anyone outside of music fans would know about it. People who really really listened to music looked down on Pitchfork a little. But as someone who loves music- but doesn‚Äôt have time to weed through the bad stuff to find the great stuff- it played a wonderful role in navigating me to great music. As it got bigger, the cringier parts started growing, and the integrity started decreasing. They started adding new features. But it was happening slowly overtime, and both the cringe/integrity was growing/declining in a linear fashion. If people asked, I would usually provide a disclaimer first and then say that I learned about most of my music through Pitchfork. In 2015 Pitchfork was bought by Conde Nast. The internet‚Äôs leading magazine and website dedicated to Independent music was bought by a Mass-Media company that brought you the likes of Golf Digest, GQ, Teen Vogue, and Vanity Fair. It was coming. Like I said, Pitchfork had been slowly decreasing integrity for quite a long period of time.  But it still felt utterly ridiculous that of all companies, it was now owned by *Conde Nast*.  Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I started payer closer attention. But Pitchfork very quickly became absolute garbage. The Pitchfork that exists today feels like a different animal from the Pitchfork from 5 years ago. The ads are huge. The articles are click-bait. And worst of all by far: reviews feel carefully curated to fit the cultural norms. Anyone who has followed the site is probably acutely aware of this. Any spirit is dead. Integrity and authenticity aren‚Äôt ends but means. Every review and every article seem to go through the filter of ‚ÄúWill this increase or decrease viewership?‚Äù. I‚Äôm not na√Øve. I know this is how all companies of a certain size must operate. It just feels like the Conde Naste purchase was a turning point where Pitchfork became devoid of any soul whatsoever. A few examples quickly reveal that Pitchfork is now in its entirety devoted to views and clicks. -In the past Pitchfork didn‚Äôt review old albums. Prince died April 21, 2016. Pitchfork capitalized on this by reviewing all previous albums of his that they didn‚Äôt review. I find this despicable. Of course, they gave him a bunch of 10‚Äôs. Yes he‚Äôs a great artist, but how can you honestly review someone who passed away not a month ago? -Cardi B ‚ÄúBodak Yellow‚Äù was song of the year in 2017. I don‚Äôt need to explain more. -I understand that it‚Äôs difficult that they‚Äôre reviewing different genres with the same 0-10 ranking system. But the discrepancy of scores between genres is insanity. The standard that a rock album is held compared to the standard that a rap album is held is fucking ridiculous. An algorithmic rap album that has absolutely nothing new is an automatic 7.0 rating. You can guess about 95% of the rankings just by looking at the cover and the name of the artist. Go the reviews portion of the site. Looks like an unoriginal rap album? 7.0. Is the artist a girl? 7.5 (Don‚Äôt get me wrong, female musicians are undervalued‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the manner in which Pitchfork started quadrupling it‚Äôs female artists as soon as it became hip that makes it clear that it‚Äôs not authentic). Classic album by a famous musician? 9.5. Is the artist playing rock and mainstream enough that your friend in business school knows about them? 5.0 or less. -The news section of Pitchfork is disgusting. The titles are click-bait. They‚Äôre dishonest. The articles read like they‚Äôre non-bias but they ALWAYS push whatever the popular political agenda at the time is.     -This quote: ‚ÄúLil Peep reaches a deeper bottom than Elverum ever did.‚Äù A Reddit user on the most recent Pitchfork AMA summed it up very nicely: ‚ÄúWill switching cellphone providers allow me to finally understand WHY people like King Krule? Or would it be better if I save that money for a bottle of Macallan Single Malt Whisky, consume responsibly, and THEN listen to 'The Ooz'?‚Äù This was long and might seem unnecessary. I think I needed to write it thought because as I said to start, Pitchfork helped shape my identity. It‚Äôs hard to watch something that meant something to you become so devoid of the thing that attracted you to it in the first place. I keep making fun of the site but it's hard for me not to stop from going back to it. I feel like that buddy that has stayed in the relationship way too long and keeps getting back with their significant other, fight after fight: dude you called them an asshole just yesterday... how are you still getting back with them?! Well this marks the official end of my relationship with Pitchfork.  Now with all that said there's no reason to wallow in misery. It's time to get back in the dating pool. What do you use to find your music? What review sites do you think still have integrity? Anyone else have trouble moving on from Pitchfork? ","This is a good thing. I never liked Pitchfork. They are way too holier-than-thou and their reviews always seem to be more about how the author can sound cool than about the music. For a similar site that is just better in my opinion, I‚Äôd recommend Stereogum.",147
88hu1h,"It's been a few years since I was a student so maybe things have changed, but I would never see students or younger people wear R.E.M. shirts. Or talk about R.E.M. Or listen to R.E.M.  While the Pixies, Pavements, and Dinosaur Jr's of the world remain popular with millennials, R.E.M. gets ignored, which is especially interesting because in the 80s they were maybe the definitive college band.  Why no love from the youth of today?  Did they became too popular later on in their career? Too much piano in their songs? Because they ended with multiple mediocre records?","Wow, so this is a topic that's very near and dear to my heart, as I've worked to introduce my 18 yr old daughter to the music I've loved through the years and REM are definitely a part of that. First I want to say that comments about REM being bland, boring or generic are just astoundingly misinformed.  If that's where you're coming from, you literally have no idea what you're talking about.  For the vast majority of Americans, at least, the 80's were about Whitney Houston and stuff like that.  Very few people knew about the amazing music scene that included the likes of Let's Active and the dB's.  There's such an information overload today that most of you have no idea what information scarcity is.  If you didn't know about this stuff there was almost no way you could possibly find out.  Mitch Easter and Don Dixon.  Guadalcanal Diary.  Amazing music that hardly anyone, relatively speaking, had any awareness of. In the midst of this, REM were putting out Murmur, Reckoning, Fables of the Reconstruction and Life's Rich Pageant.  This stuff was incredible, but for some of you you've heard The One I Love a bunch of times at the mall and you figure they're bland.  I mean, really? So for the Christmas before last, I bought my daughter Nick Drake Five Leaves Left (70's), REM Murmur (80's), Belle & Sebastian If You're Feeling Sinister (90's) and Sufjan Stevens Illinoise (00's).  She was in awe of Sufjan Stevens, absolutely adored Belle & Sebastian and found the other two harder to wrap her head around.  I'm fine with that.  This past Christmas, among other albums I got her REM's 25th anniversary Automatic for the People and she has really loved it. So it can be done.  It's a matter of keeping your ears open and being inquisitive.  Go listen to Don Dixon's Million Angels Sigh.  Go listen to Guadalcanal Diary's Jamboree or Litany.  See where it takes you.  As a near 50 yr old dude, I love listening to new shit these days.  I envy some of you that you have so much yet to listen to. ",158
8a7iw7,"IMO, I am sickened by K-Pop both as a industry and as a genre of music. It is the ONLY genre of music on Wikipedia with a ""ethical controversy"" section. Most prospective idols are treated like trash, with very low pay and unreasonably long working hours. And honestly, even with all the popular kpop bands and their music, only a handful of entertainment companies actually own the rights to them. When you support the industry by buying merch/music etc, only a small amount of it goes into the hands of the actual artists, while most of it funnels into the hands of the few corporations, which only further fuels the cycle of mistreatment. Furthermore, I feel like with all the advertisement done around the songs, it mostly promotes the members as a product rather than the music itself. When you hear kpop fans talk about their music, how often do you actually hear them say good things about the songwriting? Most of the time, they just talk about how attractive a certain member is, or how great the production of the video/choreography is. It gives me the feeling of a human zoo honestly. This would be fine and all if this were the modeling industry, but since kpop is supposed to be music focused... I don't know.  That being said, I do concede that music in kpop is generally very well produced. However, I also do believe that there is a very heavy distinction between good music and expensive music. Music produced in kpop often have very unoriginal structure, and lack meaning. It is created not out of creativity, but out of a need for commercialization. However, due to the insane budget, there will obviously be a high end production team working on it, which will make sure the song is catchy and well mixed. However, that does not negate the fact that the music is, to put it bluntly, soulless.  Disclaimer tho, I am not criticizing any members of k-pop groups in particular, nor their ability to perform. They are all talented individuals. I am criticizing the nature of the industry itself as well as the music produced within it.Ôªø So, why do so many younger people invested in the industry when all this information is public knowledge? Edit 1: As many people have pointed out, my statement around the music being soulless seems to be a bit too biased, and isn't exactly a defining trait that only exists in kpop. I apologize for that. Edit 2: Wow, this got alot more comments than I thought it would. Just to clarify things, when I'm referring to K-pop, I am mostly talking about the idol groups that exist under entertainment companies. Edit 3: I do see the flaw in my argument in that much of the criticism I offered towards Kpop can be extended to apply to pop music in general.","Easy. They don't care. It's happening far away. My girlfriend is in it for the pretty boys, well choreographed dancing, and funny videos^that^are^totally^real. Sure there are a bunch of issues involved with artist labour, but what concern is it when they're not even consuming a physical product most of the time; they're videos on YouTube. Are South Korea's labour politics really our problem? We turn a blind eye to much more tangible injustice every day. Half our tech was made by Chinese slave workers, our cheap clothing comes mostly from sweat shops, our eggs come from cramped chicken farms where they live in their own crap. The list goes forever. Who's got the time to be mad about k-pop?",201
8ak1vy,"We always see those posts about ""poorly regarded albums that you like"", where you're meant to explain away your guilty pleasures, your plebiest of pleb opinions. Let's flip that shit. I want the snobbiest of snob opinions here.  RULES:  A) Pick a super pretentious album. Like the music version of Blind (2014). You must actually enjoy the album you pick.  B) Write about your album. Explain why your ability to enjoy this album makes you a true intellectual in this sea of plebs. This album is a thinly veiled attempt to jerk of your own genetically superior ears.  C) Shit on everyone else's picks and make them feel like plebs for picking something so lowly compared to your own album. *THIS* is what you call pretentious! Gah! NOTE: Everyone here is to be assumed to be playing up their snobbiness, nobody should take any of this shit seriously. Similar to TRASH TALK THREADS in other subreddits. ","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Big Black's Atomizer. The music is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of TR-606 drum patterns most of the music will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Steve's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from random newspaper articles, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realize that they're not just messed up- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Big Black truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Steve's existencial catchphrase ""Welcome back Joe,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Roland's genius unfolds itself on their headphones. What fools... how I pity them.  And yes by the way, I DO have a Big Black tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

8saiok,"Guys, I know he just died, so it's both a bit shameless of me to post this, but would anyone be interested in talking what XXXTentacion was? In the context of Hip Hop, he may have been the weirdest of all the soundcloud rap kids, starting as a meme, scoring a legitimate hit with ""Look At Me,"" releasing hit albums whose influences were all over the map in a way that's getting copied all over the place rn. He was also an objectively horrible person, who would fit no narratives for what we'd view as a success.  So... in your opinion, why was he so famous?  What is his legacy, if any?  Did his music speak to you? Even if just briefly? ","I got into XXX before the allegations against him preceded his music. I really liked the ""Free X"" tape, I really thought the dude had something special. He was one of the first rappers who got popular doing the bass-boosted aggressive emo rap with metal and hardcore samples, pretty cutting edge at the time. I'd say he he started to gain popularity because he was one of the better MCs out of the Orlando scene and he had a real artistic vision, a pretty unique way forward. I think the allegations never really stuck because his fans are so young. Adults in their 20s are generally pretty socially aware and cancelled XXX pretty quick, but I think his nihilism appealed to younger teenagers, who I don't think really gave a shit how fucked up he really was. After he dropped the aggressive rap and started embracing the sparse, dejected R&B found on 17 and ?, I think he became a bit of a role model for teenagers with depression, who I think incorporated his fucked-up past into this recovery narrative to show that people can change and get better, etc. I'm personally not convinced that X was ever really held accountable for his crimes and I'm not sure he ever even appreciated that what he did was wrong. If I ever connected with him on a personal level, it was just the realization that X and I were born in the same year on the same continent, and our lives were somehow so starkly different that now he's dead and I'm alive. And it does make me wonder what causes a kid who seemingly had all the talent and potential in the world to throw away his life and future for clout.

9g8dxl,"They asked what my favorite song is and I showed them, they didn't judge but it ruined the song for me. This is why I don't show people my music, or the type of music I'm interested in.

It makes up everything about me, I see it as telling my life, culture, and feelings in a way that I can't convey and by showing that to someone, I feel like a part of me is being ripped out and exposed. I feel naked and it scars me in a way. Anyone else feel similar?","Showing people my music doesn't ruin it for me, but I can relate to me being hypercritical of the song when I'm showing it to others.

9qusrn,"Greta Van Fleet has been mentioned a few times in this community. Pitchfork just published their [review](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/greta-van-fleet-anthem-of-the-peaceful-army/) of the album. Do  you agree or disagree with their rating? Personally they're not my cup of tea, but with that being said, the review is rather scathing. ","They seem like a manufactured band to me. Like some record label got together and was like ""hey, nostalgia is really hot right now, let's make a retro band"" It all seems manufactured and going out of it's way to imitate the past. The clothes, the music. It's all been done before, zeppelin changed rock forever...but what they did to change has already been done, and is practically antiquity.  It's cool that they like zeppelin and stuff, and may was to revive and pay tribute to their influences, but you don't do that by completely copying shit. Zeppelin and Jeff Beck and those guys were paying homage to their blues and RnB heroes, but did it in a unique and fresh way. Distortion, loud drums, etc. In the 90s, those bands were doing the same thing Van Fleet is doing, but with their own spin on it. Soundgarden is very obviously Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, but they weren't zeppelin copies. For all the zeppelin copying, it's hard to believe these kids have the real knowledge to pull it off. When I was in my zeppelin phase, I was collecting live shows, I was tracing the origins of the songs they covered, I intimately knew the history and lineage of the songs, the yardbirds stuff...I know that Tangerine is derived from a Yardbirds song called Knowing That I'm Losing You I just feel like these kids don't know the history They don't have the spice or originality to last, they're flash in the pan, to be catalogued along side Wolfmother, the Darkness and Jet",345
9spnoa,"As I was entering my teenage years I decided to learn how to play the bass after attending my first concert and first discovering my love of music . For years everyday I spent 6-8 hours practicing, I loved playing the bass, it was my life . While discussing bass playing with other musicians on the internet I discovered some very talented bass players such as Jaco Pastorious and Victor Wooten. My tastes when I first started playing were mostly sophomoric pop punk music and as time went on I felt my tastes maturing. I started listening to the jazz stylings of some of the artists above , started exploring a lot of classic rock and listening to other ‚Äòmaestros‚Äô of their instruments such as Steve Vai. Gradually though I started to lose interest in all of this. After about 6 years of playing the bass nonstop daily I felt burnt out , the spark that brought me to the instrument was gone and I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to rekindle it. I finally came upon my epiphany , a realization that would change my musical tastes forever ; I hate jazz . There I said it, I cannot stand jazz music. The next question that followed really shed light on the situation, If I don‚Äôt like this music why did I spend so much time listening to it ? I find that specifically amongst musicians there is often this notion that the more complex a song is the better it is. I remember thinking this too; songs with simple bass lines became boring to me , I wanted to hear the instrument brought to the limits of its potential. As I began examining a lot of the music that I had listened to I discovered that I really didn‚Äôt like much of it ; I was only listening to it to appreciate the musicianship of the piece . I came to realize that music isn‚Äôt meant to be treated as a sport. It‚Äôs not meant to be a contest of who can play the most notes in a minute , who can tap the fastest, who can do the fastest drum roll, etc ... Playing an instrument as though it‚Äôs a video game, playing only to move onto a new level is completely missing the point of music. Music is meant to be experienced and felt, not just to be appreciated . Steve Vai, for those who don‚Äôt know, is quite possibly the most technically gifted guitarist I have ever heard. The things that man can do with a guitar is jaw dropping . However, at least in my opinion, Steve Vai could not write a good song to save his ass . His music is what I call guitar porn music. It isn‚Äôt made to be enjoyed per se, it‚Äôs the guitar equivalent of a gonzo film , it‚Äôs made for guitarists to blow their collective loads watching how fast he plays . As I said though , I don‚Äôt find his music to be good at all though , I really can‚Äôt see why anyone who isn‚Äôt a guitarist or musician would have any interest in listening to it. As a matter of fact , I would feel pretty comfortable assuming that at any given Steve Vai concert at least 90% of the crowd are musicians. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm not trying to say that musicianship is not important, but it is not any more important than any other aspect of songwriting . Writing a hook/riff, lyricism , creativity and innovation, etc... are just as important . You can write great music without being a great musician. After all this I came to realize that some of the music that I love the most is some of the simplest music. Music does not have to be complicated to be good . Play the music you love , and don‚Äôt fall for idol worship in the musician world.  I just wanted to share some of my thoughts, sorry if it‚Äôs a bit long winded I just wrote this post as a stream of consciousness . Of course it goes without saying that all of this is my opinion, if you truly love complex music with great musicianship then rock it, but I just want to try to dispel the notion that it‚Äôs the most important aspect when judging the quality of a piece of music ","I wish you gave some examples of ""simple music"" that you actually like. I'm curious what constitutes ""simple"" to you.  Bad music is bad, whether it's simple or complex. Both can be exhilarating and beautiful, and closing yourself off to either IS bad.  I'm actually kind of sad that you've just written off jazz all together. I'd love to know what jazz you were listening to that made you feel this way, because jazz is such a varied genre that I find it hard to believe that there wasn't something that appealed to you. Early Coltrane is beautiful, late Coltrane is harsh and energetic and sounds insane. Many jazz musicians went through something similar - the 60s and 70s were wild times for jazz. There's so much good stuff in jazz, though, that I wish you would reconsider. Avoid the technical stuff that bores you - plenty of people do. I just can't see how anyone would listen to Brad Mehldau or Fred Hersch and say it's technical garbage, for instance. Or Dexter Gordon. Or someone like Charlie Hunter, who has a more funk-based jazz that isn't super technical either (I won't get into his particular guitar-playing style - you can ignore it and the music still moves you.) Listen to jazz as music that explores, rather than exists as a technical exercise, and you may find a way back in. As for Steve Vai, yes, he can be ridiculously technical at times, but I find there's a lot of humor in his music that many people miss out on. He's a Zappa alumni so I'm pretty sure he's fully aware of the bombastic facade he and his music has. I mean, this is a guy who stands at the front of the stage with a big fan blowing his hair. He knows it's ridiculous. He's got some real compositional chops, however. This comes from a total non-musician, by the way.",127
9y8zr5,"25 years ago Nirvana recorded their famous ""MTV Unplugged in New York"" album on November 18, 1993. The album wouldn't be released until November 1st, 1994 ... approximately 7 months after the death of Kurt Cobain. It was an instant classic and is now considered one of the best live performances of all time. This album showcases not just Nirvana's musicianship but also Cobain's eclectic range of influences, from David Bowie, to Meat Puppets, and Leadbelly. Utilizing stylistic themes of a funeral ceremony in the stage design the performance was in stark contrast to the more carefree, energized shows Nirvana was usually associated with.  Anyway this is one of my favorite albums of all time and I am consistently pleasantly surprised when I return to it and find how well it has aged. Do you agree that this is one of the greatest live performances of all time? What do you think sets it apart (or doesn't set it apart) from other MTV Unplugged performances?","[A great article from The Ringer that I recommend any to any fan of Nirvana and/or their amazing Unplugged performance.](https://www.theringer.com/music/2018/11/14/18087878/nirvana-unplugged-oral-history-kurt-cobain) There are a lot of tidbits and details that I never knew and though lengthy, it's quite interesting from start to finish.",56
a2l7lt,"So, any mention of Talking Heads comes with a conversation about David Byrne's songwriting styles (abstract lyrics and strange, yet direct, views on society) and his eccentric stage presence; however, Tina Weymouth's bass lines are what makes the Talking Heads so iconic and enjoyable years after their time. Right from the get-go, their first ""hit"" [Psycho Killer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqQGWhge5yo),is driven by Tina Weymouth's sinister bass riff that drives the musings of Byrne's disturbed speaker. Moving on to [""Take Me To The River""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4azbl96BJY) (a cover of Al Green's song of the same name). Tina's bass, in addition to Chris Frantz' drumming, are a big factor in what makes the song so catchy and memorable. Fear of Music is where her Bass playing doesn't shine as much, it kind of takes a backseat to the guitar playing of Jerry Harrison and Byrne; but, the opener, [I Zimbra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFn66dzdz0), is another great bass-line from Weymouth. And then we get to Remain in Light, which is the album where her bass playing drives the album with a subtle hand, but it's still there in full force on songs like [Crosseyed and Painless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z92avHmgDRA), [Once In A Lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHatn3_UxEU), and [Houses In Motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt9_uyXgOzc). Then ""Speaking In Tongues"" brings out the best of Weymouth's Bass-playing in the Talking Heads with songs like [Girlfriend Is Better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7hC8p5DJ0) (Good luck getting that one out of your head), [Slippery People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx2_iHftARo), [Swamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15UWm0okgvA), [Moon Rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFUH4L3ZTUk), and [This Must Be The Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsccjsW8bSY). My point is this: Tina Weymouth's Bass Lines are the best part of a lot of Talking Head's music and she should be regarded as being one of the best bass players in the history of rock, but her significance and impact are often overshadowed by David Byrne's eccentric lyrics and stage presence. &#x200B; EDIT: I do regret generalizing Byrne to simple ""eccentricities"", because the man is really a genius when you get down to it and Talking Heads wouldn't have been Talking Heads without him. That being said, Talking Heads was at their best when David Byrne wasn't entirely in control of the songwriting process.",Does Tina write the bass lines or just play them? Not a huge talking heads fan so I don't know the answer.  If she doesn't then your take is moot. If she does write them then you have a point. But saying that David Byrne is just lyrics and stage presence seems like an undersell. Its much harder to be a song writer than it is to add bass lines to someone else songs. Its obvious but no one would care about her bass lines if it wasn't for the rest of the song.,46
a8ncbw,"There's been this totally weird obsession for Queen of all bands lately. They are no doubt an amazing band, don't get me wrong. I just think it's an ever-growing circle jerk. The band deserves respect, but it keeps getting crazier and crazier. First, Bohemian Rhapsody is not *nearly* as ambitious or revolutionary as people seem to think. Freddie Mercury, and the entire group were huge Beatles fans, AND Beach Boys. Now I know far too much about 60s and 70s music, but I will say that those two groups are basically the complete basis of Bohemian in the sense of how it works (not the genre) If you listen to A Day In The Life by the Beatles, now that was an ambitious song. Even ending the song with like a few dozen pianos all playing E. It's insane what went into it on a scale. And the song switches, etc. Also looking at the end of Abbey Road, it's also very similar. A medley. That's what Bohemian is. It's a medley. Bohemian came out in *1975*. That's only 5 years away from Abbey Road, and less than a decade from A Day In The Life. They were  massively influenced by The Beatles. I mean most UK artists were, obviously, at the time. Again, Bohemian Rhapsody IS a great song to me. But it didn't do anything groundbreaking. I mean even contemporaries of them were using harmonies in the same way and style. Electric Light Orchestra and many, many others. But all of these contemporaries were often looking to Beatles, Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan during the 70s, still. Just like how Breaking Bad and shows that are somewhat old, but not ancient, are still influential. With those three artists specifically, they did a lot to change songwriting, even to this day. Especially the mid sixties for all three artists. People know the Beatles story, but are usually pretty unaware of Beach Boys and especially Dylan. For example, if you think of Dylan as ""folk acoustic protest guy singing Blowin in the Wind"", it's like thinking Beatles only made She Loves You. [Here's an example of Dylan just a year or two later than that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AN2rfP6Wcc), if you're interested. Booed for being ahead of his time and ""betraying"" folk music. Then went into hiding. After these artists did so much, the 70s kept up with it in many ways, but also did new things. But Bohemian isn't really a great example of it. Back to the song! The vocal harmonies, again, are nothing revolutionary, no matter how good they are. Go listen to the mid sixties Beach Boys. If you listen to the original Smile sessions and Pet Sounds, you'll see what I mean with vocal harmonies tied with instruments. From a composer standpoint *that* was groundbreaking and ambitious. And as for the Bohemian movie, when everyone's like ""WOAH FREDDIE YOU'RE CRAZZZZY"", it wasn't like that at all. But with Smile by the Beach Boys, it actually *was like that*. They didn't even release the album! Just the genius album that was a bootleg until... recently.[Here's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YlJoGtH9lY). This is a weird song at first, but as you listen, you see the genius side of it. As Brian Wilson was going through a mental collapse, his music was far more experimental than his contemporaries **in regards to composition**. Paul McCartney (of the Beatles, in case someone has no clue what I'm talking about) was extremely obsessed with this sound, Brian Wilson's ""clean"" sound, and the vocal harmonies. The Beatles were essentially Beach Boys + Bob Dylan in many ways. Lennon and Harrison were absolutely crazy for Dylan, as they've said a million times. That's where the ambition comes from, it many ways. But from a sonic perspective of late Beatles, it's the Brian Wilson influence. Wilson also had an extreme influence of *classical and opera music in his works*. Of course both of these have a pretty common coincidence. They were tied to LSD use, and many bands were trying new things around then.  Also, Beach Boys of the mid-sixties is nothing like Surfin USA or what you see on Sonic commercials, by the way. It was drastically different, just like The Beatles went from She Loves You to A Day In The Life. My point is that Queen *IS* a great band, but this circle jerk keeps building and it's so strange. If you look at the mid 60s acts, there was literally **nothing** like that before them. It was a whole new world sonically due to a lot happening at once. Not just LSD and pot, or new audio technology. It was many factors. Bohemian Rhapsody is a great song in so many ways. It's catchy, and is heartfelt. But it damn sure didn't do anything that hadn't been done before. I think something like A Day In The Life is truly something that had no true predecessor. Some people say  70s Queen is essentially Beatles + Beach Boys + Led Zeppelin. And that's not exactly hard to see. They blended it in their own special way and did do some very interesting stuff, of course! Many of their songs were VERY influential on the music scene, especially later than Bohemian Rhapsody. My point is that I'm in no way just shitting on the band. My point is that the circlejerk of Bohemian Rhapsody is so weird, as they've all said ""We were never a cool band"" in documentaries about themselves. Now they're this cool band to like or whatever all of a sudden, and it's interesting. My point is that, while Bohemian Rhapsody never did anything truly revolutionary, and didn't ""revolutionize music"", it's still a great song. But acting like it is tells me you haven't hear much music from the previous decade. ","Please don't think I'm jumping down your throat, as the tone in my head when I write this is super sweet and motherly about it, but I can't help but feel like this is a knee jerk thing toward the popularity of the song in the aftermath of the movie that just came out. Yes, there is hype, and deservedly so. Bohemian Rhapsody is not less epic because songs like ""A Day In The Life"" exist, or less impressive because of work done by the Beach Boys, or anybody else for that matter. I think you're taking it too seriously that people are in fact discovering the song/band for the first time and are rightfully impressed by it. It is a great song, regardless of what musical grounds it did or did not break, and irrespective of whatever fanfare moments the movie drums up to make it seem more powerful in the moment. The magic of Bohemian Rhapsody isn't its melodic orchestration or rock-out moment, but rather the shared experience of such a ridiculous and spectacular song. Figuring out who hits the high vs. low ""Galileo!"" or watching everyone lock into their respective air instruments when the time comes. It's an experience made all the better with more people who also love it. THAT'S the magic this song has that almost no other anthem does. I guess all I'm saying is don't worry about it because maybe the people in question actually haven't heard much from the previous decades. Don't belittle them, though, as we were all new to great music at some point or another. If anything, just be happy new generations are looking back on musical legacies of generations before them and actually paying attention.",239
ad5r0g,"Most people seem to hate U2. A lot of this hatred puzzles me a little bit. This is my analysis of the phenomenon, and some of the reasons why I find it weird. I want to make one thing clear: I am a fan, but in no way do I think U2 is objectively good in any way: I just happen to like them personally. I completely understand that people like different things. The purpose of this post isn't to say everybody should like U2. I write these opinions conscious of the fact that I'm biased, but still trying to avoid the bias as much as I can. I truly believe there's an objective discussion to be had here.  1. ""The free album on itunes!"" : Didn't like it myself, but I don't understand why anyone would get mad about it.  It was just a minor annoyance that happened years ago. 2. ""Bono is annoying and full of himself!"": Yeah he is but I only care about the music he makes. Why does it matter? A lot of artists are annoying. I simply don't understand why this bothers people so much. 3. ""All of it sounds the same!"" Yes, U2 have a recognizable sound. So does Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Oasis, Iron Maiden and many others. This is usually only a problem if the listener doesn't like the recognizable sound, which is a different conversation altogether. 4. ""Their new music sucks!"" This happens to basically every artist. 5. ""They lack technical skill!"" Yeah they do but they are a pop band. Since when has super technical musicianship been relevant in pop music? This seems more like a criticism of pop itself weirdly directed at U2.  6.""Their music is generic, simple and too safe!"" I'll try not to sound too much like a stan here, because I have something objective to say about this. Everyone is free to have their own opinion, but this opinion just sounds like something you would say if you never actually listened to U2 (or only the new stuff, and in that case you could say this about nearly any band). Just because something is popular people like to assume it's generic. I actually believe U2 created a unique sound: for example, their guitar sound is unique (or at least stood/stands out in mainstream guitar music) and absolutely central to their musical identity. I also don't think their music is safe: I think you could objectively say it at least attempts to be sincere, grandiose, shameless and very emotional. It often seems like people think positive music = safe (not true), whereas dark music supposedly isn't (dark and heavy music can be safe too, it all depends on the execution of it).  Everyone is allowed to have an opinion, but these arguments seem a bit weird to me. Personally I think a lot of the hate (other than people just not liking the music which I completely get) comes from these reasons 1. They're huge and people want to be contrarian. 2. U2's music is positive and people want to like edgy/dark music to be cool. 3. Everyone is already supposed to hate U2.  Any thoughts on this? Am I onto something? Or are there some things that I, as a fan, am getting totally wrong? I guess I just think it's sad to miss out on music for unnecessary reasons.","The Joshua Tree is an incredible album, one of the greatest albums in its genre.  Bono and U2 are tax dodgers and hypocrites, pretending to save the world from poverty and hunger whilst hoarding tax revenue in overseas avoidance schemes.",158
ak8ptc,"""Field recordings"" are usually thought of as being recordings of ambient, natural sound -- like birds, or footsteps, or people speaking to each other at a park, or rainfall, or passing traffic.  Over the last few months I've been getting pretty deep into ambient music and realized that the use of field recordings along with traditional instruments and beats is really effective IMO. It makes you feel like you're getting a glimpse into a moment that no longer exists. Possibly my favorite example of this is found in Neighborhoods by Ernest Hood which extensively features field recordings of ... well... Neighborhoods: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUdSrNAgr2Y Another one that I recently discovered and that I really enjoy is Robert Millis's album, ""120"" (not available for full streaming online but there is this excerpt below that you can listen to):  https://soundcloud.com/miguel-copon/sets/robert-millis-120-excerpt The of course there are straight up ambient nature recordings such as the ""Environments"" series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmJ3vWAPqhM These recordings just make me feel really relaxed and grounded. They provide a sort of escapism, almost.  Do you enjoy the use of field recordings in music? Or are they boring or distracting to you? What are some of your favorite albums/songs that make use of field recordings? I'm sure examples exist outside of the experimental artists I mentioned above. ","I've got a lot of time for field recordings for the same reasons you give; they can create a unique vibe that is literally impossible to recreate with just instruments. I like how you put it: a glimpse into a moment that no longer exists. Godspeed You! Black Emperor and their associated acts use this approach very well in my opinion, incorporating the sounds of urban life and mechanical/electrical ambience in their work to create a stark, cold and lonely feel to their lengthy tracks. In particular, the associated act Set Fire To Flames created something rather special with their first release ""Sings Reigns Rebuilder."" This album contains many imperfections, floorboards creaking and ambient sound while recording. In one song, a police car drives past while recording and you can hear the guitarist almost flinch a little as the song closes but he finishes the take, perhaps instinctively knowing that it was a serendipitous way to end the track. If this was to be purposefully recreated, the effect would be gone, it'd be too planned, too perfect. Some of the tracks are melodic and emotional, whereas others are tape loops of popping static, noise, hum made from broken/tweaked equipment. These tracks are the ones that might make it a somewhat difficult listening experience for some - after a short but beautiful intro track, the second is a 14 minute stretch of droning, atonal, amelodic, barely rhythmic sound. But the atmosphere created by these tracks, combined with the snippets of interviews with some...interesting characters (complete with street noise) create an almost indescribable atmosphere of despondence and resignation that yet also seems to strive for beauty and personality in the chaos and callousness of modern life. [edit: and I'm not just making that up, another associated act Silver Mt. Zion reflects this in their lyrical themes] The other effect of having these amelodic tracks is that when it's time for the more traditional music, your ears really hone in on the familiar sound and the songs have more significance for it. This is exemplefied in the glorious, devastating, 11 minute dark post-rock track ""Shit-Heap Gloria of the New Town Planning"" which looms and builds before clattering into that sense of emotional desperation that Godspeed etc. do so well. While I recommend the full album, if you don't have 73 minutes to spare then just listen to 20 minutes from the timestamp: https://youtu.be/Mdpx3Ory1Yk?t=2563 So yeah, in my listening experience, field recordings can absolutely have a strong effect, both by themselves and as an addition or counterpoint to traditional music.",50
apl7gt,"For those who don't know what RateYourMusic is, RateYourMusic is a website where anyone can rate an album from a scale of 0.5 to 5 (5 being the best). These ratings are averaged and ranked. You can find out what is the best album of 2018 or the best neo-soul album of all time through the website. It's really a powerful tool to find out a lot of good music. Inspired by watching the yesterdays Grammy's, I wanted to find out what would the outcome of Album of the Year be if the album with the highest RateYourMusic rating won out of the nominees. Ok so here were the Album of the Year winners for the past 20 years and their ratings and rank on RateYourMusic  Year | Artist | Album | Rating | Rank for the Year ----|------|-----|------|----------------- 2000 | Santana | Super Natural | 3.09 | 1000+ 2001    |Steely Dan    |Two Against Nature    |3.39    |685 2002    |Various Artists    |O Brother, Where Art Thou?

So what does that mean? Generally on RateYourMusic anything below a rating of a 3 is subpar. A rating of 3-3.3 is a fine rating but the album is nothing spectacular. A rating of 3.3-3.6 is a good album that has some special quality but it‚Äôs lacking something in a way that makes a great album. A rating of 3.6-4.0 means that it‚Äôs a great quality album that‚Äôs shy of being a masterpiece. Anything beyond a 4.0 is rare. Only 6 albums since 2010 have had a rating of 4.0 or higher. If an album has a rating beyond 4.0 it means that it‚Äôs a damn good album and likely to be influential to the genre.  A rating of 3.24 is disappointing. Let‚Äôs see how much the average will increase if we let RateYourMusic decide the winner of Album of The Year by selecting the album with the highest rating out of the nominees.  Year | Artist | Album | Rating | Rank for the Year | Rating Increase ----|------|-----|------|-----------------|---------- 2000 |Dixie Chicks |Fly |3.45 |591 | 0.36 2001 |Radiohead |Kid A |4.21 |1 | 0.82 2002 |Various Artists |O Brother, Where Art Thou?

That's a 0.5 increase in rating. Not Bad. **Takeaways** * Kendrick Lamar is the unluckiest Artist. He has lost 3 opportunities for Album of the Year where he should've won. To add insult to injury, his album ""To Pimp a Butterfly"" which has a 4.16 rating lost to Taylor Swift's ""1989"" which has a 2.97 rating. That's a difference of 1.19, the largest difference between the best rated nominee and the actual winner of AOTY in 20 years.  * Radiohead and Kanye West are also greats who have not won Album of the Year. Both have been nominated 3 times and lost 3 times. ""My Dark twisted Beautiful Fantasy"" by Kanye wasn't even nominated for AOTY even though it's considered one of the best albums from the 2010s.  * The Grammy's picked the highest rated nominee twice in twenty years. Once in 2002 with the soundtrack for ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and the second time with ""The suburbs"" from Arcade Fire winning.  * ""Back to Black"" would be the highest ranked nominee for the 2008 grammy's, but apparently VInce Gill's ""these days"" have a higher rating. It can be attributed to lower amount of raters for Vince Gill's Album. The same can be said for Outkast's Stankonia where it is higher ranked than ""O Brother, Where art thou?"".  * The Grammy's like to throw in odd curve balls once in a while. Ray Charles, Herbie Hancock, Beck all had higher rated albums back in the day. But somehow they win AOTY with a weaker album.  ",I‚Äôll never forget when the year was Beck‚Äôs Odelay vs. Smashing Pumpkins‚Äô Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness.  And the Grammy went to... Celine Dion.  I swore to never watch it again.  And I almost didn‚Äôt watch it ever again until I saw that Trent Reznor was playing with QOTSA. And the Grammys cut the set short and i flogged myself for breaking my vow.

awtzj2,"Almost without exception, whenever I've heard someone say they listen to ""everything but rap and country,"" it's been said with a particular sort of nose-up disdain that rubs me the wrong way. If a person listens to *everything*, then some country is quite close to blues or rock, and some rap is close to R&B or spoken word poetry. Both genres have artists whose lyrics are insightful and moving. So what's the stigma? The two are frequently listed as a matched set. What they share in common is a blue collar listening demographic, whether from the ""sticks"" or the ""hood.""

b19zhf,"I was re-watching this and thought he was drawing a lot of ridiculous conclusions based off of his own biases and misunderstanding of musical history, and packaging it in such a way to shit on an entire generation of people. He comes off as so smug in spite of the fact that most of what he's saying is uneducated and ignorant. It kind of pisses me off.  He basically cherrypicks examples of music from the '60s and '70s in an attempt to illustrate how bad music has gotten since then. He points to ""A Day in the Life"" by the Beatles as an example of a huge pop song from back then, because it had a big orchestra and he wanted to use that as a ding against millennial music. He left out a few things, probably deliberately in order to strengthen the point of his video.  1) That song did not chart. In fact, The Beatles never officially released it as a single. So the fact that he uses this to compare to the charts nowadays is bullshit.  2) He uses the fact that ""A Day in the Life"" has a lot of musicians as evidence that it could never have made it in today's music atmosphere, or otherwise imply that music today isn't collaborative like that. This is also bullshit. The biggest album of 2015 in terms of critical acclaim and one of the biggest in terms of sales was *To Pimp a Butterfly*, which has a huge amount of collaborators, including full jazz bands on a few tracks. [Look at the Discogs info](https://www.discogs.com/Kendrick-Lamar-To-Pimp-A-Butterfly/release/7557957) for the album if you want a clear idea of how many people were working on some of those tracks. He has no excuse for not knowing about this album, considering he made his video in 2017. So he just didn't do his research before making the video, or he just didn't care. 3) Sgt Pepper's was extraordinary by the standards of 1967, and the reason he immediately jumped to the Beatles for comparison is because nobody was doing the shit they were doing even back then. (I say ""nobody"" very generally here, so don't come at me with *Pet Sounds*; you know what I mean dammit). He could have used ""A Day in the Life"" to show how nobody was making music like that in 1967, but because he has an axe to grind and he's a dishonest turd, he used it to show how nobody is making music like that today. Then he uses that fact to condemn all of modern music and praise all of the music back then. You can't use a single song or even a single album to represent an entire generation of music. There's a reason you can't say all music in the early '90s was great just because of *Loveless* and *Nevermind*. It's because there were a lot of tacky rip-offs of My Bloody Valentine and Nirvana who couldn't even touch what they were doing sonically. Same goes for *Sgt Pepper's*. Same goes for *To Pimp a Butterfly*. These are generation-defining albums, but they don't really accurately represent those generations in full.  He also fixates on how ""all music is essentially written by these two guys Max Martin and Shellback"", when that's absurdly overstating the actual impact they've had on the industry. Since they stopped collaborating with Taylor Swift, they've written maybe 2 songs that went #1 on the Billboard Top 100. Anybody who has actually been paying attention knows that people like Jack Antonoff and Greg Kurstin are much more relevant now than Martin and Shellback. But thoughty2 hasn't been paying attention, because it doesn't help his argument, and because he's out-of-touch with the good music being made now. Honestly, I'm not sure if he's just baiting people into clicking his video and he knows all of what he's saying is bullshit, or if he actually believes what he's saying because he's a Paul Joseph Watson type who distorts history and culture to fit his prejudiced preconceptions. It could be either. ","Okay, so I'm watching it now. For the record, I dislike mainstream pop post-60s in general, so that may tint my opinion. So far, your criticism seems apt. ""How did we get from The Beatles to Justin Bieber?"" IDK, how did we get from Herman's Hermits to Animals as Leaders? ""Cherry-picking"" indeed. Okay, I am interested in this study he's talking about. ""Timbral variety"" has declined. Songs have less internal diversity. Now he's jizzing over ""A Day in the Life."" Pausing because I think I see what he's missing here. And, okay, I'll grant, some scientists scienced up some science to determine this. I'll believe them. Great. I think the key phrase that he uses without reflection is that the songs were samples from ""all genres."" But there are *a metric fuckton* of genres now that didn't exist in the 60s. Back then, rap was still spoken word, metal was ""the worst song on the White Album,"" rock and pop were still pretty much the same thing, the technology to produce most electronica was non-existent or in its infancy. And once you invoke sub-genres and their sub-genres (the way a hardcore metalhead can tell you the difference between ""Extra-Blackified Stoner Death-Doomgaze"" and ""Extra-Deathified Stoner Black-Doomgaze""), you can easily see that contemporary music on the whole has way *more* diversity, it's just that individual songs are more specialized. Yeah, a 60s pop/rock song might have a bit more *internal* variety in its timber, but I can listen to Hooverphonic's ""Someone"" and Ministry's ""Thieves"" back-to-back. So take that. ""Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' uses mostly one instrument - a drum machine."" First off, congratulations on discovering minimalism. Secondly, again, now you're strictly talking ""pop,"" and genres are more specialized. Hence the fact that pop songs use the same elements - they're doing something more specific than ""pop"" songs were back when ""pop"" was conflated with rock and neither had yet spawned sub-movements. Jesus I'm defending contemporary mainstream pop. That's how you know this argument sucks. Okay now you're identifying the Millennial Whoop. And I won't defend that thing under any circumstance. And back in the 80s we were inundated with bouncy synths and cheesy sax solos. More broadly, what you're saying is less ""there's this music-killing virus infecting our minds"" and really more like ""I'm pointing to a super-annoying Top 40 quirk currently popular."" Top 40 music has always suffered annoying trends. And yes there's science to point to increasing homogenization but I reiterate, ""Top 40 pop"" now seems to mean something more specific than it did in decades past because of genre specialization. Your mistake is listening to the radio. I think it's romantic in theory, too, but it's a graveyard of a medium. Christ, we're only six minutes into this shit? Okay, lyrics lyrics lyrics. I don't give a shit about lyrics honestly. Half of my favorite songs are basically lyrical gibberish anyway. I'm an English PhD student, I've taught a poetry course, most song lyrics are painfully trite poetry at best. They only matter in terms of how they interact with the vocals. If the voice makes pretty sounds mouthing complete horseshit, fine. My current obsessive re-listen is Pati Yang, and if you can explain the lyrics to ""Giant Cat Woman,"" don't. I prefer it as gibberish that sounds fun in Yang's surreal British accent. (She's Polish. Go figure.) Point is, when I want to be impressed with poetry, I'll re-read Paradise Lost for the dozenth time. So I don't care about this part. Also, yes, the same dude wrote all this shit, it's a factory system. That's why it's ""corporate."" If you want to hear music Max Martin didn't write, I reiterate, *turn off the fucking radio.* OH WAIT ""But you have to look really, really hard"" to find ""popular, chart-topping hits"" where the artist wrote all the music and lyrics? **MOTHERFUCKER IF IT'S ""POPULAR"" AND ""CHART-TOPPING"" YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL JFC** no really I replayed it I fucking tutor nine-year-olds with more of a grasp on basic logic than this. Christ. Kids, this is why, when your professor offers you an opportunity to discuss a first draft in office hours, *take them up on it.* This is where you catch that really egregious shit. He could've probably been in a solid B range if he's run this past me first and then revised accordingly. Okay there's a point in the way that changing avenues of musical engagement leading to greater on-demand availability has affected our attention spans. That's worth considering, although, since half of up are holding our breaths for a new Tool album, it's certainly far from universal. That said, this is technology and audience reception and production all meeting in a matrix defined by the commodification of art. Thank you for finally saying something non-idiotic. This is where your actual point lies if you have one, please remember this for your second draft. Oh, the Loudness Wars. Yeah I think the value of perceived loudness is a circumstantial one depending on the tone of the song, although the demonstration is valuable. I'm not well-versed in production, but it is perhaps regrettable that economic pressures encouraged it more widely? At any rate, this is kind of interesting and should be a focus of your second draft, after you excise the bullshit in the first half. Okay, I'm ready to say, he has some points in the latter half but some astonishingly dumb ones in the first. He's trying to make the wrong narrative out of his facts (""ill-defined 'pop' music was better back then"" rather than ""Certain social, technical, and economic factors currently reinforce a set of artistically-regrettable tendencies in contemporary corporate music""). But wait mofo's still playing and saying some dumb shit in conclusion. Mere exposure effect is definitely a thing, but ""if it was truly a great song you would have gotten it the first time"" is just intellectually lazy. How the hell many times do we discuss on this very sub how many songs we needed to hear a few times to ""get"" them? Extremely simple music might just worm its way into your brain, but extremely complex music might take an educational few re-listens, and anyway there is such a thing as ""acquired taste."" I thought bebop was ""noise"" until I learned to appreciate its anarchic complexity; I didn't just ""get"" it the first time I heard Coltrane in passing. I feel like in a way this commits the same logical error as does St. Anselm's ontological argument - treating ""goodness"" as a trait that inheres in something, rather than a value-judgement subjectively imposed on distinct phenomena. You can't just listen to a song and necessarily appreciate in some objective fashion how ""good"" it is, because there's no inherent ""goodness"" to hear (or not). You need to learn what it is that you're listening to in order to know how to evaluate it according to a standard of ""goodness,"" and that's not necessarily obvious or intuitive. I guess that's it, thanks for coming to my fuckin' TED Talk. EDIT: ""Phenomenon"" is singular, ""phenomena"" is plural.",153

b45k48,"I firmly believe that you can manually shift your music taste. I can talk from experience. Last year, I listened to a select few genres, ranging from IDM to trance to jazz. I didn't really fancy classic rock music as whole that much though, same with trap rap music as well. For years I always listened to it with my friends and it never ever clicked for me, and I always told myself I would never enjoy it. In December of last year I decided to radically overhaul my music taste and literally listen to whatever artist/name I heard of. I forced myself to expect to like everything that I listened to, classic rock and trap included. Now I can say that I fully enjoy rock music, and trap as well. In the beginning it took time, but it quickly grew on me because I completely abandoned all negative assumptions I had about that music. I'm at the point now where I can literally enjoy anything I hear. It might not click right away, but 99 percent of the time it grows on me after 2 or 3 more listens. I am in fucking love with music, I have nothing against any genre. An added bonus is that I can almost always have some overlap in music taste with anyone I meet which is great for getting to know people. It's honestly the best way to enjoy music. I really don't want to come off as a pretentious snob, I'm just expressing how great this is. If something doesn't click for you, with the right perspective you can usually start to enjoy it. I now enjoy stuff from noise to sludge metal to synth-wave to classical etc. Music has never been so important to me. I'm very curious what you think about this method of music listening and if you relate/disagree. Thanks!","You'll hear this described in terms of what's called the ""mere-exposure effect"" - just becoming familiar with something tends to make people like it more. Personally, I don't get it. If i don't like something, I don't listen to it. I'm not ""scoring"" myself on breadth of taste. If anything, quite the opposite - I'm happier with my music collection the more it specifically feels tailored to what I personally value. Yeah, there's tons of ""great,"" critically-acclaimed, widely-loved music that I have no familiarity with, and I think it's cool that people appreciate it, and it probably deserves to be appreciated. That doesn't mean I have to be the one doing the appreciating. I prefer to know a few nooks and crannies intimately and explore them deeply, rather than enjoy a little bit of everything.",122
bb9szx,"I have no idea why she's getting critical and commercial success, from what I've heard off her new album (which has a truly cringe inducing name, that's trying too hard to be deep) she's pretty much the 17 year old version of Lana Del Ray, with a little less piano and more bass. It seems her debut album is yet another extremely generic and boring indie pop album with no memorable tracks. Her voice isn't unique, nor are her instrumentals and her lyrics and themes are just as bland. I also dislike that she's written her track names in lowercase, I feel as if that's just a cheap attempt to be more original. If you're not going to do anything experimental on an album, at least make sure the tracks are memorable and keep the listener's attention.","The sub is called ""Let's Talk Music"" because it was originally meant to be a hub for *rich, in-depth discussion about music*. My own feelings about the sub's direction notwithstanding, coming here and saying ""Artist X is trash"" isn't a good-faith effort at starting a conversation and should be discouraged.",22
bfw5oi,"This mindset doesn't necessarily apply to people on this sub, but in general people who don't listen to rap besides what they're forced to hear will probably find this blasphemous. ""Isn't lyricism at an all-time low for any genre?"" ""I'm tired of hearing about money, drugs, and hoes."" ""Everything sounds the same."" And so on. If you're just subjected to a radio rotation including Drake, Post Malone, Migos, Lil Baby, Cardi B, Nicki, Swae Lee, French Montana, Lil Pump, G-Eazy, XXX, Lil Yachty, 21 Savage, Kodak Black, Lil Skies, etc, then yeah, you're going to grow tired of it. And listen, I like some Drake songs here and there, but it's clear he's at the point in his career where he's following a very specific and boring hitmaking formula, and it's bringing in the money so props to him. Looking beyond the front of the mainstream though, there's some really interesting stuff going on in the hip hop scene. There's more variety in sound and style in rap right now than there's ever been, and so there's truly something for everyone if you look hard enough. Here's just 20 unique albums released in the past few years to showcase what kind of active talent there is in rap right now: **Experimental Hip Hop:** * **Kids See Ghosts** \- Kids See Ghosts (2018): Collaboration between Kanye West and Kid Cudi, all killer, no filler. The beats are strange, psychedelic, and layered so you get more out of them with every listen. The instrumentals incorporate rock, noise, and other genres in really creative ways. You get to follow Kanye and Cudi's therapeutic journey through their depression, mental health struggles, and creative blocks, and by the end you feel as uplifted as they are. I can't point to another album that really sounds anything like it. My personal favorite album of 2018. * **Atrocity Exhibition** \- Danny Brown (2016): This feels like a drug-induced descent into absolute madness. Brown's voice is high pitched and yappy, almost like a chihuahua, but it just works once you grow used to it. The beats are noisy, dark, and manic, and Danny is an intense and emotional rapper who takes us through some of the horrors he's seen and felt growing up in an impoverished Detroit neighborhood and becoming an adult with a myriad of other issues, including substance addiction. **Trap Sucks Though:** * **TA13OO** \- Denzel Curry (2018): Denzel blends a lot of different current trends going on in rap here. That melodic sing-rapping. The aggressive metal-influenced scream-rapping. The introspection and sadness of the ""emo wave."" Lots of variation in styles of beats across the project. But unlike a lot of the relatively inexperienced guys coming from SoundCloud, Denzel does it all really well. * **Rodeo** \- Travis Scott (2015): Okay, I'm cheating here. This came out a few years ago, and I probably should've put Astroworld in its place since it came out last year, but while Astroworld isn't bad, Rodeo is just better, so if you're choosing one you haven't heard before in full I'd suggest that one. Travis has really perfected his sound by crafting a dark, distorted autotune around his voice which sounds great over his heavy and atmospheric production. The beats are constantly changing and evolving to keep things interesting. Lyrics aren't a major focus here, so you'll get plenty of hedonism, but they're fun and with production this great, they don't detract from it. **Where Them Girls At?:** * **Grey Area** \- Little Simz (2019): She's a super talented and charismatic UK rapper. For you fans of ""reaaal"" instruments, there is an abundance of that here. It's fun but also really heartfelt, as she gives us a lot of insight into who Little Simz is as a person. It's not a rap boundary-expanding release; it's just really, really good from back to front and there aren't any weak points on the album. It's too early, but this is my frontrunner for album of the year right now. * **Room 25** \- Noname (2018): She's from Chicago, and it's crazy what's bubbling in that scene after the drill phase we hd coming out of there a few years ago. The positive and uplifting, gospel and neo-soul influenced rap couldn't be any further from that. The beats are lush and dreamy, and Noname has a pretty rap voice that's really easy to listen to. Before rapping she started her career writing poetry, and it's pretty easy to tell that once you hear her on the mic. It's a very honest and calming project. **Where Are the Good Lyricists?:** * **Some Rap Songs** \- Earl Sweatshirt (2018): Earl might honestly be the most talented rapper today in terms of technical ability. When you first hear it, you'll think there's some major issues with the mixing, but it's intended for it to sound like Earl's vocals are drowned in the beat. He's been depressed for a long time, and you can really feel his pain through his delivery, which seems emotionally broken. The lo-fi, repeitive, jazzy production and Earl's heavy voice and poetic style of rapping sound great against one another. If you've ever heard Madvillainy, think of this as a much sadder version of that. * **DAMN** \- Kendrick Lamar (2017) - Even if you don't pay attention to rap, you're aware of Kendrick. In contrast to his past albums which focused more on the plights of black people and the inner-city poor at large, he's more inward looking here as he discusses his own destiny in America. If you need any convincing of the significance of his content and ability to tell a story, Kendrick won a Pulitzer Prize for this album, making it the first non-jazz or classical project to win the honor. As far as the beat selection, it's really hard to describe them holistically. They can be dark, depressing, entrancing, aggressive, glitchy, and more, all while Kendrick utilizes different voices and characters to match each one. * **Hiding Places** \- Billy Woods (2019) - If you really like lyrics you can go back to and pick apart, this is a great album for that. Woods is a dark, poetic, and abstract lyricist, and even when you're not fully understanding what he's talking about he paints such a vivid menacing picture of his rough upbringing and struggles in life. The experience of the album feels like what the cover shows. It's like entering a haunted house full of horrors and you don't have anything to protect yourself with. This thing is really, really bleak. And the beats produced by Kenny Segal create a really dark atmosphere, and you really have to appreciate all the instrumentation included in the production. * **Malibu Ken** \- Malibu Ken (2019): You won't find a bigger vocabulary in hip hop than what's in Aesop Rock's arsenal. He collaborates with electronic musician Tobacco to create a wonky, mechanical sounding album while providing his usual complex, abstract lyricism. It's weird, different, and fun. **None of that Mumble Rap Shit:** * **JEFFERY** \- Young Thug (2016): One of the OG mumblers! Okay, I had to reach a little further back for this one, but this is still Thug's best project to date. It's honestly best to just think of his voice as an instrument. He uses it in a really interesting and creative way to flow and bounce over the beat. His stretchy delivery constantly has him changing rapping tempo, abruptly altering his pitch, switching to crooning, and so on. And if you're not a stickler about lyrics and topics needing to be super complex and thought-provoking, Thugger's blunt, wild, and hyper nature can be pretty fun to listen to. He doesn't take himself seriously and you shouldn't either. * **Die Lit** \- Playboi Carti (2018): Yeah...this one will definitely be the hardest pitch to non-rap fans. It's a surprisingly forward-thinking album though. This is essentially post-trap, because really, there's not all that much traditional rapping here. Carti opts for a lot of ad-libbing, while engulfing you in these intoxicating and hypnotic beats. What Carti is saying hardly matters; you just have to kind of let yourself get lost in it. Die Lit is brainless, energetic, and fun. And he's perfectly well aware of how he's perceived: ""Fuck that mumbling shit, bought a crib for my my mama off that mumbling shit, made a mil off that, uh...off that mumbling shit."" But he doesn't care. It rejects all the standards and traditions of the genre for a more primitive and even punkish approach. **cRap Isn't Music:** * **Avantdale Bowling Club** \- Avantdale Bowling Club (2018): The tracks are actual organic compositions by New Zealand artist Tom Scott. Is this jazz-rap or rap-jazz? It's hard to pick, but this is definitely one of the coolest releases of last year and if you like the full-scale live jazz instrumentation of To Pimp a Butterfly, you should dig this, too. The lyrics are conscious and introspective, focusing on Tom's growth from a disadvantage and risk-taking youth into a mature father who has to deal with the everyday stresses of life. **If You Miss that Boom Bap Aesthetic:** * **All-Amerikkkan Bada$$** \- Joey Bada$$ (2017): Joey has the coldest, most vicious voice and delivery in rap. That masculine, confident tone will definitely give you a throwback to the 90s. But it's not exactly something that's stuck in the past, because it incorporates plenty of newer elements of rap in the production, as well. On this album, he discusses and dissects the current state of black people in America, so for those of you who like to mix in some social messages and politics with your music, look no further. Make no mistake though, you can take it and enjoy it as just a fun listen, as well. * **Daytona** \- Pusha T (2018) - Honestly, I might've lied about Joey having the coldest, most vicious voice and delivery. Pusha T is an aggressive, unapologetic drug dealer who sounds every bit the part. At 7 tracks, the album is cohesive and dense, and Kanye produced it all, so it sounds great. Also, if you think real rap beef and dissing doesn't exist anymore, think again. Pusha takes shots at Drake on this album, genuinely stemming from hate towards him, and once the ante is upped even further with the response track from Drake, Pusha delivers the knockout blow with ""The Story of Adidon"" in which he essentially tears apart every aspect of Drake's lifestyle. **LGBTQ Rappers:** * **Flower Boy** \- Tyler, the Creator (2017) - Who would've imagined an openly bisexual rapper in the early stages of rap, given the rampant homophobia in the genre? Tyler is a super talented producer with a wealth of musical knowledge and he uses it to craft incredible warm neo-soul and synth funk instrumentals that flow really well into each other. We learn a lot about Tyler on this project. He's done with his edgy days and explores his feelings of loneliness, boredom, and dissatisfaction. Each song looks into different aspects of these themes, and he gives subtle hints throughout the album that he's bisexual, which is another factor that's probably made him feel so isolated. * **Saturation I-III** \- Brockhampton (2017) - Diverse in sexual orientation and race, they're a self-proclaimed ""boy band."" They're style is mostly pop rap, and with so many members, each one is constantly jumping in and out of the tracks to inject their own passion and enthusiasm. The guys are young and hungry, and they discuss a variety of topics like sexuality, materialism, mental health, religion, racism, and a lot more. That's the cool part about having a collective this big. They all have something to say and so it keeps the topics fresh and interesting. **Something More Abrasive:** * **Year of the Snitch** \- Death Grips (2018) - This band really tiptoes the line of what can even be considered hip hop. They're very noisy, industrial, chaotic, and punk, but there's definitely still rapping here, too. Zach Hill is a prolific drummer and MC Ride is the crazy, uber-aggressive, nihilistic lyricist. On this album they incorporate more elements of electronic music, psychedelic rock, and even some jazz. The lyrics are really abstract, and suggest feelings of fear, anxiety, and paranoia towards the world around them, and the Internet's partial role in all of this is emphasized throughout the project. * **Veteran -** JPEGMAFIA (2018) - Veteran is similar to Death Grips' work with its noisy and aggressive nature, but it's definitely very different. The production feels more glitchy, less heavy, more catchy, and Peggy is closer to what you'd hear from traditional rappers, while Ride is more of a yeller. The lyrics and themes are something I think would really appeal to younger generations. You'll find a lot of dark humor, political and social unrest,and aggression towards basically any group of people you can think of, from the alt-right to SoundCloud rappers to misogynists and feminists to music critics and so on. In this album, Peggy basically plays a more absurd, exaggerated version of himself. **Old Guys Still Kicking It:** * **4:44 -** Jay-Z (2017) - At near 50 years old, Jay released his strongest project in nearly 15 years. You get a lot of traditional East coast hip hop beats, and on the album you get the sense that he's a wise and experienced guy in the game who has a lot to reflect on now, because he talks about a lot of things he's rarely discussed in prior projects, including his family life, racism, his relationships with friends and his wife, and the state of rap. The album shows that Hov still has good material left in him, so long as he's motivated. **Others:** And then you've got plenty of other really talented artists who have recently released really good material like: * J.I.D. (DiCaprio 2) * Big KRIT (4eva is a Mighty Long Time) * Anderson .Paak (Ventura) * Vince Staples (Big Fish Theory) * Lupe Fiasco (Drogas Wave) * Quelle Chris (Guns) * Saba (Care for Me) * Rapsody (Laila's Wisdom) * Lil Wayne (Tha Carter V) * ASAP Rocky (TESTING) * Tierra Whack (Whack World) * Ka (Orpheus vs. the Sirens) * Jean Grae (Everything's Fine) * Young Fathers (Cocoa Sugar) As well as ones who should be releasing projects in the near future: * Kanye West (his next  solo album Yandhi has been delayed but hopefully it'll be in 2019) * The Roots (End Game is supposed to release later this year) * Freddie Gibbs (Bandana, a Madlib collab, is scheduled to release next month) * Run the Jewels (RTJ4 is rumored for later this year) * Chance the Rapper (supposed to release an album this year) * Schoolboy Q (his album is dropping this month) * Injury Reserve (going to be releasing their official debut album) * clipping. (they've been allegedly working on a new album) * Isaiah Rashad (his next album should come out this year) There's also Childish Gambino whose next album could be a return to hip hop, considering This is America was a rap track. And plenty of young artists who have yet to put together a great project but have the talent in my opinion to do it, such as Juice WRLD, Lil Uzi Vert, Sheck Wes, Ski Mask the Slump God, and Trippie Redd. For the older guys, I think Logic and J Cole are overrated based on how big their fanbases and the quality of their latest work, but I'll give them mentions, too, since they could always surprise me. So yeah, that's 50 artists I've mentioned either currently producing great hip hop material or showing the potential to do it, and I know I've missed some. And yet, people still try to argue that there's no value in the genre and rap is at its lowest point ever, which couldn't be further from the truth. **Edit:** Haven't listened to them yet, but supposedly **A Quiet Farewell, 2016-2018** by Slauson Malone (blend between sound collage and lo-fi hip hop), **It Wasn't Even Close** by Your Old Droog (jazz rap), and **Cuz I Love You** by Lizzo (pop rap with some R&B and soul elements) are really good. They just came out a few days ago, so feel free to check those out, too!","It's a boom period for sure. There's so much experimentation and variety this decade from new voices, seemingly coming out of nowhere thanks to Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Spotify, AppleMusic, YouTube, etc. The rise in popularity of streaming platforms plays a big role in these artists becoming exposed to a larger audience more easily than ever no doubt.  Hip hop is taking inspiration from so many genres now, up to and including country and 2000s emo. It's an exciting time, the game is red hot right now, I could confidently say that everyone could find at least 1 artist going today that they'll connect with in the genre.  Shout out to r/hiphopheads for being on top of fresh releases and news. I discovered Denzel Curry two years ago from that sub and he's quickly become one of my favourite artists.",139
bgmj8h,"Whenever popular artists release a new track, it seems like the music community will hate on them for being ‚Äúradio friendly‚Äù and ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, but radio tracks are what get stuck in my head and have me listening over and over again.

bgy5wr,"I'm a western, 22 year old woman, and yesterday I was discussing some prog metal albums with my friends, when they said I was ""the only girl they knew who listens to prog"". Then I realized that I'm usually surrounded by long-haired white men whenever I'm at a prog metal concert, and that I'm a bit of an odd one out. In general, I have a pretty broad and undiscriminating taste in music. I listen to some stuff where I'm probably not a part of the main demographic, fx. Bollywood-music, Ethiopian jazz, K-pop, Black metal and Medieval church music. I've always enjoyed exploring new genres, and challenging myself to create a diverse musical library. To me, it is an integral part of developing my musical palette, and being more well-rounded and knowledgeable about music in general. I feel like it helps me be more creative as well. I don't make music, but I draw a lot, and I use music to ""world build"" and imagine landscapes in my head. Varied music helps me explore and push those ideas further. I also highly enjoy researching artists' musical influences -- especially when it turns out they were influenced by music very different form the stuff they make themselves (fx Melvins being influenced by the Lawrence of Arabia soundtrack). But when I asked my prog-friends what else they listen to, they were all somewhat narrow in terms of the genres they liked (metal and indie rock), and they didn't seem interested in exploring unfamiliar genres. The conversation kind of died after that. I was curious if there are some people in this sub who listen to some truly weird shit, or something that might make you stand out in the audience at a live concert, and if so, how does that impact your relationship with music and your creativity? &#x200B; EDIT: People are writing really interesting responses, and I'd encourage you to include examples and recommendations to the things you mention!! I'd love to learn more about reggeaton, boybands and bossa nova, etc","I‚Äôve always believed there‚Äôs something I would like from every genre, whether I have found it yet or not and I enjoy listening to a wide variety of stuff. I‚Äôve always been a huge metal fan (death, black, sludge, etc.) but people are usually confused when they find out I also love a lot of mainstream pop garbage too (huge Taylor Swift fan). I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôm technically in the demographic of many things I listen to, being a white man, but I can‚Äôt say that it influences what I  gravitate towards very much at all.",110
bjkim1,"The Cure‚Äôs [*Disintegration*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6DZNOsLXIU2zOQfQDwDpIS) is turning 30, so let‚Äôs talk about it! &#x200B; **Some background on the album:**  30 years ago, on May 2nd 1989, The Cure released their album *Disintegration*. *Disintegration* marked a return to darker musical landscapes for The Cure after the relatively brighter and more kaleidoscopic *Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me* (87) and *The Head on the Door* (85), harkening back to earlier and darker albums such as *Seventeen Seconds* (80), *Faith* (81) and *Pornography* (82). The return to darker music was deliberate, as frontman Robert Smith believed that he had to create a musical masterpiece before he turned 30 (Smith turned 30 in April 1989) coupled with a desire to move away from the pop success of the two prior albums to create something of more substance.  The album was recorded at Hook End Manor in the winter of 88/89. The recording of the album has a become a bit mythicized through conflicting recounts from various sources, but the general agreement seems to be that there was a fire at some point in or close to Smith‚Äôs room that threatened to destroy the lyrics Smith had written and that the atmosphere during the recording was good with big dinners and the band generally had a good time. As with the *Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me* album, the band worked out from home demos written by the band members. While Smith had decided the musical direction for the album, keyboardist Roger O‚ÄôDonnell has described the album as ‚Äúsuch a band record‚Äù.  It wasn‚Äôt all good times though, as the recording of *Disintegration* ended up in personnel changes. Keyboardist Lol Tolhurst, who had already effectively been replaced by O‚ÄôDonnell, struggled with alcoholism and the band has admitted to very poor treatment and bullying of him. Tolhurst‚Äôs contributions to the recording were close to non-existent and it became clear that Tolhurst no longer had a place in the band and he was fired. Smith has said that he believed that if Tolhurst stayed in the band his alcohol consumption would have killed him or that ‚ÄúSimon \[Gallup\] would have thrown him off a balcony. And then my best friend would be in jail and Lol would be dead. It was much easier for him not to be in the band.‚Äù Tolhurst would later go on to sue the band (and lose), but has since been forgiven and appears to be mostly on friendly terms with most of the band members. Without Tolhurst, who often had acted as a scapegoat, in the band, tensions arose between drummer Boris Williams, bassist Simon Gallup and O‚ÄôDonnell during the tour following the album. This led O‚ÄôDonnell to leave the band at the end of the tour (he would later return to the band (twice)).  As already mentioned *Disintegration* saw The Cure return to creating darker music. The album makes extensive use of keyboards and synthesizers, the Fender VI (six string bass) and long instrumental passages. The majority of the songs have a runtime of over 5 minutes, which reportedly was a consequence of the arrival of the CD that allowed for a longer runtime on a single disc which in turn allowed the band to experiment with atmosphere and longer songs. Upon hearing the album for the first time The Cure‚Äôs labels‚Äô were not happy and their initial reaction was to call it ‚Äúcommercial suicide‚Äù and accusing Smith of being ‚Äúwilfully obscure‚Äù. The record buying public did not agree with the record labels: *Disintegration* would go onto becoming The Cure‚Äôs best selling record and it is often considered to be The Cure‚Äôs magnum opus. The singles from the album were also highly successful as *Disintegration* spawned The Cure‚Äôs most successful singles in both the US and the UK; ‚ÄòLovesong‚Äô and ‚ÄòLullaby‚Äô respectively.  &#x200B; **Basic album facts:** Personnel:  Robert Smith - vocals, guitar, six string bass, keyboards  Simon Gallup - bass, keyboards Porl (now Pearl) Thompson - guitar Boris Williams - drums, percussion  Roger O‚ÄôDonnell - keyboards  Lol Tolhurst - other instrument (it is generally accepted that (pretty much) none of Tolhurst‚Äôs playing made it onto the final record) Lyrics: Smith Music: Smith, Gallup, O‚ÄôDonnell, Thompson, Williams & Tolhurst (it is generally accepted that Tolhurst‚Äôs musical contributions to the album was minimal if any outside of the basis/inspiration for ‚ÄòHomesick‚Äô) Producers: David M.

I‚Äôm not the best at explaining what I think or feel about music, but here is my attempt: I would describe the album as a wintery album and I think the primary colours of the [album cover](https://www.post-punk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/disintegration.jpg), black, greeny-blues and reddish-purple, are very representative of the album as a whole. To me, listening to the album feels like being smothered (in a nice way) in a comforting blanket. Some of my favourite aspects of *Disintegration* are the atmosphere the album creates as well as the breathing room in the songs. I think there is breathing room both in terms of composition - the songs are allowed to breathe and grow organically as they are not rushed to reach an end - and production - despite being a relatively dense album in terms of layers of instrumentation, I never feel like the layers cancel each other out or become too busy/superfluous and it feels like you can ‚Äòwalk between them‚Äô if that makes sense. The use of the Fender VI is also something I appreciate as I adore the sound of it and I think it fits well on the album. I also love the melodic and driving basslines on the album. Lyrically, I think *Disintegration* is one of best, it not the best, of Smith‚Äôs work.  To sum it up: to me, listening to *Disintegration* feels like walking outside in a quiet winter night while it is snowing and I love it! &#x200B; I‚Äôd love to hear others‚Äô thoughts on the album, whether they are on the music itself, personal experiences connected to the album, the album‚Äôs place in music history or anything else you want to share related to the album.","It's wild to me how synonymous the Fender Bass VI is with Robert Smith. For those who don't know, the Bass VI isn't exactly a six-string bass guitar as is more widely produced (i.e. a bass with an extra low string and extra high string) but rather something in between a bass and 6-string guitar. The strings are heavier than a baritone guitar's but way thinner than a bass's.  One of *the* defining features of the era post-punk that the Cure define, for me, is the use of basslines that carry the bulk of the melody, leaving guitars free to sculpt the washes of ambiance that are all over *Disintegration*, and would come to full fruition during the shoegaze scene. With the sheer density of guitars and synths on some of these tracks, none of the songs on this record could have been as fully realized without Smith's articulate use of the Bass VI's mid-range punch. What makes this album such a special listen for me time and time again is that each composition seems to exist in a three-dimensional space. It's like a cathedral or a massive machine; the atmospheric architecture is vast and unfathomable, but the bass frequencies chug along like the gears beneath the floorboards, keeping you grounded. Meanwhile on songs like ""Lullaby"" there's an intimate quality to the vocals (up front in the mix, not too much reverb, etc.). It's as though, in the midst of all these wide-open, vaulted spaces and intricately orbiting machines, someone is there, just over your shoulder, whispering in your ear like a confessor or a lover. It really is an incredible achievement for rock music, in my opinion, and deserves virtually all of the praise slavishly lavished on by critics.",64
bs0ap7,"Hey yall. Let's take a breather from *""I think this band is underrated""* threads and talk about songs that came to light in interesting ways. I'll begin with a fantastic threeway from way back in time. Let's set the mood:      The year is 1965, the world is in a political hysteria and the papers are writing about the horrific events going down in Vietnam. A 17 year old France Gall is about to enter the stage of the biggest event of the entire year; Eurovision Song Contest. With millions of eyes fixed on her she engages in the everso dramatic ***[Poupee De Cire, Poupee De Son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5aeeSmkPwQ)***, written by Serge Gainsburg. Of course it won, and it goes down as one of the greatest hits of the entire show history.      However it doesn't do as well with her Fianc√©e, who couldn't and wouldn't allow her, a puny 17 year old girl, to be more famous than he is. This dude was *Claude Antoine Marie Fran√ßois*, who was not nearly as flamboyant as his name attests to. He got furious, so he dumped her and wrote a song so good no one would remember France Gall's Eurovision one-hit wonder! What he wound up with was ***[Comme d'habitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GME3fMeK5ts)*** and right now you all are like ""well fuck"". And you're right. Fuck. Needless to say the song was a fucking wrecking ball of a hit.      Across the big pond none other than Sinatra was like ""yo I need that one"", so he hired this new young songwriter to rewrite *Comme d'habitude* for him, so the young songwriter named David did. Frank hated his version, so he fired David and hired Paul Anka instead, who rewrote the song and created ***[My Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onWf4_yl-pY)***, which you probably could have guessed by now.      So that's about it, isn't it? What happened to young David, you say? Oh yeah he decided to record the song himself, but he completely changed the lyrics. ***[This is what his version sounds like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZKcl4-tcuo)***","[**When the Levee Breaks by Led Zeppelin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwiTs60VoTM) was originally recorded in 1928 by [**Memphis Minnee McCoy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c97VqLGXLXw) who is given ***co-writing*** credits on the Zeppelin album, even though the song is really all hers. The production was delayed when John Bonham couldn't get the booming sound he was looking for in the studio.  Eventually, his drums were recorded in a stairwell with  the microphones planted 3 stories up. The drum sound echoed skyward and  was captured on the mics, creating a [**very innovative and distinctive  sound.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSAiba3VEs4)",43
byim9a,"Edit: Thanks for all the answers! I found more examples of what I'm looking for. Do any of you have examples of songs that turned against their creators? I'm looking for examples of artists who got it worse off because of one song. Here's an example of what I'm looking for: I recently came across a story of Eagle's guitarist Don Felder, about his song Hotel California. He composed the song demo with multiple guitars and multiple takes, but he had a problem playing it live: he had to switch from a 12-strings guitar for the intro, to an electric guitar for the solo. To make it easier, he got a 20 lbs. double neck guitar. The song got so famous that he had to play it a _lot_, which caused him back pain problems over the years. More examples: there's also the case of songs that inspired horrific things (_Helter Skelter_ and Charles Manson), songs that were caught in personal crossfire (Neil Young's _Hey Hey, My My_ was quoted in Kurt Cobain's suicide note). I'm also looking for songs where the author admits to something, and it comes back to bite them (murders? crimes?). It seems like the most common occurence of songs turning against their artists is when they became way more famous than the rest of the artists work‚Ä¶ I guess it's bad, but it's still good for the artist.","These two come to mind for me. Both are political, sorry in advanced. Our very stable genius of a president at one time threatened to sue the now deceased Mac Miller because Mac had a successful track about Donald‚Äôs alleged success and playboy-public image. Mac ended up resenting the track, one of his early singles that helped catapult him to fame,  because it became an anthem for Trump supporters during the run up to 2016. Paul Ryan once said his favorite band was Rage Against the Machine, to which Tom Morello explained that Ryan was literally the embodiment of the machine that they spent their careers raging against.",217
bzbcvr,"***https://radiohead.bandcamp.com*** So Thom Yorke was hacked. The hacker found his private collection of their unreleased music created between 1995-1998. The hacker demanded a sum of $150,000, otherwise he'd release the music for the public.

There is a *lot* too so any highlights (say an extended early version of Paranoid Android + studio jam) can be followed by hours of not a lot. But worth checking out what appears to be a definitive version of Lift on disc 15, that really should have been on the album.  There has been considerable interest and I bet a good few people will pay ¬£18 even if it is uncurated and patchy. I wonder what the future could be for this kind of thing - Radiohead may be more precious about their art and only released this once hacked, but bands may realise they can put out hours of studio noodling for a similar figure and have their fanbase salivate over it.",131
c6wvre,[Link] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.youredm.com/2019/06/26/artists-lost-tapes-umg-fire/amp/) This article reveals a huge list of artists who lost their master recordings back in 2008 due to a structure fire at UMG. Most of these artists are just now finding out. It‚Äôs difficult to comprehend the damage done here and how devastating this is to music history. There‚Äôs likely those who have no backups and have lost their original recordings forever. What are your thoughts on the matter? Especially from anyone affected by this.,"If you don‚Äôt have at least three back-ups, one of which is off-site, you don‚Äôt have any back-ups.",74
c86zsm,"Honestly, album covers matter more to me than I would like to say. Sometimes I will look over certain albums if the album art is generic or uninteresting. I mean, there are obvious exceptions, but there have definitely been cases where I ignore certain albums that I later found to really enjoy because either the title or the album art was lackluster.","Some album arts do a good job of speaking to the content of the album. Some are just nice to look at. Often I've listened to albums just based off of their album art (or having a good band name, but that's a parallel discussion). Uh, yeah. So yes I do think it's important. *However*, I can look past bad art if I'm already invested in the band/songs on the album. I don't know that bad album art has ever put me off listening to anyone. I think by the time I see the art I've already decided whether I'm giving it a shot or not, either by hearing songs from it or having it recommended (ignoring bands I'm already familiar with and would listen to regardless).",95
cdpazr,"Probably going to be under a majority. In my opinion, it the whole album isn‚Äôt a perfect flow, it‚Äôs not worth my time.  I‚Äôm never in 2 moods at the same time, either. Most albums I have saved are very consistent with their theme and therefore make for a more pleasurable experience overall, for me. It‚Äôs also fun to know the track list, and also appreciate how the artist wanted the logical flow of the album to play out.  Say you like *Karma Police* for Radiohead‚Äôs OK Computer. Does that song really do the whole album justice, if you only care about that song?  Oh yeah, and I also enjoy artists where I like A LOT of their discography. So I can do research and consider buying their physical releases and whatnot. Is anyone else like me, playlist-free?","I‚Äôm fully with you in that my favourite listening experiences are full albums where all the songs flow together perfectly.  Unfortunately, a lot of musicians nowadays release singles only, or release albums of songs that are good individually but don‚Äôt necessarily flow together. There‚Äôs definitely still a lot of great albums, but listening solely to albums nowadays would cut a listener off to a lot of good music. Another defense of playlists is when I want to listen to songs of a certain mood. A lot of albums include all different kinds of songs, and if I‚Äôm looking specifically for energetic, sad, psychedelic, etc songs, a full album often won‚Äôt be what I want. I take a lot of joy from piecing together different songs from different artists and making a whole new collection of music with it‚Äôs own overall feel.  So no, I‚Äôm not playlist free, but I‚Äôll be damned if I don‚Äôt absolutely love a full album that‚Äôs been lovingly designed by a great artist.",93

cec1ya,"I used to be a big fan of Pitchfork. So one of my favorite things to do now, naturally, is discuss how and why they have come to be so much worse at what they do. I realize this is a heated topic in the music subreddits so, just for fun, I decided to write a whole blog post on the idea. You can read that [here](https://jawnluca.com/how-pitchfork-lost-its-point-1b8d579f0c95) (excuse the plug). I will also copy and paste it below for those that don't want to open up a new tab :)  &#x200B; Really curious what everyone thinks and especially curious about people who outright disagree that their influence has waned at all or think they are doing just fine at what they do.  &#x200B; **TL;DR** P4K has lot all its bite. Their decline is from an unwillingness to be the bad guy and go against the grain of popular culture, especially when it comes to rating rap albums from popular artists. They are okay bashing contentious figures like XXX, 6ix 9ine, and other social pariahs, but unwilling to take down other artists with better social standing. Just look at their scores on [AOTY.org](https://AOTY.org).  &#x200B; **Full read:** # [How Pitchfork lost its point](https://jawnluca.com/how-pitchfork-lost-its-point-1b8d579f0c95) [ ](https://jawnluca.com/@GianlucaPezzuti)In his excellent book Let‚Äôs Talk about Love: A Journey to the End of Taste, Carl Wilson says, ‚ÄúCool things eventually become uncool.‚Äù This idea is an axiom as true and observed as the laws of thermodynamics. Coolness as social capital is fleeting and all things that climb to the peak of the coolness bell curve must eventually descend. And so I say: Pitchfork is kinda lame now. The internet would argue that I‚Äôm very late to the party. I‚Äôm hardly the first person to say this and, in fact, you could argue this gripe is played out. Every year, without fail, music fans declare the death of two things: rock music and *Pitchfork*. Neither statement is completely true or false. Rock is still kickin‚Äô, just not in the limelight. And I don‚Äôt think Pitchfork is dead, just old. The latter is something I struggle with personally, like watching my once superhero dad use Yahoo as a search engine. He can‚Äôt help it. He‚Äôs old. And *Pitchfork* can‚Äôt help it either. They are gently and graciously aging, following the arc of all music publications before them. **Stage 1**: Edgy, disruptive fringe publication ‚Üí **Stage 2**: Influential authority, tastemaker ‚Üí **Stage 3**: Lumbering dad-rag I want to explore what happened to the site I used to love so much. # What is a music critic‚Äôs job? The answer to this question has changed over time. Decades ago, when people bought and paid for albums, consumers relied on critics to help them spend their money wisely. Outside of the radio, MTV, or a friend whose music taste you trusted, there were few ways to experience a release before buying it ([here is a fun write up on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/734guh/redditor_explains_why_pitchfork_sucks_so_bad/dnnsr3j)). So in this capacity, the critic‚Äôs allegiance is to the consumer. But with the advent of music streaming services like Youtube and Spotify, critics ‚Äî in this role ‚Äî are obsolete. Listeners can go direct to the source and decide for themselves if they like a piece of music. People can pass judgement on a new album faster than they can read a review, and Spotify has an algorithm that will create playlists for you based on your unique tastes. But that‚Äôs not really a problem for Pitchfork. Their heyday, the late 2000s, was rife with file sharing and it was entirely possible to listen to music without paying for it. I‚Äôd argue what made *Pitchfork* cool was their ability lift up or crush bands with a single scored review. They were tastemakers. Pitchfork became ‚Äúthe most trusted voice in music‚Äù by predicting, or even driving, the success of bands like Arcade Fire and Bon Iver. But I believe, more important than championing new acts ‚Äî something Pitchfork hasn‚Äôt stopped doing ‚Äî is their seeming unwillingness to be the bad guy. # Tastechaser Pitchfork is just as famous for their pans as they are for their extravagant, gushing reviews. They infamously destroyed the careers of indie darlings like [Jet ](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9464-shine-on/)and The Dismemberment Plan‚Äôs [Travis Morrison](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5607-travistan/). The lesson isn‚Äôt that Pitchfork should be mean again, but they seem to have forgotten how to go against the grain. They‚Äôve become wave riders, not makers. The best example of this is Ian Cohen‚Äôs review of *Camp* by Childish Gambino. Cohen gave the album a 1.6. He didn‚Äôt just shred it, he articulated why it deserved that 1.6 and what it could have done better. At the time, this was a pretty ballsy move. [Look at how other publications scored *Camp*](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/2957-childish-gambino-camp.php) (pay attention to the reviews from the same year of release, anybody can review in hindsight). When other publications praised, Pitchfork booed ‚Äî and they were right. *Camp*may have been popular upon release, but it is now remembered as problematic in many different ways. Here are [some of the artists Pitchfork panned hardest in 2018](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/ratings/worst/2018/1): Greta van Fleet, 6ix 9ine, Sun Kil Moon, XXXTentacion. A Led Zeppelin cover band, a sex offender, a rival, and an abuser. Easy targets. Maybe next year they‚Äôll take on book reviews and pan *Mein Kampf*. Pitchfork appear to be afraid to say no, especially when it comes to hip hop. I refuse to believe this stems from an inability to discern good from bad. The narrative that the writers and editors at Pitchfork are inept is lazy. They know their stuff, and yet appear unusually toothlessness when it comes to passing judgement on music not made by social pariahs. Let‚Äôs use last year‚Äôs *Drip Harder* by Gunna and Lil Baby as an example. Pitchfork gave it a 7.6. It was a terrible album made by two popular rappers. This is where things get tricky. Music criticism is protected by the buffer of art subjectivity. It is impossible to have a conversation about what Pitchfork should and shouldn‚Äôt be panning without someone saying, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just your opinion.‚Äù Of course music reviews are subjective, but reviewers are supposed to know better, with expertise and perspective gained from years of diverse listening. *Drip Harder* is offensively lazy. It is the fast fashion of hip hop, pure trend over style. It sounded like every other album in 2018 and will not be remembered in five years. If their biggest gripe with Greta van Fleet is their blatant mimicry of another artist‚Äô sound, then Lil Baby and Gunna are guilty 100 times over for imitating Young Thug and ruminating the same lyrical platitudes over the same exhausted beats. I‚Äôd go so far as to argue that Pitchfork has a duty to pan. Who knows what would have happened had they given Gunna and Lil Baby a 1.6. Maybe nothing. Or maybe the remaining clout Pitchfork has would have woken them up a bit. These are two of the industry‚Äôs most promising up and coming rappers. Maybe a bad review would make them better. While Donald Glover had some issues with Ian Cohen‚Äôs take on certain parts of the infamous *Camp* review, [he also agreed with some of it](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rqexvr/donald-glover-childish-gambino-interview). It shaped him and possibly encouraged him to improve. If Pitchfork is the most trusted voice in music, then they aren‚Äôt doing us, or Gunna and Lil Baby for that matter, any favors by doling out passing grades for bad music. For a music publication that obsesses over being on the right side of history, with their retroactive reviews of past albums, you‚Äôd think they take a stance on mediocre ones in the present. Do not misunderstand me. The men and women who work at Pitchfork are good at what they do. Their office isn‚Äôt full of mustache twirling suits who just don‚Äôt get music. These are talented writers and authorities on what sounds good. Pitchfork is happy to laud rap albums that are fresh and interesting and new. So why are they afraid to take a stance on bad rap music by beloved artists the way they did for indie music? # The death of cool Pitchfork is old. The site has been around for roughly 25 years. In the internet age that is an eternity. The older we get, the softer we become, the less cool we are. We get jobs that aren‚Äôt exactly what we had imagined for us. We compromise. Pitchfork grew up because they had to. They‚Äôre making money, the writers have unionized (which is great), and they are able to run two full blown festivals in Paris and Chicago. That‚Äôs awesome. The cost, unfortunately, is that Pitchfork will never be a tastemaker again. There is no money to be made in tastemaking. Digging up the next big thing doesn‚Äôt translate into clicks. Hence the TMZ-esque articles on the front page of the site, or worse, [this Amazon affiliate backlinking monstrosity](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-best-gear-to-take-to-music-festivals/). Superb hip hop writer [Jeff Weiss says it better](https://theoutline.com/post/5129/passion-of-the-weiss-patreon-interview). There‚Äôs nothing wrong with growing up and cashing in, but music criticism requires you stay young at heart. Because whether the next generation is right or wrong about what‚Äôs good, they are always prophetic. It‚Äôs the music critics job to approach listening to new music with the scope and perspective of age and the curiosity and playfulness of youth. That‚Äôs what makes for good criticism. Pitchfork are afraid to rock the boat: Bad grades are reserved for bad people. Don‚Äôt take down anyone the kids might like, for fear of looking out of touch. I think of Pitchfork as a little brother. One desperately avoiding the pitfalls of his older siblings ‚Äî in this case Rolling Stone and NME ‚Äî who bitterly refused to change with the times and paid for it. Pitchfork learned from them and appropriately began to champion hip hop and embrace poptimism. But maybe they course corrected too far. In effort to stay relevant they‚Äôve become gutless. Cool things become uncool by forgetting what made them cool in the first place. Pitchfork aren‚Äôt necessarily worse than before. They don‚Äôt suck. Hell, the writers are even better now. They just aren‚Äôt the same site we fell in love with.",I'll never pass up a chance to reiterate how embarrassing p4k's coddling of mainstream rappers is. It's so blatant that it's just funny now.,94
cg17n1,"Recently I've been thinking about how some genres seem to peak and immediately reach a dead end when the quality of musicianship goes to high. For example, whatever you would call what Joe Santriani and Steve Vai does, it reached a limit at some point (the early 90s?) and there wasn't any where else to go with it and the progression of that genre just stopped. For me, the perfect example of this is turntablism. It felt really exciting in the late 90s and early 00s, but as time wore on it started to feel like *just* a series of tricks without any context, kind of like an Olympics gymnastics routine. Unless you knew what was happening it was just an hour or two of irritating high pitched zap sounds and two second drum breaks from records you didn't know. It was a genre that was pretty hard to fall out of love with and now I don't listen to any of the *Shiggar Fraggar* CDs I have - what's the point? What are your thoughts? What other genres screwed themselves by leaning too hard into musicianship? Math rock? Free jazz?","it's just generally a musician problem. It's the Steely Dan-effect, as my dad calls it. It's what occours when a musician is so comfortable with their craft and with themselves, so that they no longer need the validation of the audience and as such begin making music soley for themselves. It also generates a snowball effect, since the next musicians have to overdo previous generations is virtuosity.  This is obviously not necessarily a qualitative statement, as a lot of great music has come out of this. &#x200B; But even more good music has come out as a counter to this, including punk and black metal.",142
citsq3,"Hi folks, I've just been reading [this review](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cat-power-moon-pix/) of Cat Power's Moon Pix published in the sunday review series on pitchfork, and having never heard the record before I'm on the cusp of checking it out. I have been reading up on the back story, about how Chan Marshall had this feverish hallucinatory nightmare before waking up and demoing the album in its entirety, convinced she was going to die, and have been entirely captivated by the story.  The review also mentions Slint's Spiderland, and upon this comparison I immediately understood the gravity of what Chan experienced - apparently, one of the members of Slint checked himself into a psychiatric hospital immediately after tracking the vocals for the closing track on that album. I've loved Spiderland for many years, and the final 60 seconds of that record are utterly chilling when you know this information. To think Cat Power was tapping into that kind of surreal experience caught my attention right away. (Edit: upon request I removed the timestamp because y'all need to hear the [whole thing](https://youtu.be/FAApF-FDkoY)!) So, my idea for the discussion - I want to know about more albums like this. I want to talk about any records you know of where something strange or weird happened during the creation process. This Cat Power review has rekindled in me a certain fascination with these kinds of cryptic hints - bonus points for cases where you can pretty much hear it on record.   I'll give some examples: - [This Mars Volta story](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18513345) about a Ouija Board and a studio flood  - [that scream](https://www.liveabout.com/the-love-rollercoaster-scream-3299657) on love rollercoaster - [Loveless](https://youtu.be/fmhfN386Skw) (nearly bankrupted the label and sent Kevin Shields down the rabbit hole for 23 more years)  - [Deerhunter - Cryptograms](https://youtu.be/lDJ79oMGbAI) (first sessions supposedly failed due to faulty gear and bradford being fairly unwell, second session yielded completely different music, the band went on to release both batches in an utterly interesting combined document where the first half eerily cuts off as the tape spins off the reel)  - [Fun house by the stooges](https://youtu.be/1OedEgzDl_I) (I don't know anything about the recording process here but hearing that record alone is terrifying) - Edit: honourable mention goes to [this king gizzard song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylzxhb7jOJg) which is apparently a true story about how Ambrose was accidentally glassed in the neck in a pretend fight and came awfully close to dying from blood loss. I hope I'm in the right place for this - hit me with your best creepy back stories!","Wilco‚Äôs *A Ghost is Born* was recorded with bandleader Jeff Tweedy suffering from severe depression, anxiety, and having to deal with intense migraines. He ended up developing an addiction to painkillers because he couldn‚Äôt function without them, and checked himself into rehab a few weeks before the album was supposed to be released.  The album itself is insane and I wanna write more about it. It‚Äôs basically this beautiful and luscious folk pop album with screeching noise rock guitar, and they work together incredibly well. The noise keeps adding up into the album until it culminated in Less Than You Think, a beautiful little ballad that very suddenly shifts into a 13 minute drone song.  It‚Äôs an album that perfectly encapsulates how it feels to suffer from a depressive episode, of a panic attack. There are a few hints scattered around the album on what‚Äôs to come, but you never really notice them until Less than you Think hits you. It‚Äôs a gripping, amazing song, and it‚Äôs so intense it makes the finale of the album, this cute little pop ditty that plays immediately after, sound like a gift from heaven. It‚Äôs a very positive end to a very depressing album, and I think it‚Äôs a tragic and eerie masterpiece.",130
cokddh,"That first album is a classic. Groovy drums, chuncky bass, haunting vocals and guitars sounding like they where mixed by DJ's. No one had ever produced something like this before. The twisted sound of 'shoots and ladders', the excitement you get while hearing 'Blind' and the emptiness you feel after hearing 'Daddy' make this album a masterpiece for me. Imo they should've stopped producing after 'Issues'. They hit the mainstream, played Woodstock...I think that would've been the best for them and Nu Metal as a whole. While 'Untouchables' was ok, Korn doesn't even sound like Korn anymore. But this band deserves a 'thanks for existing' award in my book.","I always try to say this but the metal elitists start getting on my ass. I'm someone who listens to all kinds of metal, ranging from thrash to death to stoner, and I still fucking love Korn. Their first album especially was incredibly influential to what was about to come, even tho people hate most of that genre.",89
d2wwxg,"RIP to a man who, in my opinion, is of the greatest and most genuine musicians of all time. I just wanted to start a thread to talk with other fans and share some of our favorite songs or maybe covers you did and to just talk about how his music affected you. Personally I'm really broken up right now. Daniel's music has gotten me through very tough times in my life and still does, his emotional honesty always cut into me and made me feel less lonely in those dark times. Here's one of my favorite tunes from him, [Peek a Boo](https://youtu.be/tOL9h6tz5jM). Rest easy Daniel, you will be missed.","Walking the Cow has to be my favorite. It‚Äôs so sincere, simple, and melancholy. From the beginning with the little farm noises, to the final chord, I‚Äôve never had a song so simple hit me with such force. I probably tear up every time I listen to it. I haven‚Äôt completely figured out the meaning of the lyrics, all I know is the sole inspiration was Daniel looking at an ice cream container.  For me it‚Äôs one of those songs that can be listened to in most situations, where you can kind of project your current experiences/emotions into it. Probably why it consistently feels so personal, this song always seems to resonate with whatever I‚Äôm going through, good or bad, alone or with others.  A lot of Daniel‚Äôs music is that way I find. There‚Äôs a childlike charm to it all, from his playful voice, to the fact that you can literally HEAR him pressing the keys of his chord organ in a lot of songs. Lyrically it‚Äôs also very playful, though often with an underlying sadness or anxiousness (though sometimes none at all!).  He‚Äôs a lo-fi legend, and one of the greatest lyricists of all time. Able to convey so much emotion with so little tools. He will be sorely missed.",67
d5b5na,"I turned on Jeff the other day and it hit me in such a raw emotional way. His silky smooth voice and range tore right through me as I sat helplessly on the couch. Watching videos of numerous musicians such as Jimmy Page, Thom Yorke, Chris Cornell, etc talk so highly of Jeff Buckley and it makes me sad to the point of being sick. Grace is one of the finest albums of the 90s and he was destined to be up there with the greats. The first time I read about his death by drowning which involved no foul play or drugs, my stomach dropped. Rip Jeff.",Once upon a time I got an autographed camel cigarette package from him (was all I had on me) telling me that smoking would kill me.  He was gone in less than a year.,115
d7evbd,"There‚Äôs been a lot of really boring, lazy post in the sub recently so they decided to try and shake things up with a conversation starter. A year or so ago, I was deep into Parliament Funkadelic and George Clinton. I‚Äôd fallen deeply in love with their catalogue and wanted to find people that agreed with me on it. So naturally, considering I don‚Äôt have any music nerd friends in real life, I searched for validation online. And in doing so came across an old Pitchfork review of a Parliament Funkadelic album, I can‚Äôt remember which one.  But the writer, I believe her name is Dominique Leone, made a point which has stuck with me for quite a while now. She said it‚Äôs a great example of racism, and bias towards white bands, that Parliament is only known as a funk group among critics and the general public. If they‚Äôre even discussed at all. She said that Parliament had everything Led Zeppelin had. Great guitar solos, mind melting psychedelia, insane production, drugs, sex, fantastic vocalists, in short, everything that we give credit to Led Zeppelin for in the ‚Äúarchetype ‚Äú of a great, debauched rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll band. And being on this site, which is populated mostly by white middle-class men, there is a distinct bias towards white middle-class rock. And I‚Äôm not trying to shame people for not knowing something or for liking the music they like but it is a little ridiculous that there‚Äôs a subreddit with thousand of users for a band like the Red Hot Chili Peppers which would not exist without Parliament yet there‚Äôs almost no discussion of that very same group that so profoundly influenced them. I mean Funkadelic and Parliament were not only insanely influential in their own time but they continue to have a legacy and profound effect on popular culture today. Look at the billboard charts today. Most of the groups on there are hip-hop tax or pop.  How did that happen?  Well I think you could arguably say that raps first big ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù moment on the charts came through Dr. Dre and The Chronic, and later Snoop Dogg‚Äôs Doggystyle, both of which are *indebted* to the George Clinton samples that helped make G-Funk. Without those incredible songs to sample off and remake, you never would‚Äôve had an album made by two black guys in Compton California falling into the hands of suburban white teenagers. And in a roundabout way it wouldn‚Äôt have paved the road to make the dominance hip-hop is experiencing right now on the charts possible.  Is Led Zeppelin still influential? Of course, but it‚Äôs disciples are relegated to the rock charts. It‚Äôs influence isn‚Äôt nearly as far reaching on today‚Äôs popular music as Parliament‚Äôs is. But let‚Äôs forget about the Zepplin for a second. Let‚Äôs take another, arguably, the biggest ‚Äúpsychedelic ‚Äúrock group of the 21st-century, Tame Impala. Kevin Parker is a musical genius. He has some insane skills across-the-board when it comes to production, vocals, and instruments. But I would argue that Tame Impala is not doing anything now that Parliament Funkadelic didn‚Äôt do 40 years ago, and weirder! Listen to a track like Free Your Mind And Your Ass Will Follow. Listen to Eulogy and Light. That‚Äôs not Funk. That‚Äôs some Pink Floyd DSOTM shit....except three fucking years before it. before it even came out. Kevin Parker wishes he could make something is fucking insane is those songs sound. If that‚Äôs not psychedelic I don‚Äôt know what the fuck it is. Yet how many people talk about that song or the band in general, in the same category as other psychedelic...cough* white cough*.... bands? It‚Äôs rather annoying.  It‚Äôs a travesty to me, and proof of why it doesn‚Äôt matter, that Led Zeppelin was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame not long after its creation while Parliament had to wait decades before they got their dues.  I love funk. I think it‚Äôs one of the greatest musical genres ever. But it‚Äôs unfair for us to pigeonhole Parliament into that when they were. so much more. And if you consider yourself music fan take the extra step, don‚Äôt be lazy, and dive deeper into its history. It‚Äôs easy to regurgitate the same tired points about a band that‚Äôs been talked about to death. Led Zeppelin was an amazing band. Their legacy is solidified.  Let‚Äôs try and appreciate the groups that got pushed to the side due to the racism of the times. Let‚Äôs talk more about Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Parliament, Funkadelic, Earth, Wind, and Fire, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, amazing bands that need to be inside the minds of today‚Äôs youth other than their most notable hits.","I totally agree that race has played a huge and unfair role in how they're viewed, but they're  a bit inaccessible for other reasons too. If you're not into funk (I appreciate it, but it's just not what I like to listen to), they do play a lot of funk. The two bands fusing into one thing is confusing - it's hard to know where to start. And for a rock guy (hand up!) the song you're most likely to hear and love, Maggot Brain, doesn't seem to be a gateway to their other stuff.    Maybe I'm just making excuses. Anyway you've definitely convinced me to go listen to them more, thank you!",121
d9rwwt,"I stream most of my music, and one of the things that drive me crazy is seeing both the ""standard"" and ""fancy"" versions of records. Also seeing ""(remastered)"" after every song title drives me insane. I would much more prefer the streaming version of albums to just have the normal album name & song title without the fancy naming. Thoughts? Edit: I love all the bonus content and such. I just wish it was just added to the normal album, and not warrant a separate one","I hate not having control over song and artist naming conventions on streaming services period.

Motherfucking mildew goddamn it! I guess I listen to a lot of reissue, repackaged stuff so I'm the target audience.

The list doesn't include any post ""Flower Boy"" Tyler the Creator songs which I think is odd No Childish Gambino or Janelle Monae No Sufjan Stevens No Run the Jewels No Billie Eilish or Lizzo No Weyes Blood No Lil Nas X (Yes I know his songs might be corny but you can't deny that ""Old Town Road"" was huge) I'm kind of disappointed.","Pitchfork's conversion to full on poptimism is complete, and there is basically nothing left of the indie scene(s) that defined them.

dgbdn6,"recently the podcast ‚ÄúYour Favorite Band Sucks‚Äù was recommended to me on Spotify and i became sorta obsessed with it. for those who don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs a podcast dedicated to tearing down fan-favorite bands, e.g. The Beatles, Red Hot Chili Peppers, REM, the Strokes, Radiohead, etc. at first i had fun listening to these guys rip into critically beloved acts without mercy. there‚Äôs something satisfying about their no-exception savagery.  but the more i listen to the podcast, the more i realize how one note their takedowns are. every podcast, they point out a few things without fail: the band rips off another band, the band sold out, the band is writing it‚Äôs music for mass audiences, ad nausuem. they constantly point out the so-called hypocrisy of fans who claim they love this band authentically, but claim this love is naive, stupid or inauthentic. at a point, whether they were ripping into a band i like (radiohead) or one i personally find overrated (REM), i began to find the podcast really annoying. who gives a fuck about being ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù or whether you‚Äôve sold out? as a young millennial/ gen z-er, i find that more often than not people couldn‚Äôt care less about whether the music they like is authentic or not. look at current trends in music, where poptimism reigns and PC music stars like Charlie XCX and Sophie are writing awesome music based on subverting classic pop formats. this music totally destroys the idea of ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù experience with music.  in the most recent episode, on the shins, the guys spend a lot of time talking about the na√Øvet√© of a band ‚Äúchanging your life.‚Äù almost verbatim, they say something like: ‚Äúmusic, culture, it‚Äôs all a pyramid scheme. you like what tastemakers tell you to like.‚Äù i know it‚Äôs kind of tongue in cheek, and it‚Äôs responding to indie journalism trends of the 2000s, but it has the completely wrong message. maybe a website told me Ok Computer was the best album of the 90s, but i create any meaning i derive from that record, not the tastemaker. the form of criticism that YFBS partakes in disempowers the listener and calls audiences stupid. it‚Äôs practically the same thing that major labels and journals do when they tell you what to like. why fall into the same cynical patter when you could be calling attention to good creative work? the whole reminds me of the do-nothing slacker culture of the 90s, where cynicism reigned over all.  has anyone else listened to this podcast? what‚Äôs your opinion of it? i‚Äôve ultimately concluded that i find the whole thing rather distasteful, but i‚Äôd be open to hear other opinions.","There's something about people tearing the shit out of something for 45 minutes straight without a single dissenting voice in the room that's just... trashy.  I just listened to about 5 minutes of the Oasis episode and it reminds me of those YouTube videos where someone will go through a speech made by a politician and pause it every 5 Seconds to offer their rebuttals. As if that's a difficult or interesting thing to do at all. Stuff that's lowbrow, trashy and negative usually makes me laugh if it's good. When that takes the form of listening to people who think they are too cool for everything, it just makes me wonder what it is they're trying to prove. It might be satire but that doesn't make it funny. Bitterness is never funny. Those are my first impressions anyway, it might not be an entirely fair assessment Edit last sentence due to autocorrect",282
dhrk10,"Playlists are more ubiquitous than ever due to the rise of streaming apps. Playlists democratize music curation by making playlist creation accessible to everyone. But it seems nobody is using playlists as a means of artistic expression. Much like albums prior to the idea of a concept album, playlists are only used as a convenient packaging tool rather than as an expressive medium.  I would love to see album-like playlists which tightly controlled composition and length (15 min - 1 hr). I think a good name for these would be **micro-playlists**. These playlists should affect a strong message or emotion to the listener, much like a well-crafted album. The possibilities of this medium are endless and I would love to see a community form around building and sharing micro-playlists. Here are some examples of what micro-playlist categories might look like: * **Artist Evolution**: Demonstrate the development and maturation of an artist (Kendrick Lamar: Ignorance Is Bliss --> Rigamortus --> m.A.A.d City --> Alright --> LOVE.). * **Hyperfocused theme**: Curate a set of songs which have almost identical instruments, emotions, themes, and aesthetics (Kasey Musgraves: Golden Hour --> Snail Mail: Let's Find An Out --> Soccer Mommy: Clean --> Julien Baker: Turn Out The Lights), in order to evoke a strong response or impart a specific emotion. * **Curator's Personal Statement**: Tracks are reordered, substituted, added, or removed over a long time horizon as the curator's preferences and tastes change. * **Genre Transformation**: Start from genre A and slowly introduce elements of genre B while phasing out genre A. Or, a genre starter pack with only a small amount of the most accessible tracks.","i guess that you're not old enough to remember mix tapes? Those were generally 35-60 minutes long, sometimes 90 and were almost always well thought out and curated. all that's old is new again... https://mashable.com/2009/02/09/music-playlist/",185
dit2l4,"I was re-listening to Eminem's Marshall Mathers LP when I came across [""Kim""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3olE6bHjBw). In this song, Eminem discovers ""evidence"" of cheating and enters into a psychotic state, where he kidnaps, tortures, and eventually murders Kim, the mother of his child. What makes this different from all the other times he talks about killing is the realism. While in other songs, such as Bonnie and Clyde '99, the killing is alluded to but not explicitly depicted. In ""Stan"", the murder happens during the song but the character is fictional. In ""Kim"", not only is it a chillingly accurate and believable portrayal of how this could go in real life when a hysterical and homicidal husband finds his wife has been cheating on him (and kills the other man and his kid), but Kim is not only a real person, but the real mother of his child - a child who will eventually grow up to hear this song.  All of this is fine, right? Art is art, and I think most of us have a radical take on what should be acceptable content in this form of expression. However, consider this: >In July 2000, during the ""Up in Smoke Tour"", Kim and her sister attended Eminem's concert, during which he played the song ""Kim"" (though he had earlier told her he wouldn't). During the performance, Eminem produced a blow-up doll and proceeded to attack it violently before throwing it into the crowd. Kim left the show after witness this and got into a car accident on the way back. Once she reached home, she attempted to commit suicide by slitting her wrists. In my head, this song crosses a clear ethical boundary, to the point where I would consider it to be a form of emotional abuse. It's targeting a seemingly nonconsenting individual and an innocent child whose lives will be forever changed because of the content of the song. Many people have the unfortunate experience of being traumatized by witnessing domestic abuse as a child- imagine if it was immortalized in song for the world to hear. Yet I wouldn't consider, say, a riot starting from a Rage Against The Machine song to be unethical, even if someone gets hurt or killed. What do you think?","Sure. Plagiarism, for example, can make the production of a song inherently unethical. But I'll go a step further in that and cite Blue Sky Black Death / Jean Grae's Evil Jeanius. It's a real killer of an album, honestly one of my favorite rap albums of all time. Part of what sells it is Jean's hard-hitting, self-affirming lyricism. Problem - although she recorded the vocals, she never authorized their final use in the album, and was *furious* that they went ahead and released it without consulting with her. That's not the sort of thing I'd generally lose a hell of a lot of sleep over, but all those lyrics about black female empowerment start to sound a bit awkward when you're hit in the face with the irony of the fact that that very vocalist's agency was taken from her in the very album you're listening to. I've always felt more than a bit weird about it as a result.",109

In the 70s, no one would admit that they liked Abba. You would  have to listen to their records guiltily at home, because they weren't  cool. Now it's fine. I like Abba. I did then and I didn't admit it. The  snobbery of the time wouldn't allow it. I did admit it when I heard  'Fernando'; I could not bear to keep the secret to myself anymore.

djutb3,"Billie Eilish, as I'm sure everyone here knows, has become extremely popular in the last 6th months. When things become popular, opinions are going to get a lot more mixed.

I understand if her music just isn't your thing, or if her persona is annoying. Not everyone is going to like everything. But I've seen mostly legitimately HATE for her, not the standard ""i dislike her music"" but people actually coming for her appearance, voice, calling her names and stuff like that. i think people tend to forget she's a kid. if you dislike her can you give any insight why?

dleyyb,"Even though this song is like 5 months old, I wanted to talk about this:I just don't understand how in the world no one spoke about it,I especially made a Reddit account to discuss about this.The song is very good and catchy, production is good and catchy, lyrics are good and catchy,But her voice - it's just so annoying.The song is good, I can listen to it a lot, but if I pay attention to her singing, it makes it annoying. It especially annoys me because it could've been a much better song if she just sang it normally, and I don't understand how she, herself couldn't see how annoying this could be.And I'm going to give examples:""And now I beg to see you dance just one more time"" - why would you say the word ""more"" with a ""B"" in it?""I‚Äôve never seen anybody do the things you do before"" - listen to this line, she just goes up an octave and makes her voice sound like a baby's voice.""And when you‚Äôre done i'll make you do it all again"" - again making her voice sound like a baby's voice, and one more thing - listen to these words ""make you do it all again"" or how she says it: ""make you do Vit all again"" - I guess ""it"" has a ""v"" in Vit.""See you see you seen you every time"" or how she says it: ""I seenk you seenk you seenk you every Time"" - what the hell did she think to herself, also T is capitalized in purpose, hear how she says it.Hear when she sings in 2:21, wouldn't this song be just so much better if she sang it normally, her voice is just perfectly fine if she sings normally no need to do some weird distortions to how she says stuff.There are more distortions she does, but I just specified the lines she distorts every time.What do you think? am I just over-reacting and I'm just listening too sensitive to the song?Or I'm actually right and the distortions annoy you too.I know there is no ""Right and Wrong"" here, I just wanted to see if more people agreed with me and noticed the distortions.TL;DR: Song is good but her voice distortions ruin it.",I suppose her odd way of singing pronunciation makes the song more memorable and makes it stand out more.,17
dr8zh7,"During ISIS' peak, the notorious terror group composed a number of nasheeds (Islamic a cappella songs), at least one of which (""Salil Sawarim"") achieved memetic status. On YouTube, you can find a number of remixes of the track as well as, for instance, [this piano cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bWI0J7Kxok). The thing I'm curious about is who owns the rights to the melodies and lyrics contained within terrorist propaganda? Its location of composition and recording is unknown, the performers and composers likely are either unknown or operate through pseudonyms (""noms de guerre""), and it's unlikely that it was ever registered with any copyright authority. Is Salil Sawarim in effect public domain, or is it in effect an extreme form of an orphan work in that it's copyrighted but the rights-holders are unknown? Does the fact that it's impossible more-or-less to prove who recorded it mean that it can be freely sampled and remixed without paying royalties?

dusc6f,"I love this  [album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounds_of_Love) to death. It's a masterpiece of modern music. However, it scares the shit out of me sometimes. No wait, most listens actually. Everyone who's listened to the album, knows the story. It's split into two halves - Hounds of Love and the 9th Wave. I always listen to this album at night, it feels right that way, usually when I go out somewhere during the autumn and winter period.  The tracklist strikes me as follows: Running Up That Hill (majestic, ominous, powerful)   Hounds of Love (pretty, artistic, catchy, lush)   The Big Sky (larger than fucking life, one of my 2 favs off the album)   Mother Stands for Comfort (pretty but also unsettling)   Cloudbusting (very pretty and joyful, but with a slight sense of approaching dread)    then comes the 9th wave, with these feelings: And Dream of Sheep (feelings of helplessness, darkness overcoming light)   Under Ice (scary and dramatic)   Watching You Without Me (chill, but something's still not okay)   Jig of Life (also dramatic but has some ominous tones to it)   Hello Earth (feels like staring into the vast darkness of space)   The Morning Fog (you can relax now, it's all over) What's exactly scary about this? Well, nothing in that classical sense. However, I feel a very dark chill in my soul when I'm alone with this album, some sort of existential dread. I remember one night walking on train tracks in pitch black darkness and listening to Hello Earth, feeling like the world will fall apart and be eaten by eternal night. The 9th Wave is terrific and terrifying at the same freaking time. And I love it. All the songs are beautiful on the surface, just like the Hounds of Love-part, but these strange rescue pilot transmissions, weird spoken word samples and water sounds that pop in and out randomly make me feel like I'm the woman that's drowning in the middle of the night - the imagee that Kate was aiming at. And no, I did not forget Waking the Witch... Holy shit is this song scary. I loved it on first listen, and it has stuck with me ever since. When I think of Hounds of Love, I always think of either The Big Sky or Waking the Witch. There's no dark album, horror soundtrack or anything that has every made me feel as uncomfortable as this song. I listened to the album last night while studying. I'm writing and singing along, and then I hear the many ""wake up"" samples. I get hyped because I love hearing the song. Then that satanic voice comes in and I'm just looking through the papers and feel like I'm witnessing an execution.  This is what fantastic music does to you. Thank you Kate, you gorgeous fairy of a woman.

dwulpr,"So many up and coming bands that seem to gain notoriety and popularity in underground (or music centered online communities at least) seem to be under this ""Bedroom Pop"" or rock umbrella.  Mac Demarco is probably the most famous artist to break with this label.  But there are other very popular bedroom pop acts that seem to break through and become quite popular. Rex Orange County just signed to a major label and released a project, and is embarking on a nationwide tour, for instance. Steve Lacy and Clairo are other artists who enjoy similar acclaim.  All this begs the question, is this the new/current underground movement of the generation? ____________ So what exactly characterizes bedroom pop/rock? To me it seems to be rooted in rock music, but takes a lot of influence from RnB and Psychadelic genres.  The aesthetics are important. It has to feel homey, as in... not made by a major label in a big fancy studio.  What do you guys think? ________________ What and who are some important bands in this bedroom pop movement? Who are your favorites? I personally really love the bands Peach Pit, Crumb and Cosmo Pyke. ___________ What bands/artists do you guys think are major influences? I see a lot of Pavement influence. Some of the DIY spirit of Hardcore punk, but much chiller.  Very large influences from neopsychadelica bands like flaming lips, of montreal, olivia tremor control, and even tame impala.  Some lo-fi influences from Sebadoh, Duster, Daniel Johnston  I see a large influence from chillwave acts like neon indian and toro y moi and modern RnB influences like frank ocean and blood orange. The problem is that ""bedroom pop"" is a very general term.","It's today's equivalent to 80's college rock, young people who are starting bands are making this kind of music really frequently these days. The prevalence of algorithm-boosted artists like Crumb, Mild High Club, Clairo (all really different but fit under the general umbrella) across Apple, Spotify etc obviously plays a huge part in it.  I'd say musically it's tied together by frequent and creative stylistic mixes of a lot of everything else that streams well with late high school to college aged kids. Alt R&B style drumbeats and sensual vocals, guitar playing that reaches all the way back into alt/college rock history (REM, Marr, Frusciante, the Strokes), and a lot of rap production staples like sampling, bass-heavy mixes, stylized autotune. Of course this kind of musical blend has been pretty popular since '16 or '17, and there's more generic versions of it out there, and the kids will move on eventually, but it's a pretty eclectic corner of modern music when you think about it. Now that some time has passed, I'd call Mac Demarco, MGMT, and maybe Beach House the godfathers to the whole scene, even though their music doesn't sound all that much like where bedroom pop has ended up. Maybe just in the sense that like most fans and artists in the 'genre' are big fans of them, and that you can trace that lineage pretty easily.",137
dxnyj0,"Lars Ulrich (drummer, Metallica, if you've been living under a rock) is a controversial figure in the metal genre and catches a lot of what in my opinion is undeserved flack. He is a serviceable but not particularly technical metal drummer who has been surrounded by some of the most talented and technically proficient songwriters and musicians throughout his entire career (particularly James Hetfield and Cliff Burton) so he comes across as a bit ... ""basic"" in terms of his musical skills BUT, you know what he's \*\*really\*\* good at? Reading contracts. Lars was on a straight up hustle in the San Francisco Bay Area during the early 1980s, pounding the streets posting flyers, distributing cassettes to record stores, landing gigs, and establishing Metallica as an underground favorite and within just a few short years (they were selling out stadiums by about 1984) ultimately become \*\*the\*\* biggest, widely recognized, and longest lasting heavy metal band of all time, aside from Black Sabbath. In the early days, he took on the roll of not just the band's drummer, but also their manager, marketing ""director"" and even in some ways their ""lawyer"" in the early stages of Metallica's career and put them on the map while many other thrash acts quickly faded out (e.g. Anvil) or were taken advantage of by record labels. Even after becoming ultra successful Lars was still one of the most vocal critics of early music sharing (or stealing, depending on how you want to look at it) services such as Napster in the early 2000s and spoke out on behalf of not just Metallica but many other musicians in the industry as well. He caught a lot of backlash for this but stood by his statements and is now generally looked back upon as being forward thinking in terms of the current situation with streaming services such as Spotify really hurting revenue for up and coming artists. Nowadays from what I gather from various documentaries, Lars spends most of his time enjoying his success (as do Kirk Hammett, James Hetfield, and current bassist Robert Trujillo), writing music with Metallica, and working on other passion projects like painting. When they're recording new albums, he typically seems to stroll into the studio around mid-morning wearing tracksuits after a morning workout and carrying a cup of Starbucks coffee while reviewing album masters and actively providing feedback (not always in a positive way) to the rest of the band. Trujillo in particular has mentioned how impressed he has been at Ulrich' s professionalism, driven nature, take-no-shit attitude, and self discipline over the last 15-ish years that he's played bass with Metallica. Who else in the music business has brought such important business savvy to the table and helped spur the progress of their bands *as well as* actively perform with them? What set them apart from their contemporaries and how long did they remain in the day-to-day operations of the business or financial side of their group?",RZA from Wu Tang is worth mentioning for not only suggesting the idea of creating a large rap group but also pitching the idea of signing the group to one label while each member signed a solo deal with a different label so the clan would have a huge amount of connections in the music business.,249
e0hvqp,"Currently I'm listening to [Furtw√§ngler's interpretation of Beethoven's 9th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHDXdbSWu0E). I love the recording and I think it raises interesting questions about the relationship between the ""form"" of the music (such as the grainy recording) and its actual content (the melodies, rhythm, harmonies, etc.) .  Though everybody seems to agree that Furtw√§ngler's interpretation of the 9th is the best out there, the fidelity of the recording doesn't seem great. The performance above is from 1942, and it shows: you can tell that the technology couldn't quite capture the whole orchestra and choir. The recording distorts at many of the performance's louder section, and especially often in the finale with the choir. Yet everyone still loves this recording despite how important high fidelity generally seems to be. Why is this?   The impression I get is that people don't enjoy this recording *in spite* of its technical ""limitations"", but rather *because* of them, at least in part. The distortion and lack of detail emphasizes the symphony's power by giving the orchestra a formal limitation to loudly push against, and leaving much to the listener's imagination -- a bit like how you'd show as little of the monster as possible in a horror movie. As a visual analogy, I think Furtw√§ngler's  recording acts like the [Venus de Milo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_de_Milo) . The statue is somehow more beautiful because of what it's missing (its arms and paint) compared to if it was perfectly preserved. The absence of a part of the work creates a more beautiful whole.  This line of thinking raises all sorts of new questions. To what extent does music exist in a vacuum, apart from the context in which it's performed or recorded? - is there such thing as a platonic ideal of Beethoven's 9th, outside of any formal considerations? There's also the obvious connection to lo-fi music: is what I wrote about connected to the appeal of lo-fi in other styles of music? Personally I think the appeal of it is different, but I want to know what you guys think. It's also strange to think about how a symphony by Beethoven can be influenced by formal elements that the composer had no way of considering in his own life. How might the next century's technology impact the way people will understand the music from our era?  How else has it already changed? I hope all this makes sense and that you guys are hearing what I'm hearing.","There's an incredible quote by Brian Eno on this: >Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. It‚Äôs the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart. The distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the medium supposed to carry it. The blues singer with the cracked voice is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases it. The excitement of grainy film, of bleached-out black and white, is the excitement of witnessing events too momentous for the medium assigned to record them. When we listen to the Furtwangler, we're not just hearing Beethoven's 9th. We're hearing how incredible the symphony is and how the technology couldn't even capture it. The pleasant effects of harmonic saturation from the distortion aside, it creates the sentiment that the work is greater than the medium, revealing it's power and emotionality through what we cannot quite capture.",187
e2pxhq,"I'm not just talking about his songwriting and performing role with Roxy Music, his art rock solo period, or his creation of ambient music and numerous subsequent collaborations, hell even the Windows start-up sound or his various apps of late, which all merit their own discussion. But rather, I want to talk about how often he worked as a non-musician, as the brains behind the mixing desk and the ways he approached sonics/sound design and worked with a litany of incredibly important popular and underground musicians of the past half decade. To get the conversation going, let's just look at his career resume real quick: His start first began in the late 60s at art school experimenting with tapes. He then began to hone his craft using tapes during live performances and in the studio circa 1970 - 1973 while as a member of **Roxy Music** before launching a sort of a arty, glam solo career. He also was one of the early inventors of tape delay which he used in early collaborative efforts with **King Crimson** and **Robert Fripp** as a solo artist. It was here that we saw Eno's sonic approach to drone and ambient music first emerge as well as the style of production he would use with other outside artists. Starting in 1974, he would work with former **Velvet Underground founder John Cale**, to produce his seminal avant rock album *""Fear""*, as well as its followup record. That year he also contributed tape effects and other musical elements to progressive rock band **Genesis**' magnum opus *""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway""*.  Eno would then work with and produce albums for a string of important musical figures, from modern avant-garde classical composer **Gavin Bryars**, the eclectic **Penguin Cafe Orchestra**, among others, as well as producing and assisting seminal proto-punk/proto-post-punk band **Television** on the early versions of ""*Marquee Moon""*. The late 70s and early 80s would see arguably one of his most creative and some his defining production works, including his approach to Ambient and Drone sonics under solo and collaborative releases with **Harold Budd**. Though not officially credited as a producer, his involvement was instrumental to the development with **David Bowie**'s so-called Berlin Trilogy of *""Low""*, *""Heroes""*, and *""Lodger""*. The electronic manipulation, avant-pop, and unsettling ambience of ""Low"" are classic Eno, as is the microphone manipulation on ""Heroes""' infamous title track, to name a few of the many examples. Eno's work on sculpting that sound was integral to the end product of the records and helped define who Bowie was to many listeners. At the same time, he began working with New York post-punk group **Talking Heads**, and over a three album period (*""More Songs About Building and Food"", ""Fear of Music"",* and their opus ""*Remain in Light"").*  Eno was responsible for pushing them musically progress in impressive ways incorporating many of these avant sensibilities, elements of funk, psychedelic/progressive style composition techniques, and burgeoning hip-hop production ideas, tape loops and sampling, as well as incorporating elements of world music and polyrhythms. They were already a great band, turned incredible (and highly influential and era-defining) under Eno's hand. At the same time too, Eno produced *No New York* with artists like **DNA** and **James Chance and the Contortions** among others: the incredible compilation of New York's experimental and abrasive No Wave sound that would pave the way for artists like **Sonic Youth**, **Swans**, **Glenn Branca.** So too, he would work with a little known band called **DEVO** on their debut EP ""Be Stiff"" and incredible first album *""Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!"" that too would become the stuff of legend.* His collaborative album with **David Byrne,** *""My Life in the Bush of Ghosts""* made around this time further pushes the boundaries of sound design with some of the most forward thinking avant-garde worldbeat, incorporating bizarre collages of samples of all sorts of spoken word and a foreign sounding voices and noises. Already he's contributed more in just 5 years than most people could in the 3 lifetimes, yet Eno kept going throughout the decade. He produced for and worked such a wide variety of groups and solo artists all across the musical spectrum that there's not time to name all of them. He worked again with some of his older friends/musical collaborators that I mentioned above, plus there were a litany underground new wave and experimental electronic artists from countries like Italy and Spain he worked with, prog rock band **Camel,** minimalist composers **Harold Budd** and **Terry Riley,** krautrock innovators **Kluster/Moebius/Harmonia,** New Orleans funk icons **The Neville Brothers,** UK techno/house pioneers **808 State,** art pop legend and former Genesis frontman **Peter Gabriel.** And going into the 90s, he didn't stop either. Even when busy with art installations and multimedia work, Eno was just as prolific as a solo artist, collaborative worker, and behind the scenes operator as he ever was. Shoegaze innovators **Slowdive** drafted him in to help carve out the sonic space and ambience on their standout album *Souvlaki.* Eno also produced for British indie pop band **James** on *""Laid"",* avant-garde pop and electronic icon **Laurie Anderson**, **Soft Machine** founder **Robert Wyatt,** produced **Bowie's** big comeback record *""Outside""* and worked on his left-turn Drum and Bass and Industrial music followup ""*Earthling"",* remixed **Massive Attack**,  worked on film scores and soundtracks, and a bunch of new age and modern classical from all across the globe. In this century too, he has remained highly prolific. Like before, he did a lot of work where his techniques ambient music, drone, and modern classical were applied to the that of many international artists in these styles, who are little known to the public (and to reddit) but vastly important in the art world. But in the realm of things more well-known to us, Eno worked successfully again with old friends like Wyatt, Bowie, Byrne, Cale, Fripp, Roxy Music's **Bryan Ferry,** as well as **Public Image Ltd.** bassist **Jah Wobble.**  His continued involvement with pop rock group **Coldplay** has proved successful as well, perhaps his biggest and most notable achievement in the 2000s to a younger group of music fans anyway. His contributions to their more mainstream albums *X&Y* and *Mylo Xyloto,* as well as other assorted songs by them in recent years, are highlights on what are otherwise solid, but not particularly interesting or groundbreaking affairs. However it was his work as producer on their album *Viva La Vida* and the accompanying, underrated *Prospekt's March* that is of real note*.* That album is, from someone who is generally neutral on Coldplay these days, honestly nothing sort of a minor masterpiece in orchestral rock and art pop. His touches and flourishes are all over the album and it's incredible. There's even a shoegaze track on there! How he got that sound out of them, I'll never know. I would argue that the more ambient take on the ""arena rock"" sound he's led Coldplay towards has been hugely influential on mainstream and indie rock of the past 15 years: from **The Killers** and **Arcade Fire** even to your Imagine Dragons and whatever.  He also worked with modern, cutting edge electronic artists  **Jon Hopkins,**  **James Blake,**  **Nicolas Jaar, Ben Frost,** as well as with the likes of **Damon Albarn** and **My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields.** And he's shown no sign of stopping yet - even at 71. &#x200B; So, how do we rate is legacy? What do we rate as his biggest accomplishments? What do we think he'll be most remembered for? Does anyone else even come close as a producer in the past 50 years?","I used to buy any record with his name on it, but his vocal solo albums are still my favorite.

e7g7mw,"I love album covers. When I go to a record store and start flipping the CD's of music I'm not familiar with, I always imagine what the music sounds like. I believe that context is important when it comes to music. The way a band potrays itself often makes the music better (or worse) for me. An album cover that perfectly fits the music, like My Bloody Valentine's Loveless or Radiohead's Kid A, sets up the mood for the listening experience before you even start listening. Album covers are also very good at portraying messages, like RATM's self titled or Kendrick Lamar's TPaB. I just feel that they add something important to the music. What do you think of album covers in general? How important are they? Do they affect the music for you? What are some of your favorite album covers?","I wouldn't say that a bad album cover takes away from the music, but sometimes a really good one can add to it. especially if the artwork matches the vibe of the music well. outkast's debut has IMO a really shitty cover but it's a great album; everything that tool has ever released is complimented by the artwork",186
e8f9bj,"I honestly have my doubts that this style of rap will even make much of an impact in 2020. Dying at a ridiculously young age seems to have become a trademark for SoundCloud rappers (Lil Peep, XXXTentacion and now Juice WRLD).  But even the ones that aren't dead seem to be going down fast. Lil Pump was yet another victim of the sophomore slump (the six month delay didn't help either). Lil Yachty's full length albums were vastly inferior to his mixtapes. If 6ix9ine ever decides to release a new song, it will probably be decades before he finally does. SoundCloud rappers that were briefly hyped as the next big thing have fizzled out as quickly as they came in (Comethazine and Wifisfuneral). Looking at the Billboard Charts right now, I'm seeing a lot of stale and second-rate rappers that are happy to copy the styles of the big name SoundCloud rappers without doing anything new or interesting. When I look at artists like Lil Tecca and YNW Melly (who are currently on the Billboard Hot 100 as I write this) I find myself asking ""Who the hell are these people? Is anyone gonna remember them in five years?"" I think SoundCloud rap will go down in history as a movement that burned out as fast as it rose because it's artists either died, had serious legal issues and/or put out lackluster follow-up material. And of course, a bunch of no-name bandwagon hoppers.","The music itself won't probably make it very far into the decade and might just pop back up years later as a ""nostalgic"" movement.

e8qwof,"So, to start off - I‚Äôm really not proud of this at all and I absolutely hate that I seem to be stuck in this judgmental mindset. I very rarely judge anyone for their musical taste if it seems genuine and unique to that person. Music is subjective and if someone gets joy out of something I dislike, they must just see something that I don‚Äôt, so more power to them. My problem is that I start getting judgy when I suspect someone‚Äôs publicly shared taste isn‚Äôt genuine. I frequently use rateyourmusic, and I like looking at other people‚Äôs profiles for recommendations. Often I‚Äôll come across people with extremely ‚Äòtypical‚Äô 5 star ratings ‚Äì Dark Side of the Moon, MBDTF,  ITAOTS, Loveless, a bunch of Radiohead albums, etc. And of course the vast majority of music in their negative spots is music that it‚Äôs ‚Äòokay‚Äô to dislike on RYM, like Fall Out Boy, Imagine Dragons, and Blood on the Dance Floor. Some people will go through the entire discography of an artist they hate and give .5 stars to everything, which makes me doubt that they even listened to the music at all. Come on, you‚Äôre telling me you don‚Äôt have a SINGLE ‚Äòguilty pleasure‚Äô or controversial opinion? I don‚Äôt buy it. The 5 star albums I mentioned are all albums I enjoy and agree are great, but I enjoy more than JUST those albums. There are plenty of obscure records and generally disliked records on RYM that I cherish, so I think if anyone looked at my profile, even if they think the music I like is god-awful (which is definitely fair sometimes lol), they would never doubt that my ratings were genuine. I know critically acclaimed music is critically acclaimed for a reason, but when it‚Äôs seemingly ALL you listen to and ALL you claim to enjoy...? I start thinking that person is listening to these things to appear more cultured and ‚Äòin the know‚Äô about music, and they aren‚Äôt approaching music with a good mindset. I don‚Äôt doubt there are some people who really do fake their music taste somewhat to look cool, but I don‚Äôt think this kind of person is as common as Judgment-Brain tells me they are. So...how do I stop thinking this way?","Honestly OP, take a break from RYM. Online people can easily rate their favorite music and their least, but completely skip out on all the other artists they listen to, or things they might not rate 5 stars. A lot of music taste is subjective, so you can't take much of it to heart. People don't have to put all of the music they listen to online, and probably don't. Don't worry about what others think of your music taste. We all like different music for different reasons, and whatever you gravitate toward might not be critically acclaimed, but is good to *you,* and that's all that matters.",173
eb7nic,"I know the Red Hot Chili Peppers often get a lot of flack in music circles, but the contributions of guitarist John Frusciante are mostly considered the best the band had to offer. He was (at least in part) responsible for their mainstream breakthrough on Blood Sugar Sex Magic, and the overall quality of RHCP's output can fairly accurately be predicted by whether he was in the band or not. On top of that, his solo output is very creative, stretching from lo-fi singer-songwriter to orchestral psych-rock (and more recently acid house, but that's more controversial). As a long-time fan, it's hard for me to predict where this is headed. Frusciante's playing style has throughout his career been characterized by his versatility, as he adapted his playing style greatly between albums (from funk on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magic, to minimalistic riffing on Californication and To Record Only Water For Ten Days, all the way to the Hendrix-inspired Stadium Arcadium). Frusciante's last rock album was the classic 2007 The Empyrean, and since then he hasn't put out a large-scale guitar-centered project. I don't think he rejoined the Peppers to continue making Acid House, but how his return to rock will sound is hard to tell. So what do you think? Will this turn the Peppers' fading relevance back around, similarly to how his first return to the group resulted in Californication? Or will they just put out another dozen of mediocre pop-rock tracks?","I look forward to the funk rock odes to California along with the occasional funk ballad odes to California.  I'm not so sure about relevancy as if anything their relevancy has lasted way longer than most people probably expected.

I could reply with ""I like experimental hip-hop"" and that would be true, since I do like experimental hip-hop, but it wouldn't be the whole truth since it's simply one of the many many genres I like. The only entirely truthful answer to this question would be ""I don't really have a music *taste* as much as I have a way of approaching, analyzing and digesting music. The genre is never a guarantee that I will like or dislike a piece of music, and I take pride in discovering and trying to understand as many forms of musical expression as possible.""

edtygf,"I‚Äôve met many musicians over the years, but nothing comes close to the time I met Blue Oyster Cult. The year was 1992, the place was the Seattle area and grunge was all the rage. I worked at a record store and BOC agreed to do a record signing to promote their concert that evening at a Howard Johnson‚Äôs motel. This was the lowest point of their career, long before they got a slight boost from the cowbell sketch. We had the store all set up with a signing table, piles of BOC CDs and some old school merch that one of the employees owned. The signing was being promoted on the local rock station, KISW. The signing is supposed to start at 5, and it‚Äôs 4:45 and there‚Äôs no fans and no BOC. The phone rings and it‚Äôs Buck Dharma: ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre trying to get to the store but we‚Äôre a bit lost.‚Äù I give him directions and 20 minutes later they pull up in a van. They wander in and Eric Bloom says: ‚ÄúI thought the signing started at 5.‚Äù All of the staff are trying to reassure the band that people will show up. To try to lighten the mood I make some dumb joke about how the band is even shorter than they look in pictures. Buck scowls at me. They take their place at the table and the 5 staffers (including myself) get our CDs and LPs autographed. The regional guy from the band‚Äôs label shows up and starts putting pressure on us to do something, but there‚Äôs nothing we can do. We can‚Äôt make people show up. The store manager calls KISW and gets them to make a few more announcements. Still nobody shows. A few people enter the store during this debacle, but they aren‚Äôt there for the signing and couldn‚Äôt be bothered to give a shit about BOC. After 30 minutes of awkwardness, the band throws in the towel and takes off. The whole scene is pretty much identical to the Spinal Tap scene. Later, we get into the show for free and are treated to BOC cranking out their classics in a former covered pool area. The sounds echo off the glass and the half-empty room drunkenly cheers each song they recognize. Truly a night to remember.","I went to the GA Theater to see Mac Demarco one night with my sister. We had a great time at the show, and as we were leaving, overheard some people mention Mac was chilling out on the roof top bar. He had already downed what seemed like a bottle of Jameson during the show so I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. We get to the roof and sure enough there he was. Chatting with members of his band and random fans. I posted up at the bar and chatted with this girl while I waited for my opportunity to approach him. After chatting with this girl for a bit and scoping out the situation, we noticed Mac heading up to the bar to grab another drink. I noticed and decided to seize the opportunity to introduce myself. I stood next to him next to the bar and ordered myself a shot of Jameson. I tuned to him and nonchalantly asked if he wanted a shot. He took me up on the offer, we did our shots, I asked if I could bum a cigarette which he obliged, but then things got a little strange. After doing the shot, (and excuse my ambiguity cause I had already had a decent amount to drink) he turned to me and did, what I interpreted at the time, this snake charmer maneuver gestures at my crotch. I know Mac‚Äôs a peculiar guy and found in kinda funny so I attempted to take it a step further in an attempt to show I could hang. I kinda pretended I was digging his advances and kinda gave him a look as if I was gonna go in for a kiss. I obviously didn‚Äôt actually go in for a kiss, but to my surprised, he met my gaze and reciprocated except he actually went for it. We had a small peck and he recoiled a bit and immediately apologized saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that was a bit forward. It‚Äôs felt right at the time though.‚Äù We kinda laughed and said it was all good and I was a consenting adult. He then introduced himself to me as if I didn‚Äôt know who he was and we had a decent conversation for 10-20 minutes. Really peculiar guy, but a genuine sweetheart.

efpwb3,"It's definitely the soundtrackification of indie/alternative rock/pop. The start of the 10's started out with a a pretty refreshing surge of indie pop-rock that was actually pretty great. I have some pretty fond memories of fun., Lumineers, Lorde and even the very early work of Imagine Dragons when they first came out. That sadly ended at some point in the mid-10s. I use the term ""soundtrackification"" because it sounds like this music's sole purpose is to be background noise for a commercial or movie trailer. The two biggest offenders are Imagine Dragons and Maroon 5. Imagine Dragons were so promising at first. They had an anthemic quality to their music that kinda reminded me of U2. Then...I don't know what happenned. They just became a dull lifeless, radio filler band. Wikipedia lists ""indie rock"" as one of their genres, but it's really a stretch to call the music of Imagine Dragons ""indie"" or even ""rock"". More often than not, I'm wondering if any of the members of the band, other than Dan Reynolds, even contribute to the music. Then there's Maroon 5. They've always been mediocre at best. Adam Levine's falsetto makes him sound like a muppet. But their early stuff at least had a human element to it. ""Makes Me Wonder"" has a nice funky groove that one can appreciate. Then ""Moves Like Jagger"" happened and they pretty much went the Imagine Dragons route of making radio filler that inexplicably manages to chart high on the Billboard Hot 100 even though you probably don't know anyone who actively listens to this type of music. As with Imagine Dragons, all of the non-singing members of Maroon 5 could quit and no one would notice. I think the biggest sin that the soundtrackification of indie is that almost every other rock and pop act started copying the big names to get radio play. I've lost track of how many disposable Lorde copycats showed up on the charts this decade. And in 2019, it all culminated in AJR's ""Neotheater"", which is probably the most uninspired album released this decade.\* I know, I could have gone with an easy target, such as how pretty much everything on the charts in 2018 was trap, but this is just worse to me. Hell, I'll go as far to say that Lil Pump has more DIY cred than Imagine Dragons. \*Fun fact: I've always assumed that AJR were a newly formed band that was created to ride on the coattails of Imagine Dragons. Then I looked them up on Wikipedia and I was shocked to find out that they formed in 2005. They're older than Imagine Dragons.","I'm probably gonna go with the Bro-step phenomena at the beginning of the decade. Although the early stages of dubstep happened in the late 2000s, the early 2010s were when it reached an insane level of saturation.  The fact the it got to something like a 55 second timestamp for a drop because every single song had the exact same tempo and song structure really shows how formulaic it became.",352
efze2l,"Continuing off of this post-->[https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/efpwb3/what\_would\_you\_say\_was\_the\_worst\_musical\_trend\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/efpwb3/what_would_you_say_was_the_worst_musical_trend_of/) For me, it would have to be that neat mini disco revival that lasted until around 2014/2015. It was pretty cool. It seemed like disco was making a comeback. I'm not talking about electronic Italo disco or Hi-NRG, I'm talking about like late-70's disco with orchestras and not much electronics. I don't know where it came from. Maybe it started when Carly Rae Jepson used strings on ""Call Me Maybe"". Or maybe it was Daft Punk who kicked it off with ""Get Lucky"". Either way, disco was finally cool again. All those anti-disco jokes were finally cleansed from the public conscious. But it didn't last for ever. I think it died with the ""Blurred Lines"" scandal. Another contender for me is how Soundcloud/emo rappers are actually keeping rock alive in the mainstream. I mean, take the posthumous Lil Peep song ""Cry Alone"". Take away the trap beat and it could have easily been something that Nirvana wrote in the early 90's. Then there's ""How You Feel"", my favorite song off of Trippie Redd's debut album. It's largely guitar-driven with nary a hip-hop element in sight. There's also the ""trap metal"" movement that's being pushed by the likes of Zillakami. Nu metal guitar riffs are all over Zillakami's music.","I feel like streaming is high up there, for one specific reason: For the first time ever, it gave underground/unsigned artists a platform for their music. Sure, it was there before, but not of this scale. Artists could be worldwide popular without having to leave their hometown. As Rob Scallon put it: ""With the way this all works, I don't feel I have to move to LA. I can stay in Chicago where I'm comfortable."" While streaming services unfortunately have to promote the big names to stay in business, we shouldn't forget what they mean to bands who wouldn't be popular otherwise.",196
egk8bn,"**R. Stevie Moore** was a trailblazer in lo-fi recording. He's been doing home recordings since the '60s. Ariel Pink, Mac DeMarco, MGMT, Neon Indian, etc. wouldn't be where they are w/o him. **Lois Maffeo** is a pioneer in both the riot grrl and twee pop movements. Came from Olympia and planted the seeds for bands like Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney, Kimya Dawson and the Microphones, and for labels like K Records and Kill Rock Stars. **Wendy Carlos** essentially brought electronic music beyond its classical parameters in *Switched On Bach*. That album was successful when it dropped, and she composed the score for *The Shining* and *A Clockwork Orange*, but nobody today even knows about her. Daft Punk cites her as an influence, she helped Robert Moog develop the Moog synthesizer, and she's one of the first public figures to be openly transgender. **Arthur Brown** was also mainstream during his formative years, but The Crazy World of Arthur Brown is obscure nowadays. He was the embodiment of shock value's second wave (Screamin' Jay Hawkins was that of the first), and Ozzy Osbourne, KISS, Alice Cooper, Mercyful Fate, Marilyn Manson, Iron Maiden and George Clinton owe a lot to him. The Who even covered him. &#x200B; What artists would you like to add to the list?","I‚Äôm gonna throw one out there that may or may not count as culturally significant. XTC, a pop group that formed in the town of Swindon, near London, in the 1970‚Äôs. They cut their teeth on the exploding punk music scene they were always a very unique band from the get go. Lead singer and principal songwriter Andy Partridge had a deep love for pop music such as the Beatles, the Hollies, the Monkees, The Beach Boys etc. and it showed up more and more progressively with each successive album. By their fourth album, Black Sea they had reached a perfect balance between the weirdness of the punk/new wave scene they came up in and the pop music they loved. In the words of Tears For Fears singer Ryan Orzabal ‚ÄúThey were a mix of Revolver era Beatles and the Talking Heads.‚Äù But still they moved onward, dabbling in industrial, gritty, rock to pastoral, acoustic ballads, Afro rock/world music, to 1960‚Äôs psychedelia, to orchestral, baroque pop. Compare a hit they had in the 70‚Äôs like Making Plans For Nigel, and then listen to a song like River Of Orchids which came out in the 90‚Äôs and look at the difference. It‚Äôs astounding. It speaks for itself. Partridge is one of the most legendary songwriters to have ever lived that nobody knows about. I‚Äôm talking Prince, Sly, McCartney, Max Martin, Pharrell, Stevie Wonder level of genius. His knowledge of pop song structure and how to write a hook is simply awe inspiring. That‚Äôs being said.... I don‚Äôt know how much I can claim XTC‚Äôs culturally significant when not that many people know of their work outside of the big hits like Dear God and Making Plans For Nigel. Their lack of touring really put a damper on any ability for the masses to hear them. And therefore for their influence to take root.",80
eh863j,"I've always thought of punk and metal as being two divergent streets, breaking off like a fork in the road from the blues based rock of the 60s. And I personally find the particular juxtaposition between these two genres to be fascinating. I think it says a lot about a person, depending on which path they choose to take. Before you start hitting me with downvotes... let's just get this out of the way... OF COURSE, it's possible for a single person to enjoy both punk and metal. I will say however, that I don't think I've ever met anyone who shared a near equal appreciation for each genre. There always seems to be one that comes more natural. I'm also struggling to think of a band that properly blends these two genres together (although, I'm guessing someone will have a suggestion or two). I'm going to take a gigantic swing here, but I've always thought that metal has an almost 'theistic' element to it. There always seems to be an inherent amount of sincerity imbued within the music, be it the dark mythology you find in black metal, or even hair metal's straight faced desire to get laid. Punk, on the other hand, seems to land squarely in the 'atheistic' camp. There's an intentional irony to it, a decent amount of cynicism, and often a desire to subvert conventions, not unlike post-modern paintings of soup cans. It often seems like a response to the perceived 'pointlessness' of life, society, the music industry, ect. There's also a heavy focus on 'alienation' as a subject and a theme. One of the best ways to visualize this split between sincerity vs. cynicism is by looking at various band photos. Which ones are taking it seriously, not even trying to hide the fact that they are intentionally cultivating a heightened image? And which ones look like they're putting in genuine effort to make the photo look candid or unimportant? I'll admit, it's somewhat difficult to talk about these ideas using terms as limiting as 'punk' and 'metal'. Suffice to say, I'm more referring to their trees of influence. This includes Joy Division, Nirvana, and Car Seat Headrest on the punk side and everything from Tool to Van Halen on the heavy metal side. There might be some pushback for including some of these bands in the same macro-category... but when you really break things down, I do think most of rock drifts towards one of these poles (theism vs. atheism, if you can handle more abstract definitions of the two). If you buy into this theory, identifying and attempting to reconcile perceived exceptions can also be quite fascinating. Jonathan Richman, for instance, is a huge figure within the post-punk world... and yet, some of my favorite songs of his are these sweet, happy tunes that, on the surface, appear to be entirely sincere. However, upon further inspection, you notice that his songs are often 'sincere' attempts at lifting the spirits of those who suffer from depression, ennui, and other responses to the loneliness and pointlessness of life. He also utilizes a decent amount absurdity and humor... which I also equate with punk and post-modernism. Andddddddd... I've run out of energy. &#x200B; EDIT: 1. I really appreciate people's feedback. It's got my pistons firing and even has me challenging a few of my own assumptions. 2. Part of me regrets including the paragraph which questions if one can love both genres equally, or if bands can occupy both genres equally. I'd change it to say that I'm kinda fascinated by those that do and would love to dive deeper into how that actually works. Am I imagining this contradiction of genres, or do these bands and fans have a bit of contradiction within themselves?","The challenge is in the examples you chose. I'm a huge fan of 70s punk. I'm also a  big fan of the better parts of heavy rock and metal. I would say your average [contemporary] fan of The Clash is likely to also be into Metallica. But is your average fan of Joy Division likely to be just as into Van Halen? I dunno. Maybe not.  Someone who loves the Damned probably also likes Killing Joke and Tool. Someone who loves the Buzzcocks and Echo and the Bunnymen might not dig Avenged Sevenfold.  Within these larger genres are textures that lean various directions. The Ramones aren't that far off the Foo Fighters. Same with the Sex Pistols. But these bands dont have the same feel as Joe Jackson or Psychadelic Furs.  So, no..not opposite ends of the spectrum. But I can see individuals liking some parts of both or either and not other parts.",137
ehplge,"I never posted here before and I don't have much knowledge of music. So excuse me if this post seems dumb. I don't like K-Pop that much but I read a thread in r/unpopularkpopopinions about [why K-Pop isn't taken seriously](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularkpopopinions/comments/bk8aa2/i_wonder_if_the_reason_bts_arent_treated_as_real/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). The Op suggested that it was because most of the fans are teen girls not because of xenophobia. K-pop idols aren't seen as real artists because of it. I realized that a lot of people judge certain artists or genres because their demographic is full of young people. Like older people judge younger people for listening to ""mumble rap"" or pop. Some mock artists such as Billie Eillish, Lil Peep, Justin Bieber or BTS because the fans are seen as annoying loud teenagers. Op in that post also mentioned that 5SOS wished they were seen not just for girls. (Don't know if that part is true.)  Edit: Yes, I understand that some BTS fans can get a little wild sometimes. Edit2: It's not my intention to sound like a social justice warrior. And I personally believe people dislike K-pop because it's from a different country, feels corporated and it's pop music. Not that many people like pop music including myself. I'm not agreeing with everything I said. And I don't listen to most of these people.  Edit3: I'm not talking about artists who are trying to target younger people. I'm talking about those who happened to have a young audience. I probably didn't use good examples because everyone is talking about industry plants here. And forget about female audience in the title.  Again I don't like K-pop","edit: my tl;dr take on what OP is asking about is this Twitter thread, with examples of insane reviews of Alanis Morissette: [https://twitter.com/TheRealADri/status/1145867723609690113](https://twitter.com/TheRealADri/status/1145867723609690113) Yes, this is absolutely something that happens. It‚Äôs easy to get mired in comparisons here between the genders of various fanbases and artists; all it takes is one act with a male-dominated fanbase that people disprove of for there to be enough sand thrown in the eyes of observers to muddy the issue. In general, though, art made by women or for women and girls is seen as less valuable by ‚Äútastemakers‚Äù ‚Äì these are critics, radio programming types, music historians, etc. You have ‚Äúfemale-fronted‚Äù as a subcategory of almost every kind of music, like it‚Äôs close to the real thing but not quite the same or some kind of novelty. There is a tricky line here between wanting to equalize exposure between women and men in music and fetishizing the former. But worse is when music is made by people expressing ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù emotions (as opposed to music coming from a traditionally masculine place that, while its own set of emotions, is often not even seen as emotional: it‚Äôs just the default, unexamined state ‚Äì anger, pain, horniness, good humor, brooding anime sword guy, etc. are given concrete descriptions beyond just ‚Äúemotions‚Äù) is considered ‚Äúgirly music‚Äù or music for girls. It‚Äôs either stated or implied who it‚Äôs for in a way that music ‚Äúfor boys‚Äù often isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs also assumed that things with any trace of inauthenticity might be ‚Äúmanufactured‚Äù in a unique way for girls or women ‚Äì and sometimes it is, but things like the Sex Pistols or hair metal are viewed on this meta level less often, or at least they have until recently. It‚Äôs a joke in Spinal Tap, even, where I think it‚Äôs Nigel explaining that girls don‚Äôt like the band because they‚Äôre afraid of the armadillos in the band‚Äôs trousers, which ends up including the aluminum that Harry Shearer stuffs in his ridiculously tight pants. The joke as far back as then is that these bands do staged shit for their own egos and that of their fans, but while the actors in the movie understand this isn‚Äôt uncommon for ‚Äúguy bands,‚Äù critics and laypeople have often not examined this or even noticed it. It‚Äôs just the default state, and looking into the default isn‚Äôt common in mainstream criticism. Again, it‚Äôs become vogue to do at least a little of this introspection now but that hasn‚Äôt been common in traditional tastemaking circles historically. And I think that, even now, male amateur critics have been particularly conservative and regressive in this regard. So, I can‚Äôt speak to K-Pop directly but this is certainly something that happens in the West. Lilith Fair, Cindy Lauper, ""the poetry of Jewel,"" Yoko Ono, pop era Beatles, modern boy bands, riot grrrl, disco, blah blah blah, have all been derided to one degree or another for being either feminine or for women and girls. Bikini Kill whips as hard as any other hardcore act and were so respected by a lot of their peers, but a lot of the praise they receive in the present is like a lot of praise MLK receives in the present, and you know this because the people doing it also express their views about present gender and race issues in a very regressive way. This isn't to say I *like* all those aforementioned artists, but they've certainly received more snide discussion around their gender or who they're for than, say, Metallica. I don't like Yoko Ono's music, but she and it are both taken less seriously than, I don't know, '80s No Wave. There have been multiple topics on this sub about Billie Eilish and how the press and fans and amateur RYM-style reviewers see her. It's both interesting that this topic is coming up more often and disheartening that there are as many people in here as there are saying that certain places perceive her particularly poorly not because she's young and a girl but because ""she whispers,"" a real thing multiple highly upvoted people in these topics have said, like their favorite thing in the world isn't early shoegaze (which often involved women but was mostly focused around the songwriting of men and was ""for"" men more than Billie Eilish is). It's hard to imagine some similar but guy act like that Hobo Johnson fellow, were he to become become as popular, getting the same style of analysis. People might not like him, and I don't, but their criticism of him would be more rigorous than what would be the equivalent version of the ""she whispers"" criticism -- imagine giving him a 2.5/5 because ""he raps... sometimes."" For what it's worth, I think the way music press and fans treat women in music and so-called girly music is unfair to men as well. Obviously not as much as it is to women, but it discourages guys from consciously acknowledging ""feminine"" emotions and creates unnecessary, backwards walls as gender no go zones. Guys *should* want to have fun, to cry, to flaunt it if they got it, to show weakness, etc. But these are things that, culturally, we make a pain in the ass to do, and men enjoy less of life because of it. And we treat each other and others worse because of it! Again, this isn't my main priority here, but for guys who don't believe that women and music for women aren't treated differently in music, I would encourage you to think twice about what The Culture has told you it is and isn't okay to be, and whether that might have anything to do with how we treat women. If you can see how this wider cultural sexism has screwed you over, it might give you a different way to see this topic, too. Anyway, while a lot of criticism of women in music and music for women is demeaning and condescending, I wouldn't mind a more adversarial music press and fan that pushes back against insincere music and corporatism in it more evenhandedly. Like, there's value in poptimism to some degree as an observation about past bias in music criticism, but there's no good to come from going so hard in the other direction that any slop a company more than a musician makes is worth praising, just because the company, as a way to sell it, says it's ""empowering.""",128

ekdo2m,"I feel like this is one of those things that everyone always knows in a ""well duh of course it does,"" kind of way. But I would bet that there are many like me that haven't fully grasped just how important a soundtrack really can be.  I almost feel like influence isn't even the right word and something like control would be more appropriate. If you guys have never done it, I recommend going and watching several famous movie scenes with no music at all and then rewatch the scene with the score added back in. It's night and day, the emotional response that any given scene can elicit from the viewers without the score. There's just so much more that can be conveyed with a well written contextual piece of music. It sets the pace and the energy of a scene so well and really lets you know exactly what the creator intends for emotional impact of the scene to be. Horror films are especially reliant on music and just sound design in general. Abusing the creepy music build up into a jump scare definitely becomes too much of a good thing pretty quickly and needs to be used sparingly, but with horror films especially the music really pretty strongly guides the viewer through the scenes and cues them in on when they really need to focus on what's happening. I think ""epic"" films or films with borderline cheesy really over the top heroic parts benefit a lot from good music as well. Im thinking of stuff like the speeches before a bunch of guys on horseback ride into battle like in The Return of the King or even in a modern film like the last big speech in Independence Day.  If I had to share one example it would be this piece in the second half of this clip from sinister. I've never heard a more unsettling horror movie tune:  https://youtu.be/9HEfWVc9Qk0 Anyways, just wanted to share.","On that note, watching The Wire made me realize how much film and TV tends to overuse music. On that show, there is only diegetic music playing with very few exceptions (such as the season finale montages). Thanks to that, the immersion is so much higher and on the rare occasion that they do use non-diegetic music, the score is even more effective. A pet peeve of mine is when film and TV goes overboard with the score to tell you how to feel, as if they didn't trust the acting and directing to properly convey emotions on their own. Also, I love the soundtrack to the Sinister films. I've never met anyone who isn't unsettled by the chanting on that Ulver song.",68
el36jb,"So basically I've always listened to music coming more from an instrumental sense i guess. I like mostly rap music, but as far as lyrics go, I don't understand them. To me music has always been relaxing and I feel like trying to understand song lyrics is too much effort. To me, lyrics are more like a rhythmic tool that works to flow with the song. However, a lot of times friends will recommend music to me because of how powerful its lyrics are, and I wont get it by just listening to the song like they can. When I actually talk about this with people it seems really weird, because even if I have all the lyrics memorized, I still don't quite understand the meaning and the overall theme of the music. So, I'm curious for people's thoughts on this, and I was wondering if there was anyone else that interprets music the way I do.","This is the way I am with foreign language stuff.

I like gangsta stuff too, but I prefer listening to the likes of A Tribe Called Quest, MF Doom, Run the Jewels, Kendrick Lamar, Digable Planets, OutKast etc. Growing up, I was aware of Eminem's popularity (even had a Slim Shady hoodie) but never really listened to him. We're all caucasian where I come from, and the hip hop my generation grew up with was basically Eminem, 50 Cent, Xzibit, DMX etc. Most of that stuff really doesn't appeal to me even today as I feel like they're trying too hard to be edgy. It feels more like the hip hop equivalent to the nu-metal phase many kids go through. Eminem is technically gifted and has clever lines, that seems to be the general concensus. I remember only being annoyed by songs like Not Afraid, Love the Way You Lie and We Made It which were on heavy rotation on MTV in my teens. I felt like he was to whiny, angsty, edgy for a grown man and his vocals sound like two angry Germans arguing in English. His newest material I'm also not fond of, nor the ""angry old man yelling at clouds""-image he's been embodying as of late. Still, a bunch of people look up to this guy for whatever reason. I decided to give his Slim Shady LP a shot, and it's actually fantastic. Sure, he's vulgar and over-the-top, but in a clever and cheeky way. It sounds like the type of music made to piss off exactly the type of people Eminem eventually became as he grew older. What is the enduring appeal of this dude? I can understand people liking his earlier stuff, but it has been 15 years or so since those albums. Am I missing something here?","I mean... Fleetwood Mac is still pretty revered in rock circles and hasn‚Äôt put out any new hits in decades.  I feel like answer to your question is in your question. He put out some good shit, had *the* top voice for a few years, and moved on. It happens. Hard to stay top of game relevant for 6 or 7 years, let alone 20. The Beatles went from unknown to broken up in what.. 8 years? I also think it‚Äôs his uniqueness. I like bands that don‚Äôt sound like anyone else or take unconventional but still palatable approaches, which I think he has. Anecdotally, I feel like those types of artists have more staying power in general.  My two cents.",313
er7tsu,"Idk about you but sometimes I find an album that hits so hard I have to be careful when I listen to it.  I have bipolar depression, I'm also very empathetic, and I've always had a passion for music. Being the way that I am, I find that I very deeply feel the emotions of a lot of music. Because of this I have found that certain albums are so intense for me that I end up kind of avoiding them, because they can really shift my mental state.  A great example of this is for me is the band la dispute, I think that they are amazing, the way Jordan writes lyrics and delivers his vocals are so raw and so intense. But it can be too much for me. A lot of their songs deal with depression and loss, in a way that I've never heard before. More specifically the album wildlife and tracks like a poem, all our bruised bodies and the whole heart shrinks, or harder harmonies. While these songs and this album is one of the best expressions of what it feels like to be depressed and go through loss that I've ever heard and they can be cathartic for me at times. I also have to realize that at the wrong time in the wrong place these songs can be so powerful that they can really put me on a different mental path that can be really hard to pull myself out of. I love them, don't get me wrong, I have bought all the albums I have seen them live, I own the T shirts, BUT I can't listen to them regularly. They do what they do too well.  Do you have any artists, albums, or songs that hit too hard? That are too real to hear regularly, even though you love them. What are they?

erhai4,"I've been thinking about this a lot, and with today's launch of the fantastic, kaleidoscopic [Radiohead Public Library](https://www.wasteheadquarters.com/), I thought it was worth considering what the legacy of the band will be when they eventually decide to stop making records. I've always considered Radiohead to be a bit anomalous. On one hand, they are universally beloved by critics, popular musical culture, the music nerd/snob establishment, and generally by the populace writ large. They've been nominated for Grammys and been put into the RRHoF, and every album since Kid A (yes, even King of Limbs) made it inside the US Top 3 on the charts. So they are not obscure, indie, or fringe - regardless of what narrative anyone wants to push. Another fun aspect of Radiohead is that they inhabit a space similar to what Pink Floyd does for Prog, Miles Davis does for Jazz, and Nas/ATCQ do for Hip-Hop - that being the gateway to deeper, more transcendental works of genre form. For many, *OK Computer* is a revelatory experience that comes somewhere midway through their musical education - and is one that tends to expand horizons rapidly towards everything from My Bloody Valentine, Talking Heads, and Sonic Youth; to Flying Lotus, Portishead, and the Cocteau Twins.  They have tremendous legacies on both the Rock n Roll and Electronic spectrums, and their individual musicians have gone on to do fantastic things individually - whether it's Thom's solo projects, Johnny Greenwood's stellar film soundtracks, or the underrated solo work That Phil Selway produced in the 2010s. They helped usher in the streaming revolution, many would argue, with the success of the *In Rainbows* pay model. Hell, they have 3 albums in the [RYM collective top-10](https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart), which is more than anyone including Floyd and the Beatles. For all intents and purposes, they were the most revered musical act of the 2000s, and bookended that by giving us formative releases in the 90s and the 2010s. One thing the band categorically refused to do is stagnate and ride the waves of success. *OK Computer* was celebrated as the most important album since Sgt. Peppers? OK, release a conceptual electronic album. Critics and audiences embrace *Kid A* anyway (I had never seen a shooting star, dammit!)? OK, back to rock and roll with HTTF. Think they're done in the 2010s? Release the ethereal, gorgeous, and celebrated AMSP, which dabbles in krautrock, folk, and chamber music.  And yet I can't but wonder what their legacy will be when they pack it in. Part of this is because their musical epoch came at a time when the type of music they play was not at the peak of the popular consciousness (unlike, say, the Beatles, Zeppelin, or Michael Jackson). Part of this is because the stuff generally embraced as their best takes effort and isn't as accessible as people want popular music to be. And, of course, they generally reject notoriety, fame, and the trappings of the rock-and-roll/popular music lifestyle. I genuinely believe that, when all is said and done, Radiohead's catalogue will rival that of The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Miles Davis, and Mozart in terms of quality and universal musical praise. I know that I'm not alone in that belief. And yet I also can't help but believe that, in popular culture circles at least, they will largely be remembered as ""'the band that wrote Creep'"". I don't think that they've made even a mild dent in popular culture writ large. Then again, I'm not sure they've really tried to.",I've been on r/radioheadcirclejerk for so long that I physically can't bring myself to write a serious comment about the band.,112
esxn0x,"Obviously there are artists which have their debut as their greatest work (Guns N' Roses, Nas, Wu-Tang Clan) but for the majority of the music it isn't the case. I personally prefer to listen in chronological order, even if it means to listen to some mediocre stuff too. In my opinion in that way you could see the artist evolve and grow artistically in different directions, especially more experimental acts like Radiohead, Autechre, Swans, Bjork, David Bowie. Probably it isn't the same with more straightforward bands but i guess any album is worth a listen. What's your opinion? Do you think there are artists/bands discographies that are better to listen in chronological order?","If it's an artist I'm not familiar with and they have 5+ albums, I'll listen to the best rated / regarded one first. If I don't like the best one, it's more likely than not I won't like the others. If I do like it, I'll look at their career more chronologically.

etvcwq,"I‚Äôm always fascinated by which music from the past gets rehabilitated and gains cool points and what formerly cool stuff gets set aside.

The obvious example I can think of is Rumours going from a dollar bin record when I first started buying vinyl around 10 years ago to a fixture of every hipster‚Äôs record collection with used copies going for at least $15-20.  So vinyl fiends, what do you notice customers seeking out? Any surprises? Any trends or artists about to have a resurgence that are currently bubbling under the radar?","I frequent several independent vinyl shops (frequent is an understatement) and I see a lot of people buying new releases on vinyl. Also, a lot of record labels are re-issuing classic rock albums on thicker vinyl pressings and people eat them up.

In my opinion, I prefer original pressings (at a third of the cost) even if they are not in pristine condition.",130
ev6adt,"This is an attempt to link together a couple of different threads that have been bumping around in my head for a while. It's sort of inspired by G√∂del, Escher, Bach and the way Hofstadter links together visual art and music. Music as a human activity is ancient. The oldest candidates for instruments are bone flutes approximately 40,000 years old, and simple percussion instruments or the human voice itself could predate humanity itself. We have evolved with music, and there are some things which are almost considered universal across cultures: rhythm, consonance, instrument classes like plucked strings or drums or flutes. We have been conditioned as a species to expect these things from music. For almost all of human history, too, music has existed under certain constraints. Instruments powered by human lungs and muscles can only get so loud. You can only get a few timbres out of a vibrating tube of air or a vibrating string, or the human voice. While I was visiting family for the holidays I went to the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, which has a large exhibition on view featuring the work of James Turrell. Turrell's work is an exploration of light as a physical object, and one of the things he has used in this exploration are what he calls Ganzfelds, after the psychological effect of exposure to unstructured, uniform stimulation. In the one installed at Mass MoCA, [*Perfectly Clear*](https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/phH1I996xWKLIJdJ2LugsA/large.jpg), a room is constructed with rounded corners to remove the sensation of an enclosed space, and the entire space is lit perfectly uniformly in gently changing colors, so that the viewer's visual field is completely filled with a single color. The effect is punctuated by periods of strobing lights. While I was viewing the piece, especially as my entire visual system was overloaded by the strobes, I could only think ""I am pretty much hacking my nervous system right now"". It is a stimulus that humans only can experience through incredible advances in technology, one that has hardly any equal in the natural world in which our vision evolved. In the same way, the extremely recent computer revolution and electrification of music has allowed for music to exceed the boundaries that had historically limited it. The ability to play sounds essentially indefinitely has led to explorations of drone, where instead of Turrell's hacking of our visual systems with a uniform field of color, we can force our hearing systems to contend with a single, barely changing tone or chord for an hour or longer Music synthesis and electronic processing of sounds have opened up timbral possibilites that there are no natural analogues to. The hoover synths, supersaws, and clipped kicks of a hardcore set, the deep subbass of hip-hop and trap, the distortion of noise rock, and the phasers and reverbs in shoegaze all present completely novel stimuli compared to the music we evolved alongside.  I think it's an interesting perspective to have as music continues to develop with a focus on tone and timbre. The thing that also interests me is what makes these new possibilities in auditory stimulus so compelling. How is it that we can find a huge bass drop so hype when there had never been a bass drop for the first hundred thousand years of the species? Where can we continue to push the envelope to provide novel sounds? Is all of this related to our drive for exploration of the physical world?","There is a field of study called psychoacoustics that deals with the psychological and physiological effects of music and sound, especially what happens when our senses are in disagreement in only a way that synthetic advances can achieve.  Some examples include digital combining a plucking of a stringed instrument and bowing but showing a video of someone doing one or the other. People have immense difficulty hearing the sound that our visual modeling doesn't support. You can clip the cacophonous ramp up of jumbled frequencies that proceeds a sustained musical note on an instrument and most people lose the ability to distinguish which instrument they are hearing. We literally hear drum beats with an exaggerated wind up to be longer than a short tap despite percussion having a fixed duration refractory period. We see video of attractive musicians and are ready to swear they play better than video recordings of homely musicians even if the audio track is the same. Layering samples of children or animals crying for their mother, even when chopped and distorted beyond recognition triggers an anxiety response on a subconscious level the audience cannot articulate.  I have always found the subject of noise to be interesting, how something as discordant as The Rites of Spring can inspire riots for its advant garde sounds but people have grown so accustomed to the dissonance to purchase records that are white noise drone or pay to see shows where people destroy bathroom fixtures with construction equipment for its sonic merits.",26
ex481q,"As was pointed out in Razbuten's famous *What Games Are Like For Someone Who Doesn't Play Games*, the process of labelling 'entry level' media rarely if ever involves the consulting of people at the entry level. I believe this has caused most lists or buying guides related to entry level media to be out of touch with what will actually be appealing to the typical music listener. I have singled out Jazz because it is so different from most popular music while still maintaining a quiet relevancy even after its departure from the mainstream. This combined with the genre's intellectual reputation means that people are more likely to keep trying to 'get it' at the cost of large amounts of their time and possibly self esteem. The listener combs the album over and over, waiting for it to 'click' because that is what so many people told them happened to them.  I firmly believe that the 'bar to entry' for enjoying jazz is much lower than these articles suggest. Before I explain why, I will acknowledge that my authority on this matter is limited in two respects. The first is that I have not listened to that much jazz. The second is that I do have some experience within jazz (I have both performed and mixed jazz songs) which means that my experience with jazz is not completely 'entry level'.  My argument will use Miles Davis' *Kind of Blue* as a case study. This is the album has been present on every list I have seen, and with good reason. It is widely considered to be the best jazz album ever created and its composition and stylistic directions are relatively palatable for a traditional jazz album. But I would argue this is not enough to make it 'beginner friendly'.  I have no doubt that *Kind of Blue* was once an ideal beginner jazz album, but it seems to have held onto this title even though today's popular music is almost unrecognisable when compared to that of the 50s and 60s. I think this label is no longer deserved through no fault of the album itself. I merely believe that *Kind of Blue* is too stylistically removed from what most people listen to to be accessible let alone entry level. The following contribute to this issue: ____________ *Kind of Blue* is a very low-key album. It starts off subtle and rarely goes beyond moderate. This is what makes it perfect background music as well as something to be payed attention to (much like how Brian Eno described ambient music). But it is this attribute, paired with only a few mid-song dynamic changes, that the typical music listener will boring. It can be argued that the prominence of trap and trap influence in current popular music has resulted in an overall 'low-key' sound in the Top 40, but that sound is still 'active'. As spaciously-arranged and non-impactful as those songs are, they often have a notable amount of momentum generated by distorted sub-basses and rapid hi-hat patterns. This is often reflected in trap music videos, which typically feature both moody lighting and energetic movement. 'Kind of Blue' is comparatively less energetic.  *Kind of Blue*, like most classic jazz albums, features a great deal of improvisation. Now admittedly, these are pretty tame compared to what many people, including Miles himself, would do in later years. They are often described as tasteful, and that is appropriate. But that doesn't change the fact that instrumental improvisation is not really common in modern popular music. Older listeners will be able to remember at least one guitar solo as well as their own address, but younger listeners will not have had nearly as much exposure. Even modern country guitar solos are usually written rather than improvised. So asking a typical listener to go from listening to a few instrument solos a month to an album which contains songs with more improvised parts than written is a bit much. The songs on *Kind of Blue* are looooooooong. It is true that the advent of music streaming means that the 4 minute limit imposed on songs by the radio is no longer existent. However, a look at Spotify's *Today's Top Hits* playlist on any given day shows that the most popular music on streaming services is regularly below the 3-minute mark. What this means is that a typical listener may not be ready to listen to a musical idea for 5 minutes let alone 9.  _________ One counter argument is that hip hop and trap audiences are primed to listen to classic jazz in the vein of *Kind of Blue* due to the prevalence of jazz samples in the music they enjoy. But it important to note that these samples are short and their isolation from the rest of their original song makes it much more repetitive than a jazz song typically is.   Another is that, while it is not accessible overall, it is accessible for a jazz album. Maybe so, but I believe there are better examples. Here are a two albums that I have gotten into despite, as previously mentioned, not being that into jazz. For the record, I do not blame any of the list makers for not being aware of these albums. **The Rippingtons - Kilamanjaro (1984)/Tourist in Paradise(1989)** The Rippingtons have the reputation of being one of the few actually good smooth jazz bands. They take no shame in being part of the genre, making liberal use of keyboard sounds and genre blending to the point where you may question whether some of the songs on these albums actually count as jazz. And it is this lack of purity that makes these two albums (and their whole discography) so accessible. It has elements that can be enjoyed by fans of synth pop, hard rock and soul. The tone of these albums are bright and bouncy and I don't remember hearing an improvised solo on either album. Many of the songs around this era of their music can easily be compared to soundtracks from games in the PS1/N64/Saturn era. You would be correct to point out that any listener young enough to not be used to improvisation in music is too young to have played any of those games. This is true, but hauntological artistic movements such as synthwave and vaporware (and to a lesser extent, lofi) have reintroduced these sounds and styles to a younger demographic, making the release date of these games only slightly relevant. Neither of these genres contain much use of improvisation either. Regardless, console emulation is also popular with younger demographics. **Mammal Hands - Shadow Work (2017)** *Shadow Work* is leagues closer to *Kind of Blue* than anything The Rippingtons have ever done, but there are still key differences. The first is that these are fantasias, which means they sound vaguely improvised but aren't. This is important, because the melodic and tonal progressions in each song will sound more 'deliberate' than an improvised solo while still keeping a level of unpredictability. The biggest turn-off in jazz is that people think the musicians are ""just playing random notes"", and songs like these introduce the idea that non-traditional musical phrases are valid too. *Shadow Work* is undoubtedly much less accessible than the two albums by The Rippingtons due to its removal from anything that has ever entered the Top 40 (besides Kenny G, if we are in the mood to make hurtful comments today). But I personally think that this album has many cinematic qualities to it, from the clear and spacious production to the abundance of vivid motifs (among other things). Interest in good film soundtracks seems to know no age, so I can absolutely see these characteristics making this album more accessible even though they do not bring it closer to songs in the Top 40. If you like Mammal Hands, know that they're style of Jazz has been dubbed 'ECM jazz' after a respected label. Check them out for hopefully similar albums. I am aware that two albums is not enough to make a list, but these are just meant to serve as examples of more accessible jazz albums.  u/buffynoyolo has a more comprehensive list based around preferred genres. **Questions:** What is your take on 'beginner albums' lists? Do you know of any other jazz albums that you would consider beginner-friendly? **READ THE STICKY MOD COMMENT**","I think that the entire idea of universal beginner jazz albums is just absurd. There is more than one way of getting into jazz. I think that fans of **metal and rock** music should start with *Mahavishnu Orchestra* and 80s *Allan Holdsworth*. It's guitar-driven, rock-inspired music. They will find it far more accessible than something like *Kind of Blue*. Fans of **electronic music** can jump into *Nils Petter Molv√¶r*, *David Torn*, *Knower* as those artists draw from the styles familiar to them. Fans of **noise music** can safely hop into *Peter Br√∂tzmann*, *Art Ensemble of Chicago, Big Satan, John Zorn* and so on. Fans of **(lo-fi) hip-hop** can investigate the 70s jazz-funk recordings the genre often samples. It's entirely possible that jazz is in such a sorry state popularity-wise because the same decrepit 70 year old albums are being constantly recommended to everyone regardless of their musical background.",157

f045if,"Wether it be producers, audio engineers, cover art artists, frequent collaborators and guest musicians...etc  The legacy of a band can also contian multiple figures that were not members of the band themselves, due to the work those figures contributed to their output.   While George Martin is an extreme example of the level of input a producer can have on a band, not only producing but contributing musically for the band as well... I am asking what other figures (to a lesser degree) can fit that same mold?  What figures are linked to certian bands or musicians from those behind the scenes jobs?  ------------- I think the easiest examples to trace are artists that collaborate with a band on the cover art for that band's discography.  While alot of bands move from artist to artist, not relying on one artist to design the front covers (and liner artwork) for their albums.. there are a handful of artists out there that will always be linked to a band through their art.  People like Storm Thorgerson (Pink Floyd), like Hugh Syme (Rush), or most notably IMO Roger Dean (Yes).  These artists are largely responsable for the iconagraphy of a band and should be lauded as such.   Beyond cover artists there are many bands that use frequent producers...some that help define that band's sound (at least during a specific era).  One example that comes to mind is the work that Steven Wilson (ex Porcupine Tree frontman) did with the band Opeth.  Wilson produced three of their albums in the early 2000s (Blackwater Park, Deliverance and Damnation) and really spearheaded the band's sound in what is arguably the best period for the band (2000-2008).   Wilson also had a hand in mixing the band's 2011 record (Heritage) and given similarites to what Wilson had going on in his own solo career, proably also had hand in influencing the band's sound in the 2010s.  (That and his close personal friendship with Opeth frontman Mikael Akerfeldt)  One other example is not from a produciton standopoint, but coming from the stanpoint that she is used at a guest vocalist for not one, but two particular musicians..  That is Anneke van Giersbergen.  While she is far and away an accomplished singer and musician (fronting multiple bands) in her own right... she will always be linked to the music of Devin Townsend as well as Arjen Lucassen (Ayeron).  Her frequent contributions to the efforts of both these artists, while not being a member of their bands... will always be a highlight of what magic can occur through frequent partnership.    ------------ So those are my examples,  what are some of yours?

f0xmc6,"This is a very common sentiment I've heard. Just scroll through the comments of any 60s/70s/80s/90s song and you're bound to find someone longing for the glory days, and complaining about today's music. Personally, this sentiment always annoyed me. I always assume that people are just remembering the stuff they like, and aren't acknowledging all of bad/mediocre music that was also popular around that time period. But perhaps I'm missing something. Perhaps there's people out there who hold this viewpoint, but who have more nuanced reasons beyond just selective thinking and blind nostalgia. But I've yet to hear a compelling case for music as whole going downhill. The most objective thing I can think of is that rock music's relevance has dwindled over the past decade. But I don't think this equates to music as a whole going downhill, especially when there's been so much innovation in other genres. Plus there's still plenty of great modern rock bands with decent levels of popularity, even if they're not charting on the billboard hot 100. Anyway, what are your thoughts on the whole ""music going downhill"" sentiment? Do you think it holds any water, or is it just blind nostalgia and selective listening? I'd love to know your thoughts.","While nostalgia for youth is certainly a factor in this, I don't think this is *simply* a matter of generational nostalgia. Because although that does happen, I have found that this mentality exists across generations, and not just for the music of people's youth. The 60s-90s time period in particular tends to be emphasized across multiple generations. This is where the whole ""Le Wrong Generation"" idea comes from; young people whose taste has been built around music that specifically is *not* the pop music of their youth.  The cut-off for this nostalgic era of music generally tends to be 2000 (although to be more restrictive, probably the mid-90s). I think the reason why is that this time period is gradually  becoming cemented as a sort of ""Golden Age of Popular Music"" in the culture. This was the time period in which the culture around popular music as we know it today was born and bred. In this time period, music became the first form of modern media that anyone could just go out and buy without too much expense. It wasn't until the 80s that movies became available in the same way through VHS, and it wasn't until the 2000s that TV became available in the same way.  In this sense, during the time period from the 60s through the 90s, music was the main form of media that could be enjoyed at your own leisure. You could sink your teeth into it in a way that TV or film or video games didn't really allow for. As a result, a lot more ""out there"" music could live in the mainstream and be popular. I mean, how else could an oddball and goofy band like Emerson, Lake & Palmer have gotten so big in the 70s?  And I think that's one of the biggest things: the beloved stuff back then could also be popular and mainstream. Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd weren't these weird bands that only art student hipsters listened to. They were very present in mainstream culture. In today's music culture, a sort of modern equivalent of Pink Floyd in concept (no matter the genre) would largely be limited to a niche subculture than be allowed free play in mainstream culture.  This brings in what I was saying about music vs other forms of media today. In general, our culture has shifted the emphasis we used to place on music into other forms of media, like film and TV (especially in the streaming era). We can now sink out teeth deep into stuff on Netflix in a way most people were never able to do before and that is much more engaging to our culture as whole now than music is.  Now this isn't to say that we don't like music anymore. It's just shifted into performing a different role. The mainstream music industry has become much more laser-focused on ""pop"" and much less allowing of weird idiosyncrasies (unless they came meme their way into the mainstream). And a lot of music that would have been given a mainstream chance during that time period is now largely funneled into whatever niche subculture it most relates to, and there it stays.  As a result, being into music becomes a much more active venture than it used to be. Again, people in the 70s didn't have to go find Pink Floyd, mainstream culture brought Pink Floyd to them. And if you are someone who doesn't want to dedicate all of the time required to go find the music you want to listen to (especially if it's not ""culturally relevant"" and something everyone you know is going to be talking about), then the only stuff you're hearing is the most mainstream of music. This person hears this stuff and remembers the music they liked when they were younger and says ""wow, what happened?"" Sure, ""bad"" music was always around, but the ""good"" music was there too. And now the ""good stuff"" is music that is no longer coming to them the way it did before. Again, I'm not denying that nostalgia for youth certainly plays a role, but I think there are a lot of other factors too, particularly the shifting role in our culture of music.",250

Those artists had a more even split between sad and non-sad songs while modern lo-fi artists tend to write sad songs much more often than not (Car Seat Headrest, Crywank, Alex G, every lo-fi hiphop producer, etc.) Why is this? Are people just sadder now or is this just the current zeitgeist? Do you know any feel-good lofi songs/bands/albums? I've been listening to Glass Beach's first album, which I would describe as mostly happy lo-fi for the most part.","In my opinion, the older artists were just better at masking their sadness.  The newer bands you listed are just less subtle.  Daniel Johnston was a monumentally sad person and lyricist.  His music might have sounded happy, but if you listen to the lyrics, the dude is in pain.  They guy suffered from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for God's sake.  Same goes with Neutral Milk Hotel.  Jeff Mangum, the main lyricist quit the band because his anxiety was so intense that he couldn't perform.",120
f338wb,"These robotic sounding a Cappellas feel and sound so unique to me. First, I‚Äôm wondering if there are more examples of this style of music. Although this style seems to have made its rounds in the late 2000s, have you heard this style in recent years. And secondly how difficult do you think it would be to make music in this style? It would require a large amount of planning on the chords and working through the melodies, not to mention the voice lines required by a single person. And to finish it off I‚Äôd just like to appreciate how smooth and calming these songs are.",I loved Hide and Seek by Imogen Heap.

f53ut3,"Maybe such an opinion won't resonate with this sub, but whenever I speak about music with my parents they always bring up how much lyrics mean to them but I never really felt a deep emotional connection to any lyrics. The lyrics I find myself enjoying a lyrics that tell stories mostly such as lyrics by Steely Dan or occasionally some James Taylor. To me, music which can express emotions without words through sound alone always felt stronger and more impressive. Classical works like Wagners Tristan and Isolde prelude and the end of Mahlers 3rd symphony express more emotion than I will personally ever get from lyrics. Plus some music is just genuinely fun and exciting to, especially up tempo modern jazz or Stravinskys Rite of Spring. I personally don't think that lyrics will help excite me in that way. Does anyone else have a hard time adhering to lyrics.","When lyrics matter to me, they *really* matter. When they don't, they **don't**. It's funny how lyrics behave that way.",175
f60jbo,"Living in the UK, my mother was 11 years old when she first heard Elvis Presley. At  17, she went to see a band at a local pub with her boyfriend (later my dad). It was The Beatles before 'The Beatles ' fame begun . My sisters and I was beside  ourselves with excitement when she told us that. Her answer to ' that is so friggin cool' was( cover your eyes Beatles fans )  ' They were ok. Nothing to rave about!'( a bunch of posers, was my dad's reply). She refused a friends ticket to see The Kinks. Missed seeing The Hollies. Did get to see Herman's  Hermits, yet again not fussed about boy bands. Never got to see Elvis. She was ok about that. His music was enough. Will always be a Elvis fan but  over the years, she has introduced new artist that she still loves. Elton John.  Got to finally see him 3 years ago. She was ecstatic. I can't imagine what she would of been like if she got to see Elvis. Is Elvis the only artist not to tour around the world? If so, how did he  command such a following?  Are there any members here that got to see him perform live? If so, please share your experience.",The Beatles‚Äô music speaks for itself.

f6woib,"Ok, I've been thinking in writing this post for some months already, but I wanted to make sure to do my research before doing it ([I discovered many old and new bands I didn't knew](https://pastebin.com/M1sK9XPY) ). I don't know if there are too many rock/metal/punk/indie/etc fans around here, but I'm fearing that rock is becoming an old people's game at best, and a stagnant genre on the dawn of its oblivion at worst.  And don't get me wrong, I know there are some innovative bands and even a few scenes around the world with good health (scenes like [East Asian](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqMOy8oeUv6FTizce4XpwsVhIqBMOmOl_) [math poprock](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAaVHEALFlBh-wzqKpeAGsGpP_pqq4MN-), [Russian post-punk](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqVOBLN43tSddjUzpfo0_tx38WTt7Yunq), [Mongolian folk rock](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr5VbNXganDvMJK_O4OAv3edijXzxTL1c)  are heartening examples of it), but I've noticed that: 1. Most innovative bands (I'm thinking in bands like [Zeal and Ardor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ_jpL_v-JA) or [IDLES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W6zK9givao)) fail to create scenes and subsequently, new genres. Innovation gets isolated, which could be fine in some way, rock tended over the decades to create many unnecessary  clone bands in my opinion, but truth be told, less clones means less exposition of new sounds, less notoriety. A new rock band can achieve a really interesting song, release an EP, play live some seasons and then fade into obscurity (like [this band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz13vitZKTo) I had the pleasure to listen last year, and last week I discovered they no longer exist). 2. I can't deny there are many bands doing new stuff, but most of the time, are exactly the bands that have been around for decades. For example, Bring Me the Horizon gave us their refreshing [Amo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_khx9NL25QwRzEnWPK6d8FPSFDNAKzz894) last year, but they have been there since 2003. On the side of metal, acts like [Darkthrone](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mP3mYtEEV5cY8593gLcC9XBN0F0pBo9hQ) and [Ihsahn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqv24yGoeo) have done their things, never letting themselves to get stagnated despite their decades-long careers, but honestly, these are the same artists we have been reading about on metal magazines since I was 4. And similar things can be said in other genres. What do the newer generations of rockers have? (not a rhetoric question, I really want to know). 3. As I said before, there are too many formulaic clones of ""old"" bands, and labels love it (probably rock fans love it too). Most new rock bands, specially the ones backed by labels, sound like clones of The Strokes, The Arctic Monkeys, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Sodom, Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam, Imagine Dragons, The Offsprings, Sepultura, Mastodon, My Chemical Romance, Rammstein, U2, Motley Crue, Imagine Dragons, Lenny Kravitz, Arch Enemy and a big etc. It's like, at some point, the rock industry said fuck it and started spamming cheap rip-offs (and some cool rip-offs along the way, I must admit). Honestly, I don't care too much about rock's popularity on the mainstream charts or how money it can make for these firms, I'm more worried about the fact that the spam is huge, and every time I try to discover new metal bands, Spotify and Youtube spam me with whatever Nuclear Blast is spitting, the same for any other genre with labels like Rough Trade, RCA, Epic or Virgin EMI. Again, there are some great new bands on these labels that also happen to follow proven recipes (like the indie [whenyoung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr8kWJZUGXM) on Virgin EMI), but those are more exceptions than the rule, and it is becoming increasingly hard to separate the wheat from the chaff.  So, more than a rant, I wanted to share this totally subjective observation. I barely play guitar and bass, and the only band I ever had sucked, so I'm not particularly in a position to throw shit to the few artists trying to put their rock tunes out there.  I'm just worried by the state of the genre. I know I'm not the first one to pose this question, and I even dismissed it for years, but now I'm wondering if we indeed are seeing the slow decline of rock. Who knows? Maybe in 15 years the younger people will see rock music as the people in the 30s saw waltz. What do you think?","The current rock scene is much like the world of music gear. Everyone has all of a sudden been enamored with old, analogue technology and now it‚Äôs all the rage to re-issue old models of amps, guitars, and synths, or to create update clones of this old idea.  Few major music manufacturers are putting out totally new and radical designs, and when they do they‚Äôre no where near as popular as the newest Moog or Fender reissue.  Similarly, rock music has been looking back to the past fife a while now, trying to emulate what was done back then. Tame Impala and King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard both hark back to the days of late 60‚Äôs psychedelic and acid rock.  But that‚Äôs not to say there isn‚Äôt innovation. That‚Äôs exactly what the Strokes where doing in the early 2000‚Äôs, looking back to early 60‚Äôs garage rock and proto-punk if the 70‚Äôs with modern production and pop appeal. That basically set the standard for rock in the 2000‚Äôs, and basically every band would take this approach. Arctic Monkeys fused this with classic English bands like the Smiths and the Stone Roses. Franz Ferdinand threw in dance music from the late 70‚Äôs. White Stripes leaned on classic blues. The Hives incorporated late 70‚Äôs punk. This idea of looking to the past is not new and fueled the great wave of rock music.  As the 2010‚Äôs approached, the standard for production was much different than 10 years prior. You start to see gleaming, crisp pop production take over, something garage music couldn‚Äôt hold up with. That‚Äôs where bands like Tame Impala and the new-and-improved (for the 2010‚Äôs) Arctic Monkeys come into play. They went in and developed this new pop sheen, which kept kept their relevance alive. I could list a hundred different rock bands that followed suit, but bands like the Foo Fighters and Red Hot Chili Peppers, this style doesn‚Äôt translate well. Many bands fail to come up to the standards of the 2010‚Äôs in a very similar way where a lot of bands failed to adjust from the 70‚Äôs to the 80‚Äôs.  That‚Äôs where bands like King Gizz, IDLES, Swans, and black midi come in. These bands really made a name for themselves based on the whacked out new sounds they were making. Sure King Gizz takes a lot from 60‚Äôs garage, but they also blend in hard rock, metal, and very bass heavy modern sound. Sure IDLES look back to 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs punk, but their lyrical ideas and fun attitude keep it sounding fresh. Sure Swans look back to 80‚Äôs noise and post rock, but how they approach it is very new. An album like To Be Kind just could not have been released in the 80‚Äôs.  While rock music isn‚Äôt at its fullest potential currently, this desire for something new is pushing in creativity. Once more bands hop onto this new idea as opposed to gripping so closely to the past, that will be the day rock music regains it‚Äôs former glory.  Personally, I believe it will happen over the course of the next year.",208
f8gn5y,"When I listen to old jazz music, with the exception of the 20s big band stuff,  I imagine it being played in a hole in the wall overly crowded smoky bar, and everyone in there is just cutting loose and dancing and really feeling the music, not just listening to it, you know what I mean? I know jazz isn't really popular these days so many of you probably have no opinion on the difference between old and new jazz, but I really feel like modern jazz doesnt occupy the same space that it once did. I basically dont listen to contemporary stuff outside of solo jazz guitar or solo piano as that particular style is somewhat timeless, I suppose due to the restrictions of having to accompany oneself.  But I just hate the perception people have of what jazz is. It's mostly seen as stale old peoples music to be listened to the same way aristocrats watch an opera, or quietly stroll through an art exhibit. I cant imagine being any farther from what it used to be and the kinds of people that used to enjoy. I suppose part of it is due to time and it happens to most genres. Eventually everything that was once ""cool"" becomes ""dad"" music or dad shoes or whatever. I do think jazz has suffered from this a bit more than other genres due to how it's been academically repurposed and has come to exist as America's classical music.  Are there any other jazz fans in here? What do you guys think?  Do you like any contemporary stuff or do you mostly listen to stuff from the past? I would kill to find some beat up dive bar with guys playing real rough around the edges old school sounding stuff. I feel like the modern stuff is so tame. There are exceptions tho. I enjoy snarky puppy, and some Robert Glasper stuff but both of those are more jazz influenced I feel like but idk, maybe they're both true blue jazz by today's classification.","‚ÄúModern jazz doesn‚Äôt occupy the same space as it used to‚Äù You‚Äôre right. And that‚Äôs always been the case with jazz. From Ragtime to Big band to Bebop to Fusion, jazz has constantly re-invented itself and incorporated new musics, technologies, and political/social messages. The fact is, we aren‚Äôt living in 1920 anymore. Or 1965. This is 2020, and modern artists in jazz (like any other genre), are writing music relevant to modern times. Maria Schneider‚Äôs most recent big band record deals with late stage capitalism and corporate greed.  Robert Glasper‚Äôs recent collaboration with Common and Bilal has yielded powerful music that speaks to social issues. So has Christian Scott for that matter. Gerald Clayton, Marcus Roberts, and Christian McBride have showed us that swing is alive and well, and technical ability will always remain at the forefront of the genre. Kneebody, Donny McCaslin, Snarky Puppy, have taken fusion to some crazy places. I could go on... In 2020 music is more splintered and diverse than ever before. Artists take music to more places than ever. They bring up different issues tell their own stories. They aren‚Äôt afraid to make jazz that ‚Äúisn‚Äôt jazz‚Äù. If you think jazz is too academic stop listening to academic jazz. There‚Äôs so much music out there.",108
f8r8z5," Music therapy is an evidence-based treatment form that systematically  uses sound-making and ‚Äúmusicking‚Äù (singing, playing and listening) to  help people in recovery and people with special needs. Typical goals are  establishing, or re-establishing, physical functioning or psychological  meaning, finding hope and enhancing quality of life, or developing  resources and opportunities for interaction and communication with  others.   Some common music therapy practices include developmental work  (communication, motor skills, etc.) with individuals with special needs,  songwriting and listening in reminiscence, orientation work with the elderly, processing and relaxation work, and rhythmic entertainment  for physical rehabilitation in stroke victims. Music therapy is used in  some medical hospitals, cancer centers, schools, alcohol and drug  recovery programs, psychiatric hospitals, and correctional facilities.  &#x200B; Evidence suggests that music therapy is beneficial for all individuals, both physically and mentally. I'd love to see more people using it as a form of healing! Have any of you had experiences where music has been a form of therapy? Please tell me your story, I'd love to start a conversation about it.","I've been involved with music therapy for years. Playing music for elders with Alzheimer's is very beneficial. I always ask what years they were in  high school and try to play something they remember. Sun Ra was very involved with music therapy. He liked to tell the story about when he was playing piano for a group of elderly people at a retirement home. A woman who was in a wheelchair and hadn't spoken or walked for a decade got out of her chair, walked on her own power across the room and stood over him as he played the piano. Finally she said in a loud, powerful voice: ""YOU CALL THAT MUSIC?""",55
fa4p53,"I made a big mistake recently. I was getting frustrated with my listening patterns. First I had a favorites playlist that had a little of everything, but then I realized I was skipping 80% of the songs most of the time. So I started dividing my music into smaller categories. But then I found I was only listening to 3 or 4 playlists consistently and I was missing a bunch of great music that was in other playlists.  Recently I decided to just dump everything into one playlist and start over sorting it from scratch. By the time everything was dumped in this one playlist it was over 12k songs. Now I'm overwhelmed and can't get to sorting them. I don't know if I should try to sort by genre or mood or what.  How do you sort your music? Edit: I found out it's pretty easy to restore deleted playlists, so they aren't all gone. Still curious about what people have found is their favorite way to sort music. I kinda wish there was a tool that would take all of my music and sort it into mood or genre for me and I could make playlists from that","Your post gives me anxiety I primarily listen to albums. I save an album if I like it, basically. However I have a few playlists that are important in my rotation: * I have a running ""musical diary."" This is a series of playlists of 5 ""significant' songs each month for the past 11 years, with no repeats.  They are divided into playlists that roughly correspond with seasons (in university they corresponded moreso to semesters). These playlists are maybe my most prized sentimental ""possession."" * I have tightly curated playlists as representative samples of my end-of-year favourites from the past couple years, made specifically to share with friends. * I have an a m b i e n t ~~ largely instrumental playlist for being productive because I can't listen to vocals/lyrics when I'm trying to study or do work. * I've been working on a long nostalgic playlist called ""Ghosts of summer past."" I got the idea one balmy evening last August, but then got too busy to flesh out the idea as well as I wanted to. My plan is to put some work into it next summer, and maybe again share it with friends. * A small party/drinking with friends/going out/having guests over playlist, and a second one that is more appropriate at bigger parties and drunker people * A playlist of old dramatic 90s slow jams from people like Mariah Carey and Usher and Toni Braxton because sometimes I feel like being melodramatic and I'd just like this all in one place please. * My new year's resolution was to consume more Canadian art/media/culture, so I have a running playlist of my favourite new discoveries. * A large, growing playlist of mostly upbeat songs that I know my partner and I both like, so I can throw it on easily in the background when we drive or cook or clean or something",210

feigjg,"I just realized how much I used to enjoy Muse. With their new material, I really forgot what a great band they used to be. Just listening through Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and such rn (anything pre 2nd law), they were GREAT at writing these extra distorted bass heavy rock songs. Plug In Baby, Citizen Erased, Uno, Hysteria, Uprising... I can go on and on. Why did they have to do those albums after Resistance? Did they have to?","I really like early Muse, but it doesn't really surprise me to see them go down this disappointing path. They had a great sound and could really play, but in terms of songwriting, something's always rung a bit hollow.

fflaoz,"In literature for example, if you were to say that Joyce or Tolstoy are better authors than let's say John Green, very few people would go crazy. Many would agree and others maybe would say they're not comparable or whatever, but very few people would outrage about such statement. But if we're talking about music, dare to say that Mahler's 3rd Symphony or Miles Davis A Kind of Blue are better than Despacito or such other pop hit and you will get a lot of people angry, yelling that you're an elitist and so forth. Why is this? By the way, I'm not saying elitism is good, let anyone listen to whatever they like. I'm just trying to understand why the difference in different art forms.","I'm not sure I really agree with your premises, to be honest. I'm sure there are lots of people who will argue till they're blue in the face that Harry Potter is better than Anna Karenina, for instance. I suspect popular v good arguments are less prominent in literature because it is a less widely consumed art form. Having a greater proportion of - to pick a potentially loaded term - ""aficionados"" among the consumers of an art form likely means less populism in discourse. Music is much more widely consumed than literature. But compare instead with film. Imagine opening a discussion on what's better out of Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and, I dunno, whatever Marvel movie people think is the best. I'm guessing Citizen Kane advocates would get a lot of accusations of elitism thrown their way. There's probably also something about an art form springing from a popular base. ""Music"" is very broad, but certainly popular music originated as an easily consumed, easily accessible thing. Over 20 or 30 years it got a lot more serious, or at least some of it did - but you can still make the case the ""perfect pop"" or whatever is the highest form of popular music. So you're attempting to quantify popularity as artistic merit - not easy to do. Novels weren't as accessible in their early days so literature effectively became an art form for the educated, wealthier ""elite"". It then cascaded down to a more popular base over many years.",216
fgbvrm,First let me say I don‚Äôt have an issue with songs that swear a lot but I think there‚Äôs a big difference in the weight of the word when used sparingly. A great example is John Lennon‚Äôs working class hero which uses fucking just 2 times such as ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre still fucking peasants as far as I can see‚Äù. He only uses the word twice and as such when he does there‚Äôs more impact and raw emotion on its use. A less known example that perfectly shows off what i mean is Joel‚Äôs [Laura](https://youtu.be/ALp9rfnPJ8c) which has an emotion backed line ‚Äúhere I am feeling like a fucking fool‚Äù about an abusive and manipulative relationship. In this context the use of the word helps to emphasize the singers feeling more than any other word would and if he used it repeatedly it wouldn‚Äôt have the same impact. Edit- let me add cause I see some comments on this and totally agree. When songs censor a word it might as well ruin the song. Radio Edits are shit half the time because they either bleep it which is god awful or they just cut the sound which feels weird. Boy named sue says bitch one time.

fkbsty,"Let me explain, as I'm probably not using the right term (if there is one). I sat down today and listened to billy woods/kenny segals ""Hiding Places"" record, a 2019 hiphop album with left field production and aggressive rhymes (to oversimplify). I enjoyed it greatly.  Later on, I stumbled across the song ""Bubbles Buried In This Jungle"" by Death Grips. I really liked it, which was odd because I've listened to Death Grips before (in fact, I'm pretty sure I listened to the last two records by them when they first dropped) but didn't like them at all. But for some reason this song clicked with me, and I went on a Death Grips binge and found that I liked a lot of it (even the stuff I previously dismissed). I then noticed that in Spotify's ""Fans Also Like"" sidebar for DG... was billy woods. So my maybe dumb question is, do you think that by first listening to the billy woods project (which is WAY tamer than DG) I was somehow ""primed"" to stomach and even enjoy Death Grips later?","Sure.

Even some melodic noise exists that juxtaposes the inherently harsh nature of the genre with an actual Melody Non's  embers encapsulates this perfectly https://youtu.be/DKHH-vXxSzo And even some rhythmic noise such as NAH's Hell gate allows for what should be an unpleasant industrial sound  to become catchy, and irresistible https://youtu.be/ATUIg6D7Dxw Overall I believe that harsh noise has been unfairly written off as a pretentious non musical subgenre not worthy of analysis, however it can open one's mind to the edge of what ""music"" can even be, even if most people would never consider it so.","The best way in which I can describe why I like noise is that it feels like brushing my brain. Like, remove all that smelly shit in the the creases like pieces of meat between your teeth. Take your brain out of that algae-ridden aquarium of thoughts, worries and confusion and blast it with the pressure washer.",89
fnkv4y,"For many years I've had Steely Dan's *Aja* on my MP3 player that I frequently have on shuffle. I just now looked at the album's track order and now that I've listened to the individual tracks so many times outside of the context of the album, the actual tracklisting feels all wrong. ""Aja"" just doesn't feel like a second track, it's the type of song that feels like it should be at the end or second to the end. And what is actually at the end? ""Josie"", one of the album's most celebratory and infectious songs that feels like an obvious A-side. I'm not claiming I know better than Steely Dan but, he guys, come on. This makes me wonder if there are other albums that are great but the track order doesn't help elevate the constituent parts.

fo428s,"While I am not saying they haven't got plenty of fans and don't get respect, I still feel the great British invasion band, The Kinks, don't get the credit they deserve. They had a string of albums starting with Face to Face (1966) that are just absolutely essential; they are witty, clever, catchy, musically interesting, adventurous and just a fantastic listen. I think these albums are some of the most consistent of the entire 60s, both thematically and in terms of the quality throughout.  They were incredibly innovative, experimenting with Indian sounds before even The Beatles on See my Friends, creating some of the heaviest tracks pre-1966 with You Really Got Me and All Day and All of the Night, early pioneers of the concept album, and using more satirical lyrics when a lot of the other bands of the day were still singing about love, etc.  &#x200B; Yeah this is a bit of a ramble but let's give The Kinks some love, they are brilliant.","They may have been a little too quirky and ""English"" for America, plus I remember reading a drugs charge stopped them touring the US in the 60s which didn't help. But yes, top band right from early on in the decade.",120
for8g4,"Based on an unscientific survey, I've found that English-language band/ensemble names at least have gone through three phases: 1) ""______ and His Orchestra"" or ""the ______ Quintet"" type of names. These originate in classical music but were adopted by many jazz, swing, and traditional pop groups, with the former format either centering around the name of the singer or around the bandleader. 2) ""The ______"" with a plural noun and sometimes a number or adjective (for instance, the Five Satins or the Everly Brothers). This was the main format in the early wave of rock and roll and R&B, as well as in some small traditional pop vocal groups that would influence or evolve into doo-wop (The Ink Spots and the Chordettes are probably the most recognizable to Millennial and Generation Z listeners). Sometimes you'd see a hybrid with the first type, for instance ""Bill Haley and his Comets"" and ""Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers."" This convention is still used to some extent, for instance the Jonas Brothers and the Eagles. 3) The abstract band name (for instance, Jefferson Airplane or Bathory). I don't know if this was causal, but this seems to have become popular during the emergence of psychedelic rock and some British Invasion acts also use such a naming convention. There are also some borderline cases (for instance, The Family Dog or The Who) that overlap with type two. A number of bands actually changed their names in the 1960s and 1970s (The Parliaments, a doo-wop group, became the funk band Parliament, and the Dutch group The Golden Earrings became Golden Earring).  This last trend is fascinating as I don't know a) why ""The ____"" bands were so dominant in the 1950s and early 1960s and b) where the idea of using abstract noun phrases or words came from.","The shift from the first convention to the second one, I think, can be ascribed to bands becoming smaller and staying together longer. It really didn't matter that much if Glen Miller's 3rd saxophonist moved to another country and they had to get a new one. But a tighter, leaner rock'n'roll sound started to depend on skill of an individual backing member very much: for example, the sound of Elvis best songs is defined in large part by Scotty Moore (and other band members, of course). And you certainly can't swap out any of The Beatles for another skilled musician. The second shift, I can only guess, but I think it happened just because young musicians were tired of ""simple"" band names their predecessors used and wanted to parody them, or just be different.",142
fquvzo,"I love Talking Heads. They were essential during my teenage years and I return to them plenty as an adult. Omnivorous in their influences, shameless in their pursuit of hitting the listener's pleasure button: the music hardly ever lets up. But perhaps more important was David Byrne's persona. A geek who wanted to stay a geek but also didn't want to be alienated from those around him... Even in my mid-twenties, I relate. Their masterpiece is obviously Remain in Light. It was both their most musically ambitious and philosophically complete record, and probably in my top 10 albums of all time. More Songs About Buildings and Food and Fear of Music are idiosyncratic post-punk works of genius, and probably the band at their most Taking Heads-y, if you catch my drift. Their post-Remain in Light albums are good, but not as consistent as their early work- they're heavily reliant on their incredible singles (""This Must be the Place"", ""(Nothing but) Flowers"", ""Road to Nowhere"", etc.). And then there's Talking Heads 77. This album dropped in one of the best years for rock music ever. Marquee Moon, Never Mind the Bollocks, Rocket to Russia, The Clash, Rumours... It's understandable that it was slightly overlooked. In the Heads' own discography it's overshadowed by Remain in Light. Hell, of all their albums it's the one that sounds least Talking Heads-y: they've not quite found their sound and Byrne isn't yet at his geeky peak. But damn it, I LOVE this album. It's giddiness personified; it's tightly wound and ridiculous; it's a quartet taking their limited resources and hurling them hard as they can at the microphone. There's a purity to its wild wackiness that I can't resist or find elsewhere. Byrne's most accomplished vocal performances come later in his career, but nowhere will you find him quite so cracked or energetic. Every time I hear ""Pulled Up"" or ""Uh-oh, Love has Come to Town"" I get completely lost in his enthusiasm. ""Psycho Killer"" is just another excuse to unleash his raw eccentricity. The album's most chilled track, ""First Week/Last Week"", is interspersed by some bizarre scatting that makes me grin ear to ear. Simply put, this album is fun, a quality that usually doesn't carry much weight in the ""classic albums"" debate. But if I ever need a shot of adrenaline, I know where to go. How do you guys feel about '77? Is there a Heads album that you feel doesn't get enough love? A penny for your thoughts!","I would rank their first four albums as ‚Äò77 and More Songs being about the same level, with 77 having ‚Äúbetter songs‚Äù but More Songs possibly being the ‚Äúbetter album.‚Äù I would put Fear of Music and Remain in Light just above those two, with both being conceptually great and with brilliant production from Eno. However I think in a lot of ways *the* Talking Heads album for me would have to be The Name of This Band. With the expanded edition it covers almost all of their songs from their first four albums, and they are all performed with an impeccable energy.",47

fte0lj,"So the other day I rewatched Melon's review of Come Over When You're Sober by Lil Peep.

Somewhere in between?","This is maybe a boring answer but I think in the age of the internet almost everything gets a rose colored reexamination at some point.

fu6eji,"I'm sure this thread has been posted before, but I find it an interesting thing that the idea something can appeal to someone a lot more than the actual thing itself. One example for me is the Welsh band the **Manic Street Preachers**. I've heard of them in elementary school but would only hear their music in high school. I listened to their album ""*Gold Against the Soul*"" and liked a few tracks such as ""*Roses in the Hospital*"" or ""*La Tristesse Durera*"", but nothing beyond that. I was aware of the band's cult status and the whole Richey Edwards disappearance thing but I grew out of my initial interest in the band. Now, years later, I'm revisiting their tracks and I've listened to the ""*Holy Bible*"" and I really love the entire concept of the band. The lyrics are some of the best ever and the things they stand for are very significant. Also, Richey and Nicky Wire were iconic songwriters and personas in their heyday. However, as much as I adore their ideas and respect them and their talents, I still can't get into their music and it's based on how they sound. No doubt, James Dean Bradfield is a very talented musician - can sing very well, has an identity on the microphone that is easy to pick out when you hear it and is a really good guitar player. All that being said, his voice is very irksome to listen to and that's why I might be having trouble with their music. I'm thinking of trying some of their stuff again like their first record ""*Generation Terrorists""* (I love the titles of their stuff, another favorite is ""*Journal for Plague Lovers""*), or revisiting the other albums I've heard.

fum55f,"I know that some popular genres like Country music use the violin and that there's plenty of Classical music that uses the guitar, mostly by Spanish composers since it's much more popular and iconic in Spain than in the rest of Europe. But talking in general, most genres of Popular music use the guitar or the piano as the main instrument and also guitar is the most popular choice to play music when gathering with a bunch of friends around a campfire or at home. And most mainstream Classical music uses violins as a standard part of the orchestra and also there are lots and lots of iconic violin concertos, sonatas, partitas, etc. The same is not true for the guitar, it's usually not standard in the orchestra and there are way less compositions for solo guitar. Why do you think this is? Is it because violin is harder to play and therefore less popular? I think the violin is better at creating a unified sound when playing together in an orchestra than the guitar would be. I don't think 20 guitars playing together would sound as melodical as 20 violins, so this could be a reason. But why is the violin not more common in popular genres or for playing songs in gatherings in general?  I think the piano is probably the most popular instrument since it has been popular for centuries, much more if we count the harpsichord as an antecedent, and it's still fairly popular today.","Instruments like piano and guitar are popular because they work well for playing chords.  I can sit alone with a guitar or piano and work out the full harmony for a song, where a violin favors being part of a larger whole like an orchestra or string quartet.

fw0rw7,"EDIT: '20 Feet From Stardom'... I'm a well meaning idiot.  So, I just watched this documentary for maybe the 4th time last night. It's streaming on Netflix, if anyone is interested. It does such a fantastic job capturing the unique contribution backup singers (black women in particular) have made throughout pop music's history. It dives into a range of topics, including what occurred during the 60s, when less attractive, but incredibly talented, singers were getting screwed over by the likes of Phil Spector, who simply stamped other girl group's names to some of the best and most recognizable recordings of the decade. But it also extends into the modern era, interviewing a few 'next level' singers who are considering making the jump to solo stardom, or have (fascinatingly) never felt the urge to take that route. What I love about this documentary is that it touches on so many relevant social and cultural issues, but it mostly does so, not by making overtly political arguments, but by simply telling these womens' stories. The documentary also does a great job giving you a sense why black singers first became a known commodity in the industry and were able to bring a new sense of 'soul' that the Andrew Sisters, et al, could not. Unsurprisingly, it has everything to do with gospel music, but the documentary illustrates this point quite well. Finally, if you haven't seen this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChONufP0FEs) showing Merry Clayton and Mick Jagger recounting Merry's legendary vocal performance on 'Gimme Shelter'... I'll venture it'll be the most entertaining 3 minutes of entertainment you'll watch today. They showcase an isolated track of her vocals and I'm telling ya... it'll give you chills.

fwk88g,"Personal chapeau: my top 3 bands are The Strokes, Tool and The Beatles to have an idea about me. I love rock music. But never been a fan of Muse for some reason. Just never got into them. Just one of those things. Regardless, they are a massive band, so nothing but respect.  In 2017, I saw Muse at Paleo Festival in Nyon, Switzerland, and what really caught my attention was their bassist, Chris Wolstenholme. Funky as basslines! (Albeit I know nothing about bass guitar techniques nor am i too familiar with the bass guitar scene, surprising for a Tool fan I know).

fxkr0o,"She's had great success in film and music, even getting to perform at the Super Bowl this year with Shakira. She's been a fixture in pop culture for over 20 years now. Despite being universally known as not a good singer (but one hell of a performer, you can't deny her that), she's had a fair amount of hits and surprisingly remains quite popular still to this day (thanks to her Vegas residency and On the Floor being a mega smash & reviving her singing career; over 14 million streams on Spotify this month alone which is higher than Madonna). But what's especially puzzling is how she's been able to get away with having so many ghost singers singing most of her hits and NEVER facing any scrutiny or scandal when it would have killed any other artists career time and time so shamelessly. It's actually quite impressive. People like Paula Abdul and even Britney Spears for example were constantly accused and ragged on yet Jennifer Lopez always seemed to be left unscathed when out of those 2, it's actually been proven time and time again that she doesn't sing a lot of her own songs. In fact, she's been known for taking demos and keeping the singers in her songs and not crediting them. This video shows tons of examples and it's quite eye opening & shocking how little of her own songs she's actually sung in her career (for example, on one of her #1 hits ""All I Have"" she sings only 5% of her own song... how did she not get slammed/destroyed by the media for this?): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOEmCERi21U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOEmCERi21U) How has she been able to get away with this for her entire career?","I know we love accusing every new pop artist of being an industry plant these days, but in the case of Jennifer Lopez it was the truth.

And hey, Jennifer Lopez was Selena, so the general public thought that maybe she *can* sing.

fxqeao,"Lately, I feel like there has been this underlying schism in a lot of discussion surrounding the *how* of discovering and listening to music. Whenever a question concerning organizing one's music listening, there is a noticeable resentment against the very idea of finding and listening to music in any systematic way. I've seen people get frustrated by this, lamenting the downfall of this subreddit and threatening to leave for good, so maybe it's time to address this directly. Heavily simplified, there seem to be two major viewpoints on this: the **hedonistic viewpoint** (or 'organic viewpoint', if the connotation of hedonism is too negative) rejects the idea of organizing the act of listening to music, instead suggesting an organic approach of listening to the thing that feels right. The **systematic viewpoint** defends a more organized approach and considers essential lists, guides and flowcharts a useful tool to get into music or a genre. From what I can see, these are some of the major arguments: **Hedonistic listening** * **Music should be self-fulfilling and approached organically**: It is rejected to impose a system on the act of music listening, since such a systematic approach is detrimental to the direct and emotional connection that is inherent to music. Instead, one should listen to what one feels like in the current situation. * **Rejection of the /mu/pitchfork/indieheads canon**: A lot of the resentment isn't necessarily directed at lists and guides *per se*, but rather at the few lists that usually are being used, namely the ones by Pitchfork, r/indieheads, /mu and Fantano. The fear is that in an attempt to ""get to know"" music, one basically listens to a specific cannon and the listener becomes just another indiehead or /mutant, leading to a general homogenization of music tastes on the internet. * **The Joy of Discovery**: We all know the thrill of finding a band and falling in love with it. Or dusting up an album in a record store/your parents' basement/on youtube that you never saw anyoone mention. Lists can't provide this deep and intrinsic connection to music you discovered yourself. Instead you just try to connect to music, that everyone else apparently likes. Which is fine if you manage, but sucks if you can‚Äôt get into a ""classic"" and wonder if something is wrong with you or start throwing around the word ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù. **Systematic listening** * **Lists and guides are useful tools to get into music and genre:** Approaching music or a new genre can be a daunting task, leading to the paradox of choice, i.e. the sheer amount of possibility crippling the task. Lists and guides can counter this by providing an overview and help get an understanding of the conventions and deviations of a genre. * **The desire to know music history**: Knowing the past helps understanding the present. Maybe best summarized by u/wildistherewind: ""Nobody became an English Lit major reading their favorite book over and over again, did they?"" * **Risk reduction**: There is an endless amount of music, more than anyone could ever hope to listen to. So, instead of taking one‚Äôs chances and listening to a lot of mediocre and outright bad music, why not listen to the music that has proven to be decent? * **Listening to music ‚Äúorganically‚Äù poses the risk of becoming a slave of one‚Äôs past or algorithms**: It is unproven common wisdom that one‚Äôs taste in music is cemented by the age of 27 and remains largely unchanged for the rest of one‚Äôs life. Similarly, just turning on spotify is nothing more than a highly personalized radio station. The passivity of this paired with the ‚Äúif you like X you will like Y, with X basically = Y‚Äù logic of algorithms threatens one‚Äôs autonomy and the possibility of having truly new experiences. I hope, I did the two positions justice. The reason I already listed the major arguments is, that I didn‚Äôt want the discussion be just about repeating them, instead turning towards the questions at its core:  * Are the two viewpoints mutually exclusive? * Is there a ""wrong"" way of discovering and listening to music? * Does it simply depend on the personal assessment of the currently predominant way of music discovery and consumption? * ""consumption"", ""task"", ""(check-)list"", ""organizing"", ""backlog"": Is the whole thing just a ""linguistic confusion"", i.e. a dispute over the rhetoric of listening of music? * Does the simple answer ""to each his\_her own"" solve the aporia?","This is a great post, OP. I'm glad we are tackling this discussion head on because it does creep its way into other threads fairly often. I don't think there is a binary way to listen to music and I don't think (or I don't hope) that someone exclusively and fiercely is on one side of the hedonistic / systematic divide. Of course I'm going to follow my instinct on some selections. Sometimes it's educated (I like the label, I like a producer) and sometimes it isn't (I like the artwork). Also, I think lists are important as an introduction to things I don't know about. I don't really like the 1001 Albums list but if I wanted to know which Frank Sinatra album to listen to, I'd defer to them because they know better than I do. I peruse lists constantly and occasionally, once out of every ten or fifteen lists, something I didn't know will catch my eye and will get added to my playlist. Lists don't have to be a be-all end-all, they can just be another form of information a person can choose to investigate or not. When I was in my 20s trying to learn as much as I could about music, I had to buy a lot of books. I found Allmusic guides helpful in explaining artists and releases. Obviously, at that time risk mitigation meant not paying $15 for a CD you don't like. Now risk mitigation means not wasting five minutes on a song that isn't great. When I think back, would I be the person who buys into the 1001 Albums guide? Probably. Because I didn't know what I wanted but I knew I wanted something *more*.",47
fyjgzs,"#And yes, I'm aware this one's going to be controversial. In fact, if you had told me five years ago that I would be writing this, I wouldn't believe you.  But here I am.  Over the past few months, my opinion on tribute bands has turned completely upside down, and I hope by laying out the reasons why, you might understand see what I mean. So let me lay out some things I've noticed one by one. --------------- #Observation 1 **Original artists tend to get bored easily** so being a human jukebox is literally like a nightmare for them.  And this problem is compounded since **they tend to disagree with their fans on what they should play.** Now you can't please everyone of course, but think about how Radiohead doesn't play Creep, how Zeppelin wanted to stop playing Stairway to Heaven in the mid-70s, or countless other examples.  Playing the same song over and over and over again gets old, and that leads to lackluster performances (at best) and total meltdowns and tour cancellations (at worst.) With a tribute band, this isn't a problem.  They are there to play what the fans want to hear, and that's what they want to play too. #Observation 2 **Whatever you believe about an artist is a carefully projected image, not who they actually are.** Musicians are fully rounded humans just like everyone else.  But that's not what you pay for. When you go to see Metallica, you want to feel like thumping your chest and banging your head.  You don't want to see a guy who just got bad news a few hours ago, so he's getting weepy and having somber emotions.  And vice versa.  When you see a laid-back performer it would be very disappointing if they were upset that day and deliver their lyrics all pissed off. You're buying an act. Sure, sometimes the line is thin.  But other times (KISS, David Bowie, Lady Gaga) the line is thick as a brick.  And if it's an act (it is) then other actors can play the role too. #Observation 3 **""You shouldn't meet your heroes.""** How many horror stories have you heard where some fan finally gets that autograph, only to find out the person they admired for so long, is suddenly all too human?  That takes all the fun out of it. #Observation 4 **In any other form of art, tinkering with that works is seen as annoying.** Look at Star Wars, for example.  In the 90s, Lucas started making edits with his ""special editions"" and then he did it again. And again. And again. And people hate it. But that's basically what you're asking for when you ask some throaty 70 year old man to get up on stage and scream some lyrics he wrote when he was 25.  It's not the same, not even close.  It's probably tuned down a step or two, the tempo might be sped up (so they can get it over with faster) or other such modification. It sucks! #Observation 5 **No, you can't beat the real thing at its prime...but ""prime"" probably isn't available anymore.** I'm not suggesting that seeing a Led Zeppelin tribute band could actually be better than seeing Led Zeppelin in 1971.  But that's not even an option, is it?  It's not like you can buy a ticket to fifty years ago and bring Bonham back to life. #Observation 6 **Tribute acts are cheaper.  Much cheaper.** Would you rather pay $25 for front row seats in a nice, intimate venue or $100 for so far away from the stage you'll wish you brought binoculars, and you might get rained on?  And by the way it took two hours to park because 20,000 people were trying to shove themselves into the same building. #Observation 7 **Tribute acts are still an emerging art form.** Elvis was one of the first global superstars.  And so he was one of the first to have impersonators.  Before tv, there wasn't really such a thing. But as time goes on, more and more musicians from the 50s, 60s, 70s etc. are retiring.  And so if some young person wants to know what it was like to see Elvis live, what are they supposed to do?  Watching old videos of someone is not the same experience, not even close. Yes, I'm aware people have made fun of tribute bands.  But people make fun of every artform, at first. #Observation 8 **Tribute acts and musicals...what's the difference?** * Some people get up on stage * They put on makeup and costumes to pretend to be other people * And then they sing songs for an hour or two. Am I describing a musical or a tribute act?  Because one of these is a respected artform and the other is laughed off like it's the last train stop for the failed artist. #Observation 8.5 **People only wear wigs when it matters.** Since I just brought up costumes and makeup I might as well comment on that, because it's a big turnoff for some people.  So here's what I'd say.  For certain tribute acts (like Michael Jackson) it's pretty essential to get the visual element correct.  An Michael Jackson tribute needs to be able to dance, have the right body type, and wear something that resembles the iconic suits he wore. But for others, like Pink Floyd for example...you won't see wigs there.  Every tribute act is different.  I've seen Bob Marley bands who wear wigs, I've seen others where they dress normal and focus on the music. #Observation 9 **Some writers are terrible performers.  Some people who are excellent performers can't write a song to save their life.** So why have we been asking artists to do both? In some ways, this goes all the way back to The Beatles, who were the first big band that could write *and* perform their own stuff. And that's the model the industry has stuck with for over 50 years now.  Every major star is expected to both write their own stuff and perform it as well **and it is common to see artists derided for having people help write their music.** Just take a look at any post about a big chart-topping artist and down in the comments you'll see someone link to the Wikipedia page and point out how it has five writers or whatever.  Who cares?  But for fifty years now, the industry (and the fans!) have been favoring writing so much more than performing, and live performances have suffered as a result. #Observation 10 **If you see a live show by a ""real"" band from the 80s or earlier, there's about a 0% chance you're seeing the people who actually recorded the songs.**  More likely you've got one or two or *maybe* three left and the rest are touring musicians. So...at what point does that become any more/less authentic than seeing a tribute act? #Observation 11 **Tribute acts are how some musicians make money, and they aren't hurting anyone.** It is so mean-spirited to pick on tribute acts.  It sucks to stumble across some Youtube video where the comments are talking about how much they liked the show, and the guy from the tribute act is feeling good about it too...then some bozo comes along and calls them inauthentic, or pointless, or whatever. What did they do to you?  These people work hard, they're having fun, and people enjoy it. #Observation 12 **In the age of DIY distributing and self-promotion, tribute acts are reaching a new level of excellence.** The internet has disrupted the music market in a lot of ways.  But one major benefit for tribute bands is that it has never been easier to show off what you can do, organize a tour, and get out there making money. It used to be so difficult.  Before Youtube, tribute acts were a hard sell because you never knew if they were any good.  Now you can take two minutes to watch their videos...it's that easy.  And as a tribute act, you can send venues those videos and that makes it much easier to book a show.  This leads to more shows, more tickets, more money and that means they can spend more hours working on it and investing in the act.  It's a feedback loop between the band and the fans that makes it better and better. Next thing you know you've got a great show. ---------------------------- So looking at it all together, I'm going to take a leap here and guess that we're going to see tribute acts get a lot bigger sometime in the next decade or so, as more and more on the classic hits bands retire. Personally, I'm looking forward to it.  I used to roll my eyes at tribute bands, but I think I had it wrong.  I get it now.","I've never seen Pink Floyd live, but I do enjoy Brit Floyd (more so than the Aussie tribute band). Over the years, PBS has shown both. These tribute bands do a great, sometimes exceptional job, in recreating the hits. Observations #10, reminds me of how a lot of bands like Blondie, Aerosmith and The Beach Boys, have deliberately dropped original band members (Frank Infante, Al Jardine and Joey Kramer, respectively) and replaced them with other musicians; which to me reeks of greed. That, I find troublesome. But what about holograms of dead artists like Whitney Houston? A lot of people are willing to pay good money, to go to these 'concerts'. Is this the wave of the future? Do you find that acceptable?",113
fzxp8w,"Don't get me wrong, I love Daft Punk, but I'm always kinda bummed when I discover that one of their bonafide hits is really just a great crate find with some added dance beats. And yes, sampling is, of course, a legitimate art form in its own right... but, for whatever reason, I always assumed there was much more unique craftsmanship that went into each of their songs, like Aphex Twin or The Chemical Brothers. Maybe that's my fault. Maybe most of you were already aware of these details. And it could certainly be argued that Daft Punk shouldn't be punished for choosing samples that are so particular, you might not even recognize that they're samples. However, the question that keeps popping up for me... at what point does a supposedly original song become a glorified remix? It sometimes seems that Daft Punk walks that line and I'm wondering if that should impact their legacy at all. Again, this isn't meant to be an overtly anti-Daft Punk post. Like I mentioned, I love their music and I'm a huge fan of crate digging DJs. I guess I'm just curious why these samples are rarely discussed and whether or not these observations have any influence on people's appreciation of the duo. Here are a few examples of times in which Daft Punk seemingly leaned so heavily on a particular sample, listeners might as well be celebrating whoever created the original rendition. [Cola Bottle Baby - Edwin Birdsong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiD39jo5Yo4) [Release The Beast - Breakwater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVfZAZdIUs) [Can You Imagine - Little Anthony & The Imperials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q72Y5uWnFPo) [Love You More - George Duke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEibygqqLZc) [Il Macquillage Lady - Sister Sledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSDT1eVxfIY)","I know this might rub people the wrong way, but ultimately, I don't have a problem with it because Daft Punk took a bunch of tracks that I never really would have wanted to listen to and turned them into something I really want to listen to. I'm not saying the originals are bad or anything, I just can't imagine myself listening to them over and over like I do with the DP versions. It isn't more complicated than that.",278
g07pjn,"I don't bloody like Coldplay. I usually try to avoid hating on artists, but I can't help but resent Chris Martin. He was born with incredible gifts: he has a superb ear for melody and an understanding of just when to strike the right chord to push the listener over the edge. Seems to be pretty talented as a band leader, too. And he squanders it all on songs that are (at the their best) unchallenging or (at their worst) banal. He seems completely uninvested in anything other than commercial success. True for plenty of artists, sure, but given he tries to exploit feelings of sentimentality to rake in his cash, I can't help but feel he is slightly more insipid. The term ""plastic soul"" springs to mind. I know I'm not using that phrase for its original meaning, but I'm sure you catch my drift. But then there was that one time in 2002 that Coldplay recorded one of the most beautiful songs of the 21st Century. It was one of the last tracks Martin wrote for their second album, added after he felt something was missing. Apparently, he had been listening to George Harrison's All Things Must Pass before he wrote it. Why does this Coldplay song hit me so much harder than anything else they wrote? Well, for starters, Martin's piano is much more percussive than his usual tinkle-tinkle: it thumps along heavy, contrasting the sentimentally of the chord sequence. This results in the emotions feeling weightier, more real- it offers a challenge that most Coldplay songs don't have. The melodies, as is always the case with this band, are grandiose and memetic. But for once they come attached with some powerful lyricism. No BS about the stars shining yellow or ticking clocks. Instead we get ""Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me"" and ""Running in circles... Chasing our tails"". Love is an ancient song writing topic, sure, and Martin has given it a shot plenty of times. But this feels like he actually WANTED to write a love song, rather than just ape a popular topic. Finally, we also get what seems like a completely sincere vocal performance. His howls during the songs coda sound pained and real; his voice really does seem to be breaking with emotion during the chorus. In so many other Coldplay songs his falsetto just seems like an exploitative trick-- In ""The Scientist"", they're an expression of his humanity. Seems like a ridiculous thing to post on this forum, but hey, we're in lockdown! Does anyone else feel this way about this song? Am I too harsh on Coldplay as a whole? A penny for your thoughts!","I like this post and I agree with you. I think The Scientist is a *superb* song (and not just because of all the heartbreak it got me through in high school.) I agree with pretty much all the reasons you laid out. The lyrics are truly excellent, one of those songs that you wouldn't add or remove a single word. Baring one's soul like this always runs the risk of coming off cheesy but I find Martin's lyrics incredibly moving and poignant here. I don't even have a line to quote, I think it's really all good. The concept of trying to approach love like a scientist, not understanding why the pieces don't fit, then finally conceding that the science does not ""speak as loud as your heart"" is extremely relatable and is stated in such an eloquent way that it helped me understand my own sorrows better. That to me is a love song right there. I quite agree that the music does the lyrics justice as well. The structure isn't anything too radical for Coldplay, taking basic chords and adding a few seemingly minor flourishes that somehow bring it to life: include a minor 7th in the first chord, end the progression on an inverted Fsus2 (which I will always hear as the Scientist chord), and throw a little hit of the C note in between the 2nd and 3rd chords that you'd swear in its seeming insignificance is actually crucial to the whole song. The Fsus2 flows very nicely back into the tonic Dm7, creating a satisfying cyclical feeling that doesn't get tiring. Nice chords in the bridge too, a nice bit of tension in there. It's one of those songs you play at the piano and think ""that's it, huh? why does it work so well though..."" Here is where I will disagree with you: I think Coldplay have a few songs on par with The Scientists. I'll throw out a few: - Don't Panic. Chris again with basic chords, tailored just right to invoke a unique and intriguing emotion. There's so much feeling just in that opening Fmaj7 chord with the hammer on, there's a quiet understated sense of mystery that builds and leads into a lazy, pensive chord progression that never quite feels at rest. The chorus riff wonderfully encapsulates the mysterious vibes of the song. What's it about? No idea. But, I do appreciate the optimism of ""we live in a beautiful world"", simple as it is.  - Fix You. I suspect for many this might go a *bit* far into seminental territory, bordering on cheesy, but I'm a cheesy romantic myself and I love it. While it's not a groundbreaking topic, I love the idea of a song about healing somebody *else's* emotional wounds, and one thing that has always struck me about these lyrics is how empathetic and unselfish they are. There's no hint of jealous love, or even of the narrator's desires at all. Just the most comforting words he can come up with to somebody in need who, he admits at the end of the day he can only ""try to fix"". The build up and crescendo of the song, as I mentioned, might border on tacky or dramatic for some people but god it gets me every time. I still to this day get chills when the electric guitar riff kicks in and the chorus starts singing.",124
g0osga,"Trip-hop is a music style that emerged from Bristol in the late 80s and early 90s. The genre was greatly influenced by Bristol's black community with funk, hip-hop, reggae, and dancehall roots. The Dug Out in Bristol was a club in which the music style was fostered by its leaders such as the Wild Bunch(Massive Attack) and Tricky. Trip-hop then spread throughout the international community in groups like Thievery Corporation.  I'm 16 and live in Colorado so I have very little actual knowledge of the culture surrounding the style, how big it got to be, and how it spread. Was anyone super into it in its heyday? What are your experiences with it? What do you know about the genre? What made it so appealing to so many? Where do you see it in music today? Some trip-hop artists(some are more downtempo): [Portishead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c417rIku6Iw), [Sneaker Pimps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnucqEU9C7s), [DJ Shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-HVgnOI3HY)(instrumental hip-hop, has some ties to genre), [Massive Attack](https://youtu.be/oWohPJHicFE), [Tricky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3R_3h6zQEs), [Morcheeba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--wy8QmLlM8), [Lamb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bwy2XSbk3Q), [Thievery Corporation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq0ESlJhvBM), [Bitter:Sweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16PDJlxuAWs), [Wax Tailor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEi9ZQrEjr8), [Terranova](https://youtu.be/2NXJtWYCsgI) Edit: and [Esthero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS8GMCus4gM)","I've been a big trip-hop fan since around 2000. I'm an American and was in high school at the time, so don't have much to say about the Bristol scene. At the time I got into the genre I was going to raves here and there. There would usually be a chill out area where you could rest and cool down (or come down as the case may be) where they'd be spinning this stuff.  I'm also a huge jazz fan so I've always liked the combo of jazz loops with funk, reggae melody, and slow beats. I know Portishead was big on sampling from old movie scores which defined their style. Massive Attack was a little deeper into the electronic sound and hip hop. I feel that trip-hop also tended to function as electonica's more experimental arm at the time it was popular. I think of all the musical styles of the 90s trip-hop has the most direct descendants today. I hear it a lot in artists like Glass Animals and Tame Impala. I think that the genre has inspired a lot of artists and producers as I feel I hear its influences in a lot of current pop and rap. I'm specifically thinking of Beyonce's ""Lemonade "" and artists like Kali Uchis but I know I've heard the sound elsewhere in today's music.",63
g1dv0h,"One of the things I see a lot here, and on any subreddit about art or media, is the discussion about separating art from the artist. I've read two posts about it here in the last week alone but one thing no one ever talks about is art which is directly tied to their negative attributes. Lou Reed, for example, came up in a ton of discussions. Maybe you can ignore his treatment of women when you're rocking out to Sweet Jane but Berlin pushes it right in your face. I read an interview once with his ex-girlfriend where she said that certain songs from that album are basically autobiographal of their abusive relationship. There are a ton of examples like this. Bowie talks about himself using Ashes to Ashes and The Thin White Duke is basically the personification of his cocaine fueled evils. Maybe you have other examples of confessional music or music that leans into problematic aspects of the musician. I'd love to hear them and any thoughts you have on the topic. I just thought its an interesting counterpoint to the whole ""separating art from the artist"" debate.","Kanye West is the perfect example of someone completely inseparable from his art. Especially the MBDTF era, which was driven by, and a response to his public perception. I have a proposition for you: remember the public outrage over the MTV VMA incident with Taylor Swift. [Jay Leno made Kanye apologize to his dead mother on live TV for his ‚Äúshameful‚Äù behavior.](https://youtu.be/CrHAb6ynStE) Lady Gaga cancelled a co-headlining world tour with Kanye. [Obama called him a jackass.](https://youtu.be/078BGtKNL1o) He then went into isolation in Japan/Rome for 2 years. No one had heard anything from him, and then one day a paparazzi caught him in New York. 2 days later he released ‚ÄúPower‚Äù. Listen to that song again in that context.",104
g2oq4y,"Hidden tracks are pretty much a thing of the past now, since most music has become digital. It's quite fascinating to me that back in the day, when CDs were still the most popular music format, bands and musicians were able to put a song on their album the listener would only hear when they forget to put their CD-player off. Kinda like a musical easter egg. Still, my question is: what was even the point of hidden tracks? Did bands hide them because they had little faith in those tracks, yet they didn't want to leave them off the album because they had put a lot of effort into them? That's honestly the only explanation I could give. Why do you think some bands would've hidden a track instead of keeping them on the official track list? ","The 90s were a pretty carefree time and I don't think artists really overthought hidden tracks. It's fun to do, if there is extra space on the CD, why not use it? It's possible that some hidden tracks are seen as lesser than but a lot of them seem to just be goofy or slightly self-serving (like 6 and a half minutes of feedback). Edit: a word.",156
g3be05,"I should preface this by saying I think this is a really great, borderline brilliant album and one that is extremely needed right now. However, this isn't really as much a discussion of the album as it is the mythical 10/10 rating from Pitchfork. This is the first time in a decade we've gotten a perfect Pitchfork score for an album, the last being Kanye West's ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"". To go back and forth about the deservedness of the score seems pedantic, as everyone will have different opinions (music *is* subjective after all), but I think the discussion on Pitchfork and their choice to give the 10/10 to THIS album is interesting. For a long time now it seems as if Pitchfork is chasing trends, poptimism being the biggest one. With giving an album like this a 10/10 ‚Äì a very human, visceral and home-made record, that while released by Epic, is very independent with a beloved indie artist like Apple at the helm ‚Äì is this Pitchfork trying to ""regain indie cred"" again? The current discourse around this album seems to be entirely about the Pitchfork review, and not around the album itself. These thoughts are mostly jumbled, I just wanted to start a discussion about this. The review for those that didn't see it: https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters/","Pitchfork 10's seem to come from albums that undergo a long period of hype living up to the hype. Their 10's are always artists that are highly established, usually with several 9's or better under their belt. It makes sense since Pitchfork scores try to reflect an artist's trajectory and not really the album itself. Anyhow as much as I'm surprised Pitchfork gave Apple the 10 (even though they recently reviewed two of her older albums and gave them 9+ and, even at the time, it felt like their 9.0 score was low due to the sexism the site had at the time) I'm not sure it means much. The thing is, the hip hop community (and, to a lesser extent, the metal community) love this sort of lavish praise bullshit.  Every Pitchfork and Fantano score that's good is jerked off as important and obviously right on HipHopHeads. Most other music circles aren't going to care. Is a Fiona Apple fan going to give a shit whether this album gets a 10 or 9 or 8? Likely not. After all, Pitchfork is just another contributor to the music industry bullshit complex. All that said, it makes me pine for the days when we had publications that were both a bit snooty and heaped a lot of praise more frequently. Pitchfork's reviews and scores often feel like they don't actually like music, just the scene (kind of like how Fantano reviews and scores feel like he doesn't like music, just how things sound and how it was produced and mixed). I miss Drowned In Sound, who'd give 3-5 10's a year. Were there really 3-5 10 worthy albums a year? I don't know because I don't do scoring shit. But I felt it kept up a higher level of enthusiasm. The people at Drowned in Sound and Tiny Mix Tapes (who also gave a lot of 5 dot reviews) made me feel more optimistic about music. I mean, it's great that Fiona Apple made The Only Perfect Album Within The Last Ten Years but in terms of scoring system, I would prefer more variance from Pitchfork. You know, like back in the old days before they were bought out by Conde Nast and didn't give good scores to shitty pop albums. Conde Nast just laid off 10% of their workforce. That probably means even fewer reviews to the little guys. With so many music publications going under and no touring for a long time, it's going to be bad for underground musicians to get any traction. So I'll save any praise I have for Pitchfork for the day when they aren't just peddling major label artists.",183
g532fm,"A lot of us have heard the cliffnotes version of The Beatles breakup, it goes something like this: * When The Beatles stopped touring, their manager Brian Epstein felt useless and stressed out.¬† He ended up overdosing of sleeping pills * In the aftermath of his death Paul stepped up to the leadership role, but he was a control freak so the others soon started to hate working with him * Yoko met John and used him to get into the studio sessions, and the awkwardness of her constant presence stifled everyone else's creativity * Meanwhile George got desperate to leave the group because he'd built up a massive backlog of material that the others wouldn't take seriously * John was also feeling stifled, and wanted to go off on his own *¬†All of these issues stacked on top of each other, and became so overwhelming that it was reaching a breaking point. * And so, with all this in mind, The Beatles entered the studio to record Abbey Road as their grand finale/goodbye album * Now broke up, and with no more band to hold them back, each member was free to express themselves more fully and so they each ascended to the next level as artists. This is the story as it's been told for ages now. And yet, almost everything you just read is false at a fundamental level: * Brian Epstein was *initially* troubled when The Beatles stopped touring, but he bounced back quickly and it's unlikely to have been on his mind when he died. * The other Beatles sometimes got tired of Paul's bossiness, but overall they valued his work ethic.¬† [They also felt ""hurt"" when he worked without them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Don%27t_We_Do_It_in_the_Road%3F#Lennon's_reaction) * It was actually John who insisted on having Yoko in the studio, not the other way around.¬† And it wasn't much of a hindrance anyway, for the first day or two it was annoying sure but they got over it. * [George approached Paul to talk about The Beatles in December 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break-up_of_the_Beatles#cite_ref-FOOTNOTERodriguez201043_127-0), *after* the release of All Things Must Pass (his hugely successful debut album.)¬† So clearly he got over the feeling of being held back. * John felt great relief in late 1969 when he debuted The Plastic Ono Band, but in 1970 he still talked about the problems in the band as a possible ""rebirth"" for The Beatles. * None of these issues were stacking on top of each other.¬† By 1970 each of these issues was dealt with one by one, and resolved one by one. * [We have recordings of The Beatles from after Abbey Road where The Beatles in private are discussing ""their next album""](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/11/the-beatles-break-up-mark-lewisohn-abbey-road-hornsey-road) * John, George and Ringo all released solo albums before Paul ""announced"" the breakup of the band.¬† None of The Beatles were discouraged from doing their own solo work. There's a lot of reasons the story is told so wrong. But basically what it boils down to is a mixture of marketing, emotions, and the media.¬† The media misunderstood what was happening in the moment, then the band members themselves twisted things with the¬†bitterness of the 70s, and finally The Beatles^TM as it exists today is actively trying to whitewash and simplify things, shifting blame away to third parties whenever possible - but also trying to build up the mythology of the band for marketing purposes. So what I hope to do today is cut through all the crap. By the time you're done reading this, you will understand the breakup of The Beatles. -------------------- First, **I will compare it to a divorce.**¬† This will help to understand the true timeline of what happened, and identity why/when things escalated and passed a point of no return. Second, **I will compare their careers before/after The Beatles** and the damage it did to their success as songwriters. Third, **I will compare The Beatles to other bands**, especially bands that managed to last longer than them, usually A LOT longer than them. ----------------------- #The breakup of The Beatles as a divorce...when does a marriage end? Well, there's a few options for how to answer that question, but let's look at all the things that The Beatles had already worked past by 1970: * Paul being too controlling may have been a problem in 1967, but The White Album shattered that way of working.¬† By the time of Abbey Road, The Beatles were on more equal footing than they'd ever been before. * Yoko, as noted earlier, was a temporary annoyance.¬† But it seems they absorbed her presence pretty quickly...all of The White Album, Let It Be and Abbey Road were recorded with her in the studio - some of their greatest songs. * At some point, George was feeling held back...but by 1970, things had changed.¬† George was very happy with how Here Comes the Sun and Something turned out, and John and Paul were very impressed too. * John was also feeling held back for awhile.¬† But with the Plastic Ono Band, he had another outlet and he talked about continuing work with both bands. So none of these things were what did it. And, sadly, you might have noticed that these were all the *artistic* reasons given for the breakup....and none of them were what split the band.¬† So that means, the band did not split for artistic/creative differences. The Beatles split for something far stupider than that. #So why did The Beatles get a divorce? They had a handle on everything...except Allen Klein. In early 1969, John Lennon met a man named Allen Klein and (impulsive as ever) Lennon hired him to be his manager a few hours later and just like that suddenly Lennon was convinced that Klein was 100% the perfect choice and wouldn't hear any alternatives. Well Paul had never met Klein before, so of course he was skeptical.¬† And after some investigation he (accurately) figured out that Klein was shady with money.¬† But Lennon wouldn't listen. Things came to a head with the release of the album Let It Be.¬† Long after the songs had been recorded, someone else had been hired to gloss up the production.¬† Miscommunications ensued and next thing everyone knew Klein was issuing an album that Paul did not approve of.¬† **This was really bad**, a business dispute over management had directly effected their art and Paul was pissed. And yet Paul hung around. He made a big show when his solo album came out to say it was all over, The Beatles were done.¬† But the truth is that Paul debated the divorce internally all through 1970. John's solo album came out.¬† Huge success.¬† George's solo album came out.¬† Huge success. And yet Paul hung around.¬† They all did. And in December 1970, George met with Paul in NYC to talk about The Beatles.¬† Whatever happened that day, they got into an argument and a few weeks later Paul sued to dissolve The Beatles.¬† The papers were served. #A marriage is over when the papers are served. Any other way of looking at it is too nebulous.¬† If a spouse cheats with another person (like a solo album) that might look bad...but some marriages recover from stuff like that, and grow stronger than ever.¬†¬† And of course we've all seen couples get in huge arguments and post about it on Facebook, ranting about how they can't stand each other and how they're getting a divorce.¬† But does that mean it's over?¬† Usually no.¬† Some couples argue like that, and then the next day it's like nothing happened.¬† The word ""divorce"" can be thrown around very loosely. And that's how we should view all public comments by The Beatles during 1970, essentially private arguments that erratically spilled over to the public in flashes of emotion, leading to false impressions and inaccuracies. The reality of 1970 is that, in private, things were still in a state of negotiation.¬† How much they were speaking to each other about it is debatable, but there's no doubt they were all debating it internally.¬† And we know this from the timeline of events: * John would not have talked about about The Beatles ""rebirth"" in 1970 if he had really left the band in 1969. * George and Paul would not have met in December 1970 unless they were both still open to being The Beatles. * But as soon as Paul pulled the trigger on his lawsuit, there's no doubt the band was done. Everything until that point was focused on how to keep things together.¬† Paul suing everyone was the moment when it turned from ""how do we stay together"" to ""how do we split apart."" The Beatles ended in December 1970. --------------------- #And how did that go for them? Well, we're lucky enough to live in a world of streaming services, which give an accurate count of how popular their songs have stayed over time.¬† There is no better metric for what songs are standing the test of time, and which are being forgotten.¬† And the before/after of The Beatles is stark. **All four of The Beatles had successful solo careers**, even Ringo still rakes in a respectable 700,000 listeners a month.¬† But The Beatles boast 22 million. Breaking it down song-by-song is even more revealing.  The *average* Beatles song has about 32 million streams on Spotify, they have over eighty¬†songs that exceed that amount.¬† Mind-blowing.¬† But for their solo careers only nine songs reach that 32 million mark. **All four of The Beatles had successful solo careers.** I'm saying that twice so no one misunderstands me.¬† John, Paul, George and Ringo all had #1 singles and #1 albums during the 70s.¬† No one is denying that...but it's also in the past. I'm looking at how successful their solo careers are in the context of ongoing culture.¬† From that perspective, something clearly went wrong. #So what went wrong? Well, the big thing is that they lost the immediate feedback of working together: * You know how George sometimes had weird lyrics that sometimes felt like unfinished placeholders?¬† [John and Paul both would have helped him with that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLM78R76sI) * You know how John took a five-year hiatus from recording during what easily could have been his artistic peak?¬† [That never would have happened with Paul's insatiable work ethic pushing him forward.](https://youtu.be/AIp8ElF8kjo?t=13) * You know how Paul went off the deep end of nursery rhymes and endless pastiches of every person he ever heard?¬† [John was good at calling him out on that stuff, and giving it some edge too.](https://youtu.be/gBP1JLrT56Q?t=118) * And you know how Ringo was...way, wayyyy overexposed?¬† If the band had stayed together, he would have stuck to one or two songs an album - where he works best.¬† He's supposed to be the secret weapon, not the main attraction. Speaking generally, of course. And yet, even apart, The Beatles still influenced each other very deeply throughout their solo careers.¬† How Do You Sleep, Too Many People, Silly Love Songs, Wah-Wah and about a dozen other songs were aimed directly at each other - some of their best work actually.¬† And then there's stuff like Coming Up, which Lennon cites as his reason for coming out of retirement. It's just that this effect was subtle compared to how it would have been if they were still working in the same studio. The other big thing is The Beatles brand.¬† John, Paul, George and Ringo are all big brands on their own but nothing beats The Beatles.¬† Anything released under that name instantly gets a lot more exposure, which helps it stay relevant. --------------------- #And what exactly was it about The Beatles that made it ""necessary"" for them to break up? Where the cliffnotes version really falls apart is when you look at other bands. The Beatles were the first big band.¬† So at that time no one knew yet what a long band career looked like, for all they knew it was all a fad, that breakups were inevitable, and that all these musicians would retire by 30.  But we have sixty years of history now to look back and compare them to other bands. And wow was that initial analysis wrong. If you look at history, The Beatles were ridiculously short-lived for a popular band.¬† Just seven years, and probably far from peaking...ffs **George was 27 when they split** but from reading articles about the breakup you'd swear he was forty and had been downtrodden by John and Paul for the past decade.¬† It's laughable.¬† Now look at today.  Their contemporaries, like the Rolling Stones or The Who, had bigger personal disputes and yet they were all successful into the 80s. Looking at history, it usually takes death to ruin a band like The Beatles.¬† And statistically it looks like most pop musicians peak around 33 to 36 years old.  Abbey Road was recorded when they were all 30 or younger. #""But it's a good thing they ended at a peak with Abbey Road"" You see people say this all the time, but it's just bizarre. What are you talking about?¬† First off you're assuming the quality would drop, even though *on their own* they were still writing stuff like Maybe I'm Amazed, Give Me Love, and #9 Dream.¬† But let's look at the bigger picture here...What band in human history has ever had their legacy hurt by their later career? Seriously.¬† The same thing always happens - future generations always end up focusing on that hot streak of great albums and ignoring everything else: * Is ""the legacy"" of Led Zeppelin hurting because of Coda? * Is ""the legacy"" of Pink Floyd in shambles because they kept recording stuff after The Wall? * Does anybody care at all that Fleetwood Mac or The Beach Boys recorded albums in the 90s? Of course not.¬† These bands are all considered among the greatest of all time, and no one cares about the bad stuff they did.  Songwriters are judged solely by their best material. #The Beatles had a way wider range than people realize Often when I see people talking about the breakup, they say something like how George's spirituality or John's politics were outgrowing the band and it wouldn't fit what people would expect to hear from them. To debunk that utterly, [here's the chorus of a Beatles song:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZnm_s3wZeo) > Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be > The way things are going, they're gonna crucify me That's about as aggressively antagonistic as lyrics can get, and that was The Beatles. And it wasn't some B-side or deep album cut.¬† That was the chorus to the A-Side of a single, the biggest stage they could give to the song.¬† As for production, don't make me laugh.¬† There's not one song any Beatle released after 1970 that's impossible to imagine being on The White Album. And if that's still not enough to convince you, don't forget... #The Beatles were already recording solo albums before the breakup I'll finish off the comparisons to other bands by talking about Radiohead. **If you applied the mentality people have about The Beatles breakup to most other bands, it would be ""necessary"" for those bands to break up too.**¬† For example, how is it that every member of Radiohead has managed to have a mildly successful solo career and yet Radiohead is still going?  Impossible! /s The truth is that nothing was stopping The Beatles from operating that way artistically.¬† They all had other outlets for their weirder stuff (including ghost writing for other artists!) and that was totally fine. ------------------ #The cliffnotes version for how the band broke up is so far away from the truth. It's easy to see why Lennon said he wanted ""a divorce"" at the end of 1969.¬† The Beatles were beleaguered by all sorts of problems. But so is every band. And so were The Beatles before then.¬† They had had problems from the beginning (for example, they hated touring.)¬† But problems come and go. Breaking up The Beatles was a huge mistake - even without streaming data, on some level it's obvious that their solo material doesn't quite reach the level of when they worked together. But why look at data when you can just ask them about it.  You can see the regret on Paul's face sometimes when he talks about his past, and you could see that with John and George too.¬† No one really wanted it to happen, except on those 1% of days when they were in a bad mood, and by 1980 they all surely knew they had made a mistake.¬† Even on those days where they had a #1 album or a hugely successful tour, they still knew something was missing, that it could be more. But everyone involved (including the company that owns their music) have music to sell from those solo careers.¬† In other words, marketing.¬† And in that context the only way to market the breakup is to put on a smile and say that it was a good decision. * That's why we hear that it wasn't about money....it was ""creative differences"" * That's why we hear it set them free and that they really peaked after the breakup. * That's why the cliffnotes version tells us The Beatles knew Abbey Road would be their final album as they headed into the studio in February 1969, when in reality they were still trying to find a way to make it work over 18 months later. The company is protecting the money, and Paul is protecting his pride.  John and George used to do the same. #The truth The Beatles broke up because they didn't agree on Allen Klein as their manager, and even then the issue only escalated because of rash decisions and emotional outbursts that everyone would later regret. * John thought Paul would change his mind about Klein if he waited long enough. * Paul sued everyone because he felt he had tried everything and there was nothing else he could do to free himself from Klein. * And even on their angriest day neither John, George nor Ringo would never have traded Allen Klein for Paul McCartney, not in a million years. And isn't that sad?¬† We are led to believe it was because of art, but really it was because of stupid business decisions. ------------------- #Why I wrote this post There's a lot to learn from what happened to The Beatles, but not if we lie about it. I think a lot of people have bought into the lies and that that it hurts them creatively...for example, it's a dirty secret of songwriting that **we're often at our best when we're bouncing ideas off each other.**¬† But the cliffnotes version (lie) of The Beatles breakup teaches people the opposite lesson - that somehow...by losing valuable collaborators you will become *better* (?)...that somehow becoming a solo artist is like ascending into a final form. The cliffnotes version (lie) also tries to paint it all as an inevitability, but that's not true either. **We decide our priorities, they are not decided for us.** For example, Paul knew Allen Klein was shady, yes, but Paul was also a millionaire already and Klein couldn't touch that.¬† As manager, Klein could only get his hands on future earnings.¬† So Paul *could* have chosen to go down with the ship, he would have gotten ripped off yes, but The Beatles would have got ripped off *together* and in the end all four of them would have written better music. Instead he abandoned his best friends to their fate and floundered around for a few years, occasionally releasing [half-finished songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE-53NCcpDw) and eventually surrounding himself with a bunch of yes-men session musicians. This was not an inevitability, Paul was not trapped.¬† He made a choice. So did John.¬† John though Allen Klein could make him more money...so he chose Allen Klein over Paul.¬† Paul knew Klein would rip them off...so he chose more money over having John, George and Ringo as collaborators. Looking back, would either of them have made that decision?¬† I don't think so. But the cliffnotes version (lie) tries to paint the split as some sort of wise decision, some inevitable part of growing up.¬† When really it was just about money. The cliffnotes version (lie) also says that they went into Abbey Road knowing it would be their final album, and in that lie we lose a lesson about **the dangers of rash and emotional decision-making.**¬†The reality is that the disagreement about Allen Klein would have been resolved quickly and logically if Lennon had been mature about the issue, and listened to what Paul was trying to say, or maybe if George or Ringo looked into it too and realized how shady Klein was.  Instead it kept escalating. Lennon lashed out in some sort of stubborness and Ringo seems to have sat on the sidelines when he could have stuck up for Paul.  **So there's a lesson about passivity as well.** I could go on. My point is that, by lying about the breakup of biggest band in the world, and telling that story over and over...whole generations of songwriters have learned terrible lessons about how to be successful.¬† Often those lessons are the exact opposite of what they should be doing. And it shouldn't be that way.  **Writing music is hard enough without lies like these.** Anyway, that's enough for today.  It took a lot of work to write this, thanks for reading and I look forward to the discussion in the comments.","The Beatles were isolated with each other in a way no other band has had to deal with before or since.  Starting in Germany they had to share a small room in the back of a theater. They were having sex with women in bunk beds with everyone else in the room. Then on tour they were traveling the world, but they were always confined to a hotel room with each other because if they stepped out they'd get mobbed. Even when they stopped touring, they were so famous they were always The Beatles.  There's no way they could go through life like that and not have it cause a strain on their relationship, even if they were good friends.  I mean we've all had good friends before, but how many of us want to be stuck in a room with our best friend for the rest of our lives?  When they broke up, they were all in their late twenties, married, and thinking about starting families. Every one of them must have been thinking about how much more of their lives they were going to dedicate to each other. I don't think you can reduce the breakup to any single factor. There were a multitude of factors that made them all sick of playing together.  If they really wanted to keep playing together, they would have. They had plenty of opportunities to reunite during the next decade, but they never did it. If it was all about money, we would expect the band to reunite once money was no longer an issue. At the end of the day, they just didn't want to play together anymore.",162
g5l6sl,"There's been a lot of discussion lately about *Pitchfork* giving out their first ""10/10"" in some time. It got me thinking and conversing with my friends about exactly what *is* a 10/10. To be clear, I don't mean what musical components or themes in an album make a 10. That's going to be different for each individual. I'm also not looking for a list of albums. I'm more talking about rating theory.    The root of the question is probably mathematical. What is the distribution of 10/10 records? What does that bell curve look like? Out of every 1000 records that have been released, how many of them should be considered 10/10? 10? 1? Even fewer than that? The same question for 5/10's or 1/10's? How rare are they, or rather, how rare should they be?","To be honest, I think it's subjective to the point of being useless. Everyone is going to have a different metric for judging something. Two people could agree one every aspect of an album, and one might rate it a 10 and the other a 1.",290
g5wrzw,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb-SVPJM4L4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb-SVPJM4L4) Hazelwood's spaghetti western country vocals mixed with Sinatra's dreamy, angelic vocals and transitions from his vocals to hers back to his, it's just a fascinating, haunting song the way it was produced and crafted. It draws you in. I know Lana del Rey has cited Nancy Sinatra as an inspiration for her music and you can definitely hear it in this song.  Couldn't imagine what it would have been like back in 1967 hearing it for the first time especially from Nancy Sinatra of ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin"" and ""Sugar Town"" being Frank's kid. It must have been quite daring and bold especially when you listen to the lyrics. I wish she and Lee had explored this sound further and not chased the pop hits so much cause it showed a lot of potential for Nancy Sinatra (not just a pretty pop voice) and it's easily her best work.",I once put this song on while on ketamine and I don't think my life has been the same since.,23
g6jccv,"i can appreciate elements of a song even if i don't like certain other things.  For example, Bruno Mars, That's What I Like....great music and he sings nicely.  the melodies are catchy.  I don't mind the lyrics but there is one part that particularly irks me.  ""you got it if you want it, take my wallet if you want it"".  The whole song is pretty much based on materialism telling his significant other to jump in the cadillac and put some miles on it, and basically being generous with his wealth.  Not really my thing, maybe because i just have certain beliefs on it and hate materialism to this extent.  Granted, if i actually loved someone that much, i don't see a problem with it.   &#x200B; I just dislike how much it is marketed towards the masses and people eat it up and think that's what ""love"" is or something.  I dislike the idea of the foundation of a relationship a guy spending loads of money on a woman just because she's......cute.  There's so much more to relationships and much more meaning to be had that people are even unaware of because it seems like a lot of them actually follow this template. I know i may be looking too deep into something so shallow and meant purely for entertainment, but that's what differentiates my taste.  Does this stuff bother you guys as much as it bothers me?  What exactly are your limits to make you NOT want to listen anymore? What topics in music or perspective expressed in the lyrics make you turn it off and disregard ALL other liked elements?","No because I really won't be happy if I let my sociopolitical views influence every single thing in my life.

g715v5,"I'm working on a series called ""Good-Bad Albums,"" where I take terrible records and defend their honor. This is the first entry. **Good-Bad Review: Smash Mouth's** ***Fush Yu Mang*** **(1997)** MTV's TRL wrote the handbook on selling out. Sure, we've all heard stories of record executives offering contracts to any band with spiked hair in the late 70s, and by the time Carson Daly & Co. took to the air in 1998, we were still sporting high fashion's ‚Äúgrunge‚Äù apparel that came at a premium... but now, there were guidelines. Total Request Live didn't just promise teenagers an opportunity to call in for their favorite artists; it promised artists a career path. All you had to do was figure out the perfect blend of pop-song formulation and punk rock antics. Do this, and major labels‚Äîstill in search of the next Nirvana, or perhaps looking to make Green Day a franchise‚Äîwould notice. With luck, you could strike a deal, and inevitably be expected to produce a music video. That video could end up on TRL, the program that conveniently landed in a time-slot that began right around the time kids were getting home from school. And if that video could captivate *the kids*, you could become a sensation. Imagine your crappy pop-punk band on an arena tour, appearing in teen-sex comedies, and providing the soundtrack to the summer's biggest kids' movie. Cashing in had become an art-form. That's exactly where Smash Mouth would find themselves at the turn of the century. But before they were all stars, or believers, or whatever the hell they would become, they were hardly walking on the sun. ‚ÄúWalkin' on the Sun,‚Äù after all, would prove to be the sole hit of their 1997 debut *Fush Yu Mang*‚Äîand the only glimmer of insight that album would offer into just how obnoxious the band could be when they really applied themselves. Seriously, ‚ÄúWalkin' on the Sun‚Äù sounds like a song you'd likely hear over the blown-out stereo of a taxi cab with a 311 bumper sticker while you ask the driver to pull over so you can puke up the Quaalude you ate with lunch. It is the opposite of a diamond in the ruff: the one instance of distasteful artistry hidden amongst a tracklist of 11 bursts of ska-punk ingenuity. Or something like it. Let's take a moment to dissect that album title. I'm pretty sure that *Fush Yu Mang* is the band's racially insensitive approximation of an Asian immigrant's pronunciation of ‚Äúf\*ck you man.‚Äù This theme would be revisited on 1999's *Astro Lounge*, where vocalist Steve Harwell forces a Jamaican accent on the reggae-pop gang bang, ‚ÄúRoad Man.‚Äù There's a distinct possibility that Smash Mouth are racists, or at the very least just plain assholes... but I digress. Unfortunately dated by social norms of the 90s or not, the reality is that this album is infectious. The hooks are so catchy that I hate myself every time I mimic the Beach Boys influenced falsettos of ‚ÄúBeer Goggles‚Äù (a song where Harwell brags about being a sex addict who just wants ‚Äúsomeone, anyone...?‚Äù I can't even with this band).   	Yet, Harwell is hardly the selling point of this record. The band absolutely slams. It's almost hard to believe that this is the same group that performed on subsequent records by The 'Mouth. From the instant you press play, the two-step drumbeat of opening track ‚ÄúFlo‚Äù punches you in the face in a belligerent episode of punk rock fury. By the time they rescind for the first verse, the arrangement centers itself around those all-too familiar ska-punk upstrokes that embody the spirit of SoCal culture at the time. When I listen to this record, I want to go guerrilla pool-skating before the band even finds time to offer a chorus. When the guitars aren't bouncing back-and-forth between distorted power-chords and fun-loving upstrokes, bassist Paul De Lisle treats us all to his fuzz pedal. It's difficult to nominate a stand-out track from this album, but ‚ÄúThe Fonz‚Äù is as good a contender as any. It perfectly demonstrates the unlikely charm of this album in under 4-minutes. Harwell offers an exceptional understanding of melody, with just enough gravel to keep it cool. The guitars shimmer in contrast to one of the nastiest bass tones in all of alternative rock, until they stomp on the distortion and break every limiter in the studio for the choruses in classic loud-quiet-loud fashion. All the while, the drums provide tight, snappy precision that keep the groove pulsing forward without ever sacrificing attitude. *Fush Yu Mang* moves as quickly as the tempo on the choruses to ‚ÄúLet's Rock,‚Äù a fusion of two-tone and skate-punk that could easily be mistaken for mid-career NOFX. The lyrics range from endearingly dumb to undoubtedly witty. Paired with noteworthy ska-punk arrangements, this is a record that perfectly surmises mid-90s slacker-ism and marries it to a coal-furnace full of anger that gives the music conviction. There is as much angst as there is anguish in these songs, so much so that I feel ridiculous once I remember this is a Smash Mouth album. If that doesn't sell you, did I mention that it all climaxes with a ska cover of ‚ÄúWhy Can't We Be Friends?‚Äù Just be sure to tune out of the band's career once the needle stops.","I actually do think their first record is great. It's fun, energetic, and ""Walkin' On the Sun"" is a pretty neat song about generational differences aall while being a pastiche of late 60s rock a la The Doors. Good write-up, sums up a lot of what I think about the album. Also, Astro Lounge is *also* a great record in my opinion.",80
g7gjwk,"I grew up a rocker kid in the Midwest; graduated in 2011. Typical teenage worship of a lot 60's and 70's music was common. A lot of kids in my highschool were into Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, The Beatles; these groups were all assumed to be immortal pillars of rock n roll. Lately, I've talked to teenagers who listen to all of the above except Aerosmith. A lot of the time these kids don't even know Aerosmith is a band. Why are some bands fading out of consciousness while other similar groups maintain a youth following?","This might just be my personal taste, but I've never considered Aerosmith as in the same league as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, etc.  I don't see them as nearly as influential or critically acclaimed as the others you mentioned despite being very popular.",412
g82je8,"Or rather, why does she evoke so much *passion* from people either against or defending her?   Now *obviously* Billie Eilish isn‚Äôt completely hated, she wouldn‚Äôt be one of the biggest artists in the world if she was and her doubt album, *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*, received acclaim from most music critics. However for some reason she definitely has a very vocal hatedom against her and I‚Äôm not sure why. Especially considering the music she makes is very inoffensive.   The most interesting thing about the backlash for me is that it‚Äôs very gender-specific. Young women make up the vast majority of Billie Eilish‚Äôs fanbase, while most young boys seem to be apathetic or dislike her. This gender divide is most apparent on social media. On more female-dominated spaces such as Instagram or Twitter the majority of the conversation about her and her art is very positive and adulating, while male-dominated platforms such as Reddit for the most part *detest* her.   The hatred Reddit has for Billie is of particular note due to how intense it can be. Take the subreddit r/unpopularopinion for example, the sub has an absolutely [*staggering*](https://www.imgur.com/a/7eExZfK) [amount](https://imgur.com/a/lFKRCrQ) of posts solely dedicated to bashing her.   And the strange thing is that most of the criticism isn‚Äôt aimed at her *music*, but at *her* as a person. Many of her detractors claim that she ‚Äúfakes‚Äù having depression, [despite that being untrue:](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/9/5/20851342/billie-eilish-depression-mental-health) >Two years ago, I felt like nothing mattered; every single thing was pointless,‚Äù she said in the article published Thursday. ‚ÄùNot just in my life, but everything in the whole world. I was fully clinically depressed. It‚Äôs insane to look back and not be anymore.‚Äù >Eilish has been accused by trolls of faking her depression, which she admitted have been painful to read. >‚ÄúIt hurt me to see that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄùI was a 16-year-old girl who was really unstable. I‚Äôm in the happiest place of my life, and I didn‚Äôt think that I would even make it to this age.‚Äù >The 17-year-old said her mental health has since improved, calling happiness a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù feeling. >‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been happy for years,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think I would be happy again. And here I am ‚Äî I‚Äôve gotten to a point where I‚Äôm finally okay. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm famous. It‚Äôs not because I have a little more money. It‚Äôs so many different things: growing up, people coming into your life, certain people leaving your life.‚Äù >The singer added she wants people to know there‚Äôs hope on the other side of depression. >‚ÄúFor anybody who isn‚Äôt doing well, it will get better,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄùHave hope. I did this [expletive] with fame riding on my shoulders. And I love fame! Being famous is great, but it was horrible for a year. Now I love what I do, and I‚Äôm me again. The good me. And I love the eyes on me.‚Äù  Indeed, ‚Äú14 year old girls who listen to Billie Eilish and fake depression‚Äù seems to be a common punching bag for the internet these days, [even in the comment sections of her own songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh21Yu2VGRM) What‚Äôs troubling to me is that there seems to be a misogynistic undercurrent to the ‚Äú14-year-old-girls‚Äù meme, the implication being that young women can‚Äôt *really* experience depression or suicidal thoughts, and *must* be faking it for attention.  On this very subreddit, which is meant to be a place for mature, in depth discussions about music, I‚Äôve seen comments calling her a ‚Äútalentless industry plant‚Äù or even ‚Äúmusically illiterate‚Äú for not knowing who Van Halen is, a band formed over 29 years before she was born.  I wonder if the reason for the backlash is due to overplay of her song *Bad Guy*, which does have a very r/im14andthisideep vibe. But according to her, the song is meant to be ironic, a satire of rebellious teenagers who think they‚Äôre hot shit:  >[The initial idea for the song is like people that have to tell everybody that they are a certain way all the time? They‚Äôre not that certain way. In general, I feel like you will never catch a bad bitch telling everyone she‚Äôs a bad bitch. It‚Äôs on‚Äîit‚Äôs you. If you‚Äôre going around all the time saying like, ‚ÄòYeah, I‚Äôm bad, I‚Äôm always breaking rules, and doing this and doing that.‚Äô You‚Äôre not. I know that because I used to say that and I wasn‚Äôt. Bad kids, bad boys, bad bitches, whatever, they do that shit and they don‚Äôt even know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=v-hmiCqThDQ&app=desktop&persist_app=1)  Or maybe the hate is caused by her seven Grammy wins, an act that justified the ‚Äúindustry plant‚Äù narrative in the eyes of many. Or maybe it‚Äôs due to [this](https://youtu.be/YavL_IVSGV4) interview, where she shares some rather ignorant opinions on a variety of subjects, but that is excusable due to her young age.  What are your thoughts?","I think you pretty much explained why. She‚Äôs popular, young, and more importantly appeals to a younger, usually more female audience. Any music that appeals to a younger audience faces backlash like Justin Bieber, One Direction, etc. Artists who appeal more to women also get hate from Reddit. Beyonc√© fans can get a little out there but you‚Äôll see reddit posts talking about how she can‚Äôt sing or isn‚Äôt relevant in pop culture. You don‚Äôt have to like her but those are pretty ignorant takes and I think it‚Äôs mostly because she appeals to other women.  I could be wrong but I picture reddit to be made up mostly of millennial guys in their mid 20s to mid 30s or so. That‚Äôs the age group when you stop being the target demographic for pop music and don‚Äôt quite always ‚Äúget it‚Äù like you used to. Also Billie Eilish is a teenager in the public eye and teenagers always say stupid pseudo intellectual shit. If any of us had that kind of spotlight on us at that age I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd all be easy to ridicule.",386

g96m40,"A while ago, a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/g4imuu/in_defense_of_inoffensive_music?sort=top) was defending what the author called ""inoffensive"" music, bands like Coldplay, Snow Patrol, stuff like that. A lot of the comments didn't agree with what they had said, people said the artists they mentioned were in fact just boring, which I would tend to agree with, but I have a hard time articulating why. I'm not trying to rehash that discussion, but it brought to mind questions in to how we distinguish between what we find good and bad. Specifically one of the things that came to mind was genres meant to be more relaxing, or vibe-y so to speak. Personally, I really enjoy dream-pop style stuff; one of my favourite albums of the last decade is Beach House's Teen Dream. I find it super relaxing, really easy to listen to, great background music, no one would be taken aback to hear it in a department store, like there's nothing challenging about it, but these are all the same points someone might point to with bands like Coldplay or a lot of other soft pop type stuff in order to trash it. Teen Dream, on the other hand, was pretty well-received by critics and fans alike - Pitchfork gave it a 9 and 21st on their top 200 of the decade, and it's got a 3.7 on rym and it's #4 for 2010 on the site. What is it about it that makes it ""better"" than stuff like Coldplay? Like is it just better executed, better at making you feel the emotions it's trying to convey? One criticism I've seen on Coldplay is that it feels like music by committee, where it's made to appeal to as wide of an audience as possible, which I think I agree with, but is that coloured by my subconscious disdain? Would I have the same opinion if I had no prior knowledge of pop culture and either band? does an element of it have to do with popularity, like would people clown on Beach House as much as they do Coldplay if you swapped their radio play and mainstream success? I know it's not like Beach House is some obscure underground act, they have 2.5 million monthly listeners on Spotify, but does it have something to do with the fact that like, most people that end up listening to Beach House are doing it by choice, whereas with Coldplay, a lot of people hearing it might just be in a public place, or on the radio and might not be into it?  That's just an example and there's many more albums I can think of that fit that vibe, but my discussion point boils down to, ""**how do we draw the line between relaxing and boring**?"" I guess? Personal preference is of course the main thing but I'm just wondering if anyone else has thoughts on this topic, I found it very interesting to think about.","Here's what I think: There is no line. It is 100% subjective. I could be listening to Nightcall, lost in another dimension, while my friend could hear nothing more than a nostalgic cash in. My friend could love Home's Resonance while all that I'd hear would be a watered down version of the synthwave I know all too well. The line between relaxing and boring is a line shaped by the person. It's like questioning why certain people love particular genres while others see them as just noise. Also, if we're looking at the example of Beach House and Coldplay, the difference is their purpose. One is plain pop rock meant to be digested as easily as possible while the other is ethereal music with many layers hiding beneath the initial listen. You're bored when you know the 4 chords, the verse, the bridge and the chorus down to a point. But once there's something more sophisticated going on, your mind will be in a different state, focused on the music. When the song's got your attention, even if that attention is subconscious,  the track can hit you with whatever it's hiding.  Gotta mention: I've never heard a sentence where someone said 'dream pop' and also didn't mention Beach House.",107
g9mtes,"I've been making monthly Spotify playlists since November 2018 and it's something I've really enjoyed doing ever since, probably the main way I listen to music now over full albums. Just any song that I hear that I like, only rule I try to have is to not have the same song in a different months playlist. It's made me realise how it also acts like a journal, documenting songs that I come across, mainly through new releases, a song from a movie or TV show, being at a gig, or even just my Discover Weekly. It also made me notice how I lose interest on songs that appear at the beginning of the playlist, sometimes even wonder why I had them in in the first place. Does anyone else do it? How do you find it? It's something that I have gotten a few of my friends into and they seem to enjoy it as well.

I'm in love with it ‚Äì the flow and rhymes by Snoop just sound effortless, and the production is really on point and doesn't sound super dated to me over 25 years later. I know it was released in '93, right after The Chronic. That album featured Snoop on arguably its most iconic track, so that was most likely the biggest catalyst in the boost to his popularity. I guess I'm just pretty stunned that Doggystyle sold almost a million copies week one... when Snoop was really only featured on The Chronic. Was he that larger than life immediately? How did he get so popular in such a short amount of time? And also, if his only real exposure to the general public was the features on The Chronic, would he be in contention to be one of the most successful featured artists on an album of all time? I know he has quite the personality, and the genre was really hot at the time, but his sudden rise to ""rap god"" status is pretty amazing to me. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts!","Wow. Thanks for this question. Inglewood kid here. Sitting here reminiscing on this era since we just found out they're selling the Crenshaw mall, a staple in this album. It was an amazing time to be a kid, and to watch the cultural impact and shift that album had not just on LA, but on Hip Hop as a whole was pretty amazing. I'm going to constructively run down memory lane for a while.    So let me set you up. Early 1990s music culture. Movie soundtracks were still REALLY important in music and were used as launching platforms for several musicians' careers. Deep Cover was a good movie, but the soundtrack was even better, and its where you have Snoop's very FIRST appearance with Dre. This is what started the buzz around Snoop, Death Row's launching, and Dre's upcoming Chronic album. In LA, especially just south of Inglewood, you could see the cultural shift, especially in the gang culture that was around. Music affiliations and gang affiliations almost became one and the same. From there, he guested on a few other songs, but really had his breakthrough on Dre's Chronic. That was strategic on Dre's part, and smart. From there, Snoop had a starting run on EVERYONE. They went into the studio, Dre gave Snoop his best beats to date and recorded Doggystyle. Suge then started funneling (illegal) monies to start promotion of the album in early 1994... and based off the solid buzz Dre and Snoop had built for themselves.... the rest was history. G-Funk era had arrived.    From there, Snoop became one of the firsts outside of Michael Jackson and a few others to move a million in the first week. It was everywhere. In every car, on every booming system. Every party. 92.3 the beat, Power 106 lived off that album that summer. Everyone was buying the video on The Box. It defined LA culture for years. Even I have a fun fact: You can see me and a mentor in the Gin And Juice video til this day (he filmed that video around La Tijera elementary in the Ladera area of LA). And the hilarious thing was, that wasn't even the best release of that year. We also had Fugees Score, Wu Tang was starting to protect their necks.... 1994 overall had to be one of the best years for hip hop AND rock music.     Downside? It was the start of that whole gangbangin era of hip hop, and it could get toxic quick, as you can see. People died. Women were hurt. It also it really pushed aside a lot of the fun, positive era of hip hop. The shift to G-Funk definitely left legends like ATCQ, De La, Heavy D, Black Moon, GangStarr and 'em struggling to keep up with the shift in sound. Maybe not shift in sounds (De La's Stakes is high is FOREVER), but more a shift in the culture.     Funny you ask this question now.  Its the 28th anniversary of the 1992 riots, and it's around about this time that he began to really break out on the scene. Your music senses must have been tingling. lol.     Anyways, hope you enjoyed. AMA on what it was like to be 12 when the G-Funk era came into play in Los Angeles.",206

gc6ud1,"I have a confession to make: I think [Fiona Apple's latest album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emXYPRlVBas) is good but ... well ... not phenomenal. In fact I would even say it has some issues.  Yet her album[ seems to be met with massive critical acclaim,] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetch_the_Bolt_Cutters#Reception) despite not being particularly innovative (my main ""issue"" with it is that it's really similar sounding to a lot of her stuff off of her last album from ~10 years ago). Sure, it's a good album, but will it be remembered as a legendary, genre defining, culturally defining album 20 years from now? Probably not.  It seems that some artists get to such a level of success early in their careers that critics/audiences start reviewing their reputation rather than the actual work. **Why does this happen?** How can artists go off the grid for years and years and then drop an album and people go absolutely crazy for it? Is it a nostalgia thing? A notoriety thing? Simple fan bias?  **The other question that comes to mind is: Is it deserved?** For example if John Lennon were still alive today, if he released an average EP would people hail it simply because it's another piece in his already existing body of phenomenal work? **Should** some artists be able to ride on their wave of success after they reach a critically renowned point? PS: I don't mean to pick on Fiona Apple, she's a wonderful musician and I like her a lot -- she's just the most recent primary example that comes to mind.","In b4 topic devolves. I'm having trouble seeing the idea that an artist can coast solely on prior critical success without the current album in question also being of quality. A relatively weak album might put a slight dent in things, but as long as the quality is mostly consistently there, I think it's a bit self-explanatory as to why these artists stay acclaimed. It also helps that some of these artists have obvious career trajectories or themes on their album that make it easy for critics to write about.  As for whether it's deserved, well, I guess it depends. I don't really like the strategy of late of relying on meta commentary to dismiss these works by using its acclaim against it. It's not addressing any of the album's supposed faults and used more as a way to dismiss the critic more than anything. I'll maybe cede that some relatively lesser albums are kept more visible due to acclaim, but it's likely they would've done so any way sheerly from association with the artist's body of work.",91
gcftxh,"When I was a teenager in the 2000s (aughts, noughts, noughties, whatever), this sticker was my enemy. I didn't grow up in a very religious household, but I grew up in what I would call a very ""more Protestant than Christian"" household. My parents were very strict about my media consumption growing up and payed very close attention to ratings. I wasn't allowed to play ""T"" rated video games until I turned 13, and the PG-13 movies my parents let me watch before that age was very limited (Lord of the Rings and Jurassic Park were the exceptions). Likewise with ""R"" rated movies. I was able to get away with ""M"" video games if I played them at friends' houses as a teenager. Of course, this all changed after I went to college. I got into music around the age of 13, and I was very angered to find that the ""Parental Advisory"" sticker, like video game and movie ratings, was something my parents took very seriously at the time (thanks Tipper Gore). I was not allowed to buy any CDs with this label attached to them. I have vivid memories battling with my parents for them not letting me buy ""American Idiot"" by Green Day and them making me pay more for the edited version of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""Greatest Hits"" album. And as a kid without a huge rebellious streak as a teenager, I never considered buying them behind my parents' back. I would take the ""soft rebellion"" approach and just listen to the stuff I wasn't allowed to have at my friends' houses. I often found myself seeking out CDs that didn't have the label on them, and at Walmart buying the edited versions of the albums. This is probably the biggest reason why I had *very* few hip-hop albums growing up. Of course, growing up, I learned that many of the ""clean"" albums I had actually were just as dirty as many ""Parental Advisory"" albums, as the label was to some extent optional, and more relevant to major labels than independent labels. But in today's day and age, in which hip-hop reigns supreme, and ""vulgar"" lyrics are more or less normal and expected in pop music, does the ""Parental Advisory"" still have any influence? Are there young people who still struggle navigating their music listening around this label, especially in the age of Spotify and streaming, when it feels like there are no barriers at all?","Well most people listen to music using streaming services on their phones and computers so they don‚Äôt usually have to buy a physical copy of the album.

When I realized I could download music from the internet, the world opened, and I discovered a lot of new artist/genres. Yet today, when literally most of the music ever recorded is in my pocket, I stopped discovering new music. The only ‚Äúnew‚Äù music I am listening too are the songs that have some special meaning to me (heard it at a party etc). Whenever I force myself to listen to new music, I find many of them that I like, but somehow do not have the willingness to go back and listen to them again. It feels like I have to put in effort to listen to new music. Somehow whether I know the song and the lyrics of a song or not became the most important factor whenever I am choosing what music to listen to. Even when my favorite artists release a new album, I would listen to it once, and have no desire to come back to it, regardless of how I liked it. I used to be a huge rock/metal fan, now I don‚Äôt even know which genres/artists I like. Anyone else feels the same? Is there any way to recapture my love for music, or is it natural that it disappears with age? Or is it simply due to the paradox of choice?","Mine are 30 years old, but I still love discovering music I like. It‚Äôs like math and language, you have a window to maximize. It‚Äôs age.

gdw20d,"Ever since Chuck Berry invented his sly, teenage persona, rock and rollers have sneered at the ""boy next door"" types. Why be square when you can be rebellious, sexy, eccentric, wild, weird or dangerous? Male rock singers have always embraced their idiosyncrasies: Hendrix's autonomous highway child; Bowie's crazed theatre-boy; Kurt Cobain's pained weirdo. There are a few exceptions to this rule: the early Beach Boys, the Vegas era Elvis. But for the most part rockers have avoided being square like it was some kind of disease. Jack White, however, is an exception all his own. Not in the same sense as the young Beach Boys: he's too God damn strange, too pale, too hard edged in his riffs. But whilst most rockers would have embraced this, the *Blood Cells*/*Elephant* era White Stripes reveal an insecurity most would never admit to. Not only does Jack White want The Girl Next Door: he wants be the good old fashioned Boy Next Door to her. And that is unusual, to say the least. On ""Hotel Yorba"" he declares he wants to get married in a big cathedral by a priest. In ""I Can Learn"" he promises to reenact the love stories he's seen before and learn lullabies for his ""true love"". Do you think Mick Jagger ever gave a damn about what your mother thought? Well, Jack White confesses he wants to ""warm her heart"". One of his most touching songs, ""We're Going to Be Friends"" is about a playground crush that, in an ideal world, would end with him and Suzy Lee married as adults. The implication of *White Blood Cells* is that, for a while at least, Jack did his best to be a gentleman and *did* get the Girl Next Door. But, like I said before: Jack White is no Boy Next Door, a lesson he learns the hard way. He wants to please The Girl Next Door's family on ""I Want to be the Boy"" and ""Offend in Every Way"", but they are repulsed by him. He gets damn right tired of trying to be the Boy he's not in ""Expecting"" and, most tellingly, ""I'm Finding It Harder to Be Your Gentleman"". And The Girl Next Door isn't as perfect or simple as he initially thought: she is human in her faults and complexities. In ""Dead Leaves"", Jack returns home with a heart full of love only to find the Girl is gone. All of this apexes at ""Union Forever"", where he looks at the disaster of his relationship and declares ""there is no true love"". And it is on ""Union Forever"" he actually shows some pride for not being ""Interested in gold mines/ Oil wells, shipping or real estate/ What would I liked to have been?/ Everything you hate"". Through his pain, he learns to embrace who he is. *Elephant* still carries some pain for the failed relationship of *White Blood Cells,* but at this point Jack White grows from dejected weirdo to world-conquering-rock-god weirdo. With every album hereafter he gets weirder and louder. But that still leaves us with the fascinating artefact of *Blood Cells*: an album not just about learning to accept a failed relationship, but about learning the consequences of trying to be someone you're not to please someone who's not right for you. By the end of it, you sense Jack is ready to heal and move on from the mistakes of the past. So in short, Jack White was a weirdo who had to learn how to embrace his weirdness: being the boy next door simply didn't suit him. But that he would confess to his desires to be so is, I think, an act of great courage- it's the reason *Blood Cells* will always be my favourite White Stripes album. Has anyone else got love for The White Stripes? Penny for your thoughts?","This is awesome and so well done. Not sure if you know this but those lyrics in ‚ÄòUnion Forever‚Äô came from the film Citizen Kane. It could be cool to tie in the themes of that film into your themes presented here, given the movie was important to Jack White.",120
gef13a,"I used to love music. I sang in choir. I played the violin, which at first I genuinely wanted to. I would play in the school orchestra and at church and took lessons. I loved music. It was a part of every part of my life. Unfortunately for me, music was extremely bonded to my religion and my faith, which I left. I had been a sincere believer so leaving was traumatic. Music  was also tied to the good regard of my parents and their expectations of who I aught to have been. My folks forced me to play classical and take lessons for years after I lost the joy. I kept asking to switch to something else or at least stop lessons for a bit to reduce the pressure but they insisted and then nagged at me about how ungreatful I was to waste their money if I didn't practice. Playing an instrument brings up shame, anxiety, and anger for me. It has been a long hard fought road. It's been 10 years since I have done much involving music beyond the occasional dance club. My life is much better now in general. In many ways I have reclaimed my life. I still want to heal this part of myself. I want to play an instrument again. I still have a soft spot for the violin. I miss singing. Everytime I pick something up though, even a different instrument, doing more than a few strums or plucks feels like carrying rock up a mountain emotionally. So, I am interested if there's others like me out there who ""love"" music but have an ""it's complicated"" relationship status with it. What got you to this point?

ggromy,"One of the greatest artists in modern times imo, with a detailed eye for composition. I was a kid in the 90's, and I think the first time I really paid attention to D'angelo (along with many ladies) was his Untitled video. I remember my parents banning me from watching it, but behind the video, the music was so poignant, and so sincere. You could feel it in your soul. Even back then not even a preteen I was mesmerized by the mans undeniable talent. I was used to listening to the soul and blues my father used to play, and this seemed like the closest thing to the music I loved back then.      Unfortunately D'angelo's retreat from fame would mean I grow up without ever really getting to appreciate his music, instead settling for the Usher's and Souldchild's of the world. Not bad, but not the raw talent that D'angelo was and still is. I've had the opportunity recently years to re-discover His music, and his work is just mind blowing. Even more impressive is his heavy hand in production virtually outlining all the music for the other musicians on his album along with greats like Pino Palladino.      From what I can gather D'angelo was on the cusp of totally reforming modern black rnb and soul. He was spearheading a new movement of artistry and everything was falling into place. Then ... he left. I've just finished watching his documentary Devil's pie, (discoverable with a little google work) and it really gave me an eye into the whole backstory of what happened. To sum it up, a conflicted soul raised in a small church in Virginia where he formed his musicality, propelled into greatness and fame, and all the vices that come with it, bowing out before he could fully take his stand. It's not a totally uncommon theme, lots of amazing musicians have transferred over from church music to secular and have experienced similar woes. But still sad in the sense, he had to go through that pain.      D'angelo's last project was Black Messiah. Another masterpiece imo, with something outstanding grooves and production. 'Ain't that easy' a personal favorite of mine.     Maybe some of you who were grown in the 90's. (or at least not banned from his videos) could tell me what it was like to see D'angelo on the rise back then. What did you think would become of him? How were you affected by his music? Edit: Here's a link to some of my favorite works of his, each taken from one of his three albums in order. I'd love to discuss any of these songs from a musical standpoint      [Brown Sugar (Brown sugar album)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaV7oCyFXaY)      [One Mo' Gin (Vodoo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQq-KwgolxE)      [Ain't That Easy (Black Messiah)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZoxdPGu_4E)      [Devil's pie documentary (you need a Netherlands vpn location to watch)](https://www.npostart.nl/3doc-devils-pie-dangelo/23-11-2019/VPWON_1263299)","Though I was only a teenager then I thought it was cool to see the Neo-Soul movement, partially because it really contrasted against the crass materialism of hip-hop and offered a different window into the Black experience that seemed to be a bit lacking.

ghq4cp,"For over 60 years now, the title of ""King of Rock & Roll"" has been held by Elvis. But in more recent times, individual people and critics alike have challenged this title, insisting that either Chuck Berry or Little Richard were more deserving of the title. Here's a few reasons why I think Elvis is and isn't deserving of the title: A couple of why Elvis is ""The King of Rock"": 1. Nobody came close to the record sales and cultural impact of Elvis. 2. African American artists like Chuck Berry and Little Richard sadly would have not seen airplay on most white radio stations if it wasn't for Elvis (as it was, some stations still banned African American recorded records, even though they were starting to see huge sales in the wake of Rock & Roll).  A couple of reasons why Elvis WASN'T ""The King of Rock & Roll: 1. While Elvis is definitely a pioneering artist in rock music, his Influence isn't as directly heard in rock music as Chuck Berry and Little Richard's influence is. 2. Elvis HATED the nickname ""The King of Rock & Roll"". Elvis was a deeply religious man. He said multiple times that he was ""Just a performer"" and that ""Jesus Christ was the real King"". It would oddly be more respectful to Elvis if we stopped calling him ""The King of Rock & Roll"" What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments.","In addition to what everyone said here, I do just want to point out that Elvis never acted like he was either the greatest or an innovator in the music, and he *never* hid his influences. One anecdote has him telling the press ""I'm not the king of rock n' roll, he is"" pointing to Fats Domino, and other times, he pointed out that rock n roll was just an extension of rhythm and blues, which was just an extension of gospel.  I say this because there's a tendency to hold Elvis as a proxy target for how innumerable black artists got screwed. As a fan of rock n roll and rockabilly, I agree Elvis is nowhere near the best in terms of ability or musical (as opposed to cultural) influence, but I've never been comfortable with the attitude that he somehow ""stole"" rock n roll, which is always put forth by people who have an extremely poor, simplified understanding for how rock n roll developed. But people still hear the line from ""Fight the Power"" and take it as gospel that Elvis was some malicious cultural interloper, and not a poor redneck kid who had the right sound at the right place, in the right time.  Chuck Berry and Little Richard (to say nothing of Fats Domino and Bo Diddley, as well as white rockers like Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, and Eddie Cochran, who rocked waaay harder than Elvis) deserve all the attention and credit, but we should be able to acknowledge their importance without writing revisionist thinkpieces that claim Elvis was some talentless culture vulture. Or at least blame the Beatles for stealing rock n roll (I have a theory for why the Beatles never get shat on by critics for the same reasons Elvis does, but that's for another post if anyone cares.)",152
giup0d,Does people importance and love for music diminish with age when they hit 30s or older. If so why do you think?  Is it harder to connect with lyrics as you age.,"In my mid-20s, still love discovering new music and can get get a really deep emotional connection to music. Sure that's the same for loads of others here. But you're 100% right, the teenage mind is uniquely malleable and especially, visceral. When you hear music as a teenager you're able to let it totally take over you in a way that's harder as an adult. That's why teenagers tend to throw themselves entirely into the genres, artists and styles they love. And all the accompanying fashions and culture that comes with it. Part of this might be neurological, that the teenage mind is still being formed and is still creating those pathways in the brain. So new experiences and especially ones that the person emotionally connects to can have a much bigger impact. I remember so clearly the first time I saw Green Day's American Idiot on the TV and how it was truly mindblowing. Like what the fuck was this?? What??? This exists? I'd heard music before and had got some CDs but that was the moment I truly let it take me over. Feel like that only happens once in their life for most people. But part of it is also cultural, as an adult you have the intellect to contextualise music a lot more. You can categorise it and organise it. You can debate it and ponder it and think it over. Challenge yourself and challenge overs. Consciously broaden and explore your own tastes. It's all very intellectual and very proper. You've also simply heard more music at that age, that killer riff, guitar solo, beat or flow have to compete with a lot of other riffs, solos, beats and flows that you've already heard and already probably love. And because of that it can't be that same overwhelming experience as a teenager. It's harder to totally throw yourself into the experience as a purely visceral thing.  Add to that the also economic, social and personal factors that come with people gaining more responsibilities as they grow older and being able to spend less time on their hobbies, passions and interests and I think there's something in that.",135

U2 is an interesting case- while a lot of bands that get similar hate, it‚Äôs for different reasons: nickelback and creed for being derivative/unoriginal, Metallica and Green Day for selling out, etc. U2 is a pretty original band, they definitely have a sound that‚Äôs been very influential and inspired a lot of bands. And they don‚Äôt sound like a watered-down ripoff of another band either. So does U2 get hate purely because of Bono? Personally I think Bono can be a bit overly messianic sometimes, but why does he seem to get nothing but hate for charity work while other celebrities (ie Princess Diana) are universally lauded for it? Imo a lot of people don‚Äôt seem familiar with U2 or Bono that much, and all they know about him is that he‚Äôs a famous rock star who likes sunglasses and wants to end poverty. Why is that a bad thing? AFAIK, he‚Äôs never said anything notably controversial or offensive- someone like Morrissey is the one who deserves that criticism. People also have a misconception that he only started doing nonprofit work once he got famous, which is incorrect. U2‚Äôs always been political.  And about the sunglasses- I get why it comes off as a bit douchey, but he actually wears them because he has glaucoma. Glaucoma is a type of blindness that makes you very sensitive to light, so someone on stage and in front of cameras all the time has an even harder time managing that condition. You know when someone takes your photo with a flash and you see purple spots after? That‚Äôs basically what glaucoma does, except it doesn‚Äôt go away, and instead of just purple spots, you can literally go blind from it. So can you really blame the guy for wanting to protect his eyes?  Then of course, there‚Äôs the iTunes thing from 2014. This is a big reason U2 seemed to get even more hate, and this is where a lot of it is misplaced. It‚Äôs also important to note that U2 was one of the first to to see iTunes‚Äô potential, and they were among the first to do a now-iconic black silhouette iTunes commercial. At the time, U2 released an album through iCloud- it was intended to be a creative way of releasing music, and U2 has always been interested in doing unique things no one else has done. Here‚Äôs the thing that people misunderstand- the album was never supposed to go directly to your phone or computer. It was supposed to go in the cloud, where you could download the whole thing for free if you wanted it. I‚Äôll admit this wasn‚Äôt a great idea, and I get why some people weren‚Äôt crazy about it.  This is the important part: people generally weren‚Äôt annoyed that U2 put an album in the cloud, they were primarily annoyed that they couldn‚Äôt delete it. That‚Äôs a fair sentiment. But U2 just made the music, they had no role in the actual technical rollout. Actually putting it in the cloud was 100% Apple. So if you‚Äôre gonna get annoyed that a random U2 album popped up in your library and you couldn‚Äôt get rid of it, be made at Apple. They‚Äôre the ones who actually were responsible for the technical details. Keep in mind this is the same company that imo hasn‚Äôt done anything innovative since Steve Jobs died- they‚Äôve made an Apple Pencil no one wants, and got rid of the headphone jack even after everyone told them not to. Yet U2 got 100% of the hate even though they literally just made the album. If Apple didn‚Äôt screw up, the free album would‚Äôve stayed in the cloud where you could delete it or download it. People probably would‚Äôve ignored it. That backlash happened because Apple screwed up and their bugs meant some people couldn‚Äôt delete it. Again, not U2‚Äôs fault at all.  It‚Äôs also important for people to know more about U2‚Äôs background. Yeah they‚Äôre now wealthy and world-famous, but they did NOT start there. None of them grew up wealthy at all, and even the more affluent among them were more middle-class in Ireland. Ireland is not a particularly rich country- yes it‚Äôs developed and not 3rd world, but it‚Äôs nowhere near the US or China or France etc. U2 also grew up in Ireland during the 70s, which was NOT a good time to grow up in. There was a huge heroin crisis that was killing loads of people. The economy was bad. And on top of that, there was legit terrorism tearing the country apart. Young people especially, and especially Americans, don‚Äôt know anything about Irish history. Ireland is not an independent country: there‚Äôs the 26 (I previously said 16, it‚Äôs actually 26) counties of the Republic of Ireland, then there‚Äôs the other 6 that form Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK. As a former British colony, Ireland has been violently fighting England for independence nearly non-stop for almost 800 years. You know the drink ‚ÄúIrish Car Bomb‚Äù? Yeah, that was pretty common in 70s Ireland. Bombings in Ireland happened all the time, and countless innocent civilians died because of it. In a war-torn country in the middle of a wrecked economy and heroin crisis, 4 kids managed to become one of the biggest artists of all time. And they did it with NO money and ZERO connections. Very different from how it is now.  So now that I‚Äôve set more of a background for how bad it was in 70s Ireland where U2 grew up, let‚Äôs see how far they‚Äôve come:  - highest grossing rock tour ever - 2nd highest grossing tour ever, only behind Ed Sheeran - 22 Grammys (more than any rock band, and 9th most of any artist)  - still constantly selling out shows in 2020 all over the world - inspired tons of artists, generally considered among the greatest rock bands ever  - 170 million albums sold - an album so culturally significant that the US preserved it in the Library of Congress (Joshua Tree) - gone from teenagers in a poor, violent country to collectively being worth over $700 million U2 formed as a bunch of teenagers in 1976, released their first album at only 20. They‚Äôre literally a high school band that made it- and they made it BIG. And they also did it with ZERO lineup changes or tragic overdoses, which is pretty rare for a rock band this successful. U2's the same 4 kids they started out as.  In conclusion: while it‚Äôs obviously ok to not like their music, U2 gets way too much hate.","The music they've made in the past 20 years is pretty bland and forgettable, but their early stuff is pretty fantastic. War is a great album, and The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree are all time classics. The band definitely had balls too, making some very political music in the early 80s that directly criticized their own country and the people of their own country. Like I don't understand how anyone can listen to Sunday Bloody Sunday or New Years Day and not think those songs are awesome. U2 are one of those bands that once you think about it, they have so many great songs. Where The Streets Have No Name, One, and Miss Sarajevo are some of the best pop rock songs ever written. I do think they get a lot of undeserved hate, but that's the way of internet circlejerks, they enjoy hating too much to give it fair chance.",200
gki2ql,"I really love music, just as many people do but there are certain songs that when I listen to move me a lot. This is really hard to explain but they make me feel like I should do something about how much I love this song. It's a really strange feeling because I never know what to do. Sometimes I think I should learn it on the piano and I do but that never really settles it. I even try writing out the lyrics of the song but that's not it either. I sometimes feel like a part of me wants to do music production and this is my calling or something but I really don't know. I was wondering if anyone else feels like this, just compelled by music and you love a song so much you want to do something about it but you don't know what. This sounds stranger now that I write it out but it's honestly something I deal with. &#x200B; EDIT: It's so great reading everyone's comments and knowing I'm not the only one who feels like this! Thanks for all the suggestions!!",Yes I understand that feeling completely. My solution is to listen to it over and over and over again. And then I'll get sick of it. And then rediscover it six months later... and repeat.,137
gl7xt5,"I keep listening to Silver Jews records (especially American Water and Natural Bridge) and his Purple Mountains album. David is one of my absolute favorite lyricists, and he put together some damn good songs to contain those words.  I vividly remember lying in bed and seeing the headline that he had died and just wishing it wasn't suicide. David's lyrics resonate so much with me because he seemed to stare right into the darkest places and manage to find the bright side.  I never even met the guy, but his death hit me like a friend's would. I still get sad when I think about it. Does anyone else here feel this way? Does anyone have any David Berman anecdotes to share?","I was with my girlfriend-at-the-time when I had read the news. I had literally bought tickets for my friend and I weeks ago for the show nearest us, and was just loving PM. It was devastating, and I am also still rocked by it. David was someone I looked up to in high school, well past any hope of seeing Silver Jews live. I had bought Actual Air around then, and it really touched me. Turned out I would be giving that friend a vinyl copy of PM for Christmas, and we both felt it. I can still listen to him when I am feeling high or low, but when I am low it just stings. I miss him. And I am glad that, if any good has come from this, it is reading about all the fans of his out there, and listening to so many musicians and contemporaries of David's that have continued to pay respect to him. Kevin Morby insists upon playing a SJ song during each of his From-Home livestreams. Thanks for sharing you feelings, bud.",58
gllxow,"I will always be the kind of guy who believes the music should come first and the image should come second. Rush doesn't really have an ""image"", but they write and play great music and it has made them into a very popular band. Conversely, bands like Sex Pistols and Kiss seem to be bands where the image is more important than the music. But, I don't believe an image is something that automatically makes a band good. However, if your image sucks, it can make a band seem pretentious and out of touch. A good example is a band like U2, Rattle and Hum is a pretty good album in terms of music. However, if you watch the documentary, the whole band (not just Bono) seems to come off as self important and thinking they're making the most important music in the world. This received backlash and they almost broke up because of it. They did a 180 in image with Achtung Baby and the ZOOTV Tour. So, I guess, do you agree with this sentiment?","I don‚Äôt really agree. I remember seeing an interview with Jack White some years ago where he said that what they wore and how their stage looked was more important than the music of the white stripes. That their image sold he music. Meg wasn‚Äôt the greatest drummer, and sure it fit what they were going for. But if they came out in Dad jeans and crocs, they would not have had the same amount of success. A band like Radiohead has no cohesive image and put out some of the best music on a consistent basis.",123
gm7vff,"This was me with King Crimson. I grew up in the countryside of western Tennessee. Growing up, my sister was (and still is) a fan of 60's and 70's rock. She started out just listening to the local classic rock station, but she soon branched out to satellite radio and the internet. That's when we discovered King Crimson. It was the most mind blowing thing I'd ever heard at that point in my life. I started talking about King Crimson with everyone I met, but neither my parents, nor any of my extended family for that matter, knew who they were. Also, none of my friends knew who they were (granted, church and homeschool group kids aren't really the target demographic of King Crimson). The only person I ran into that knew who they were was an ex boyfriend of my cousin, who only knew them because of his dad. None of the local radio stations played King Crimson, but The Jackson Madison County Library had ""In The Court of The Crimson King"" on CD (Jackson, Tennessee was the nearest city from were I lived). I also found a really beat up vinyl copy (missing the cover) of ""In The Court of The Crimson King"" at an antique shop (also in Jackson) which I passed on, since I really didn't think it would play. Other than that, King Crimson didn't seem to exist in my little world. In Memphis and Nashville, on the other hand, it was a different story. While I never heard King Crimson on the radio in my time there, I found King Crimson records fairly often (imagine trying to talk your parents into buying a record with a screaming guy on the cover) and I met people who knew who King Crimson were. When my family moved to Denver, I found even more people who knew who King Crimson were, and I even heard some King Crimson on the radio here occasionally.  Jump to last year. I decided to get a Reddit account, and naturally, I looked for music and record subreddits. I discovered that there were so many kids posting King Crimson records, that there's a circle jerk about it! Which makes me wonder, how the fuck were so many people unaware of this band in the area I grew up in???!? Surely I'm not the only one who felt they were the only one to know a band, only to find out everyone except your friends and family know them. Has anyone experienced anything like this?","Id seen a clip of Billie Eilish somewhere, and heard a bit of her music. I wasn't blown away by it, but thought it would be something my younger cousin would enjoy.  I thought she was a relatively unknown ""emerging"" type artist. So told my little cuz (im 36, he is 25) to check out this new artist id heard, named Billie Eilish. He thought i was being a smart ass. Because apparently she is the biggest thing in the world.

gme6gc,"Yeah we all love Dookie and AI, they‚Äôre classics. Other than them, the Green Day albums that seem to get talked about most are either Warning, 1039 or Insomniac. If you ask Green Day fans, 21CBD seems to get generally positive if not glowing reviews. So why TF does no one seem to talk about it? 21CBD was the 2009 follow up to American idiot. Initially the reception was that it was good but too similar to AI, and a not-as-good version of AI. I think AI has the bigger hits, but 21CBD imo is one of their top 3 albums with AI & dookie. 21CBD combines a huge rock opera sound ala AI, but with some interesting and creative experimentation. There‚Äôs a lot of piano all over the album, and it works really well. ‚ÄúLast Night on Earth‚Äù is one of their best songs, and it shows that Green Day can do a lot more than the pop punk they‚Äôre known for. Then there‚Äôs the fast-paced ‚ÄúMurder City‚Äù, which is a modern take on their classic 90s sound. There‚Äôs also ‚ÄúPeacemaker‚Äù, which combines their 2000s acoustic experimentation with a rockier edge and an interesting Polka influence. Very creative song that works really well.  Last but definitely not least is ‚ÄúRestless Heart Syndrome‚Äù. Aside from having some of BJ‚Äôs best lyrics and vocal performances, it shows how talented a band they really are: Restless Heart Syndrome is a master class in songwriting and dynamics. It starts off with just piano and BJ‚Äôs vocals, then the bass and drums enter to create a hypnotically depressing groove that draws you in. And the ending...my god that‚Äôs one of the heaviest, hardest-rocking things I‚Äôve ever heard. It builds up to a PERFECT solo, and shows that properly building up layers to get to that release is often the most satisfying (ie Stairway).  21st century breakdown isn‚Äôt just great because it combines 90s and 2000s Green Day, it‚Äôs great because the songwriting is genuinely fantastic. Aside from maybe Static Age, there‚Äôs not a bad song on the album. It‚Äôs also not an album of weird experimental songs that no one liked, it‚Äôs got 21 Guns, East Jesus Nowhere, Viva La Gloria, and Know Your Enemy, all of which are crowd favorites. Plus it was produced by legendary producer Butch Vig, who made Siamese Dream and Nevermind. Seriously, go listen to 21st Century Breakdown- it‚Äôs one of the best albums I‚Äôve ever heard. It‚Äôs got everything Green Day fans love- great melodies, killer rock songs, great acoustic songs, and creative experimentation that presents Green Day‚Äôs sound in a unique way. Yet it never seems to get mentioned outside the fanbase.  In conclusion: 21st century breakdown deserves recognition as one of Green Day‚Äôs best albums, I‚Äôd even argue one of the best 2000s rock albums.","I should give it a relisten, but it's hard to ignore the glaring fact that it's Green Day's *second* political rock opera.  At the time none of the songs grabbed me, and it would have to take some really amazing songs to make up for the worn out concept.  To be honest, even though *American Idiot* had great songs I found the political messaging to be kind of shallow. The reason why *Warning* is the most underrated in my mind is because of how it represents a path the band could have followed, or even returned to after *American Idiot*.  Makes me really sad, especially because Green Day's latest is total garbage.",103
gntjn5,"Duran Duran is a weird band to me, I get told by people older than me that they were once one of the biggest bands on Earth. In fact, if you read some articles from the time Rio came out, some critics said that they had the potential to be the next Beatles. Now, I understand that, because they started getting popular when MTV was starting off, so they sort of became the first superstars created by MTV. But, if we look at their peers around that time, The Cure, The Smiths, Depeche Mode, New Order, The Jam, they never got the acclaim from people. In my opinion, Hungry Like The Wolf is one of the best pop songs ever written, there's something about it that makes it such a great listen. They also have other well known song, A View To A Kill, The Reflex, and Girls On Film to name a few. My only explanation is that they were more of a pop band than a post punk band, but The Smiths weren't post punk either. Maybe because Duran Duran sang a lot about girls and sex, which was not the MO of the punk crowd. I don't know, maybe I'm misinformed, but I feel like they're a band you can't tell the history of music without, but again, they are never named as a massive influence on anybody","They were straight up pop, the others were indie bands. They tend to get more critical praise therefore as it is assumed they have more depth and musical merit.",193
goj3q3,"Many artists who were stars in their prime end up making music that is just a weaker version of the music they used to make. Eagles, Phil Collins, Elton John, and Doobie brothers come to mind. They make easy listening music that is in the style of the music that made them famous in the 70's/80's. Roger Waters and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd have each seen a decline in quality since the early 90's. Paul McCartney as well IMO.  To me late Bowie and Dylan are not as good as Ziggy Stardust or Blonde on Blonde. But their music utilizes different strengths that make up for what they've lost in vitality. Bowie's last two albums are filled with complex, rich music that reveals more with each listen. The arrangements are mathematically interesting and yet somehow still work on an elemental level.  Dylan's voice is obviously not what it was, but he uses his current, crackled voice to his advantage, marrying it effectively to the music that he chooses to make now. His lyrics aren't as fun or as exciting as they were in the mid 60's but he paints pictures with more emotional depth and he maintains an ability to play a character when he sings that puts him above many current artists.  I also think that Bryan Ferry of Rox Music achieves high quality music late in his career. I guess what these artists have in common is that they are not afraid to radically change direction in their output if they find themselves getting bored/boring and just spinning their wheels album after album.  What other artists have maintained decades long careers that for the most part have resulted in high quality music, even if it was good in a different way than their music originally was?","Tom Waits is the obvious answer. Also Scott Walker - if anything, his music massively improved when record labels stopped telling him what to do. EDIT: Mod posted about not giving short answers (sorry!), so I'll add that anyone who's interested in Bowie's later work should definitely check out Scott Walker if they haven't already. The Walker Brothers' *Nite Flights* album from 1978 (particular the first four tracks, which Scott wrote) felt very reminiscient of *Blackstar* to me in a lot of ways - I believe Bowie was a big fan of Scott himself.",181
gptvnp,"Just wondering if people agree or not and why, I feel with his huge subscriber count, Anthony has made many artists that he likes big and his opinion quickly floods social media discussion on albums. and many people take his opinion as their own. Now of course this most likely won't be the case for people on this subreddit, however, for some fans I feel it is. In the age where publications like the NME and Rolling Stones are struggling. TheNeedleDrop is becoming more powerful than them. Just an opinion. &#x200B; I would like to state that I am in no way a Fantano fanboy or whatever, I disagree with probably the majority of his ratings and lots of his opinions, he has a good quality channel and is certainly dedicated and I respect him for that. This post is simply a discussion over what may be an extreme view that this one man has more power than huge publications. Thank you!","I'm about halfway to agreeing with you. The Needle Drop may as well be a minor publication with the way it's situated in the music landscape: people love it, follow it, await its opinions and scores. And it definitely has an effect on how the online internet scene views new releases - there's probably a bump from an especially high score, but I'm thinking particularly of the backlash he seems able to incite toward albums like *Fetch the Bolt Cutters* with a less favourable review. And a lot of his audience probably doesn't overlap with Rolling Stone's demographic or just doesn't want to bother following a music or media outlet like Stereogum or NME or Paste, so he's more accessible to them and has more sway. I'm not a fan of this effect, personally, and I think elevating the status of a single critic like that is pretty arbitrary. That said, I think there's a ceiling on his influence at the time of writing because TND isn't a part of the greater industry establishment. There have been some good threads in the past detailing Pitchfork's incredible clout as tastemakers of the '00s, and I'm going to draw that comparison here again: Pitchfork could end careers. Artists like Black Kids got shafted so badly by scathing reviews that they actually suffered commercially. That's the power Fantano currently lacks. He might be able to give some ups to Yndi Halda or whoever he's positively reviewing, but he's not rocketing them to fame; similarly, he can be one noteworthy critical voice speaking out against a band, but it's not going to tank their record sales. This is a good thing, obviously, but he's never going to have the power to affect non-enthusiast discourse the way the big pillars do unless he becomes one of them.",384

gr7mgf,"I've been listening to The Smile Sessions a lot lately, and i'm so enamored with it. It feels very bold and experimental for '67, and a HUGE leap from Pet Sounds. Brian Wilson was such an innovative producer and composer and a beautiful vocalist.  However, listening to this album, I'm a little conflicted on whether or not this album would have been a big splash if it had been released as planned. There's an argument that the Boys would have been bigger than the Beatles had Smile been released, but it still feels very weird and unconventional for mainstream audiences. But then again, it was the 60's.  I dont know. What do you guys think? I feel like the hype for the band after Good Vibrations was released set up expectations for that type of accessible yet forward thinking songs. And there's not really another rock song like Good Vibes on the album.  I do think it was necessary for Brian to focus on his own health, and i adore this thing. But im interested what everyone has to say.","There's certainly an argument. I've addressed this before a few times, so I won't go into the detail I usually do, but... A big issue with Pet Sounds is that it alienated their old audience. At the same time, it had trouble gaining traction with more critical music fans because it was, well... a Beach Boys album. But the album was a critical success and that's a great start. Then the Beach Boys released Good Vibrations to both critical and commercial success, and gave the Beach Boys some buzz, which they definitely needed if they wanted SMiLE to succeed. Then you have the Monterey Pop Festival. If you are unfamiliar, it's the festival that more or else started the late 60s hippy era. There were many notable performers at the festival who would come to define the late 60s, like Simon & Garfunkel, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, The Who...  The festival also helped launch the careers of both Hendrix and Otis Redding.  As an aside, the concert was filmed by D. A. Pennebaker and released as a movie, and it's now paired with a bonus disc that includes extra performances and the full set for Hendrix and Otis Redding.  It's easily the best concert film of all time and I highly recommend you check it out.  But back to the Beach Boys. They were originally scheduled to headline the Monterey Pop Festival, but they had to drop out.  The Mamas and the Papas took over, and the Summer of Love kicked off while leaving the Beach Boys behind.  But let's say we're in a world where Brian Wilson gets his mental health under control and they play the Monterey Pop Festival and release a completed SMiLE on schedule.  The Beach Boys would start building some initial intrigue with Pet Sounds, then build some buzz with Good Vibrations, and then create genuine excitement by headlining the most important concert of the 1960s, where they debut songs from their upcoming masterpiece...  Thats quite a springboard for SMiLE, arguably the most ambitious album of all time. Could it have changed music? Would it have started a true rivalry with the Beatles? Would we be talking about the Beach Boys as the greatest band of all time instead of the Beatles? Anything is possible. We'll never know for sure, but it's always fun to speculate.",182
grncr0,"I still see all these albums as basically perfect, but I think Animals is the best. It has the most interesting social commentary and I like how angry it sounds. DSotM, while still amazing, is less focused and doesn't go in depth on any of the themes and I personally like both the angrier sound of Animals and the more sorrowful and pessimistic sound of Wish You Were Here more. &#x200B; Edit: I don't know if I made this clear enough when I first posted this, but this is just my opinion. If you say any of these albums are your favorite, I see that as 100% relatable. I just currently enjoy the anger about the political system at the time displayed in Animals, and how the more specific and in-depth themes still remain so relevant. Dark Side of the Moon is still a masterpiece and I wouldn't have been nearly as into music if it wasn't for me getting into that album. I understand that point of view of liking other albums more since all of these were my favorite albums at some point in the past and some days I switch to liking Wish You Were Here more. I didn't include The Wall since I haven't listened to it yet. I'm an ADHD addled Zoomer with no attention span but I understand it's something I should get around to listening to.","[meme response](https://i.imgur.com/aRblt8v.jpg) To be honest, I feel like Animals is just way too samey. Sure Dogs has a multi-part structure... but it just repeats itself in the second half. Three Pigs more or less plods along in the same manner for 12 minutes, barring a bridge somewhere in the middle. So at least 3/4 of the album so far just feels like two 6-8 minute tracks played twice in succession, to say nothing of the two Pigs on the Wings tracks. Dogs fares a bit better, mostly because I think it's more dramatic. So musically, I feel like the only ""golden years"" Pink Floyd album with less ideas is The Final Cut. I'm not sure the album really goes into any greater details in its themes than DSOTM either. It has a few dated references to some British politicians, but it's mostly fairly bland as far as any real commentary goes. What's there is largely just cribbed from Animal Farm anyway, so I'm not sure the band should really get any special kudos for that. So yeah, it's a good album overall, but one that feels like it doesn't have very many ideas, so it just makes up for it by being long.

I have asked them what was the first instrument they learned, what were some of their first musical influences, what are they currently listening to, and much more. I've gotten some pretty unexpected answers like ""I learned how to play clarinet because of squidward"" lol.  I don't know anyone else who enjoys music and learning about the musicians as much as I do. Everyone that I'm close to likes music but could care less about what actually goes into making it.

gv15p4,"I recently got my first pair of headphones now that I'm quarantining in a house with other people and its been a real different experience. Rap sounds much better and all songs just have a lot more detail that I've never noticed before. But for every song that becomes richer and deeper, there's a bunch of songs that sound worse in higher quality. A lot of the extra details I hear are superfluous and detract from the song, although maybe I'm just used to the previous version. Some songs are mixed in ways which only come through on headphones, like music in one ear and voice coming through the other. Like I said, its good for some songs but distracts from others. Many lose their minimalist charm. Some songs don't benefit from lush production or lots of background details.

gvcm00,"When I think of politics in music i generally think of Kurt Cobain because of his feminist and anti-homophobe reputation. There are plenty of other artists out there that have strongly shared their opinions too. Recently i came across a thread about Nirvana and someone was saying that if you dont agree with Kurt Cobain on political matters, you are not fully understanding the music and you ""should not be allowed"" to listen to it. I agree with most of Kurt's political views so this isnt about me, but I think that statement is a very weird thing to say. The comment which stated that had over 20 upvotes and anyone who disagreed was heavily downvoted. Which makes me think people actually believe this. My question for you is, what do you think of musicians intertwining politics into their music? Do listeners have to share beliefs?  I think music should be about whatever the artist believes in, including politics, but imo saying someone has to agree with the artist on every matter or they're ""undeserving"" is unreasonable because you simply cannot agree with every musician you listen to. edit: at first i was trying to reply to everybody but i have gotten busy so ill just say this; thank you guys for interacting with me and each other, and thank you for keeping the discussion interesting. ill try to get back on later and talk some more but if i cant, ill still be reading all your comments. thank you guys!","What I find odd is when there's artists who are *overtly* political, and very clear about those politics, and yet there are people who are fans that disagree with those politics. Like Paul Ryan being a Rage Against the Machine fan while being very much a prime example of the Machine being Raged Against. Or when Roger Waters fan were upset with his last album's political message, apparently having gone 40 years without noticing those same politics rather consistently on display. The basic question in these cases is this: what are they hearing if not the message being *SHOUTED* at them? I wouldn't go so far as to suggest you shouldn't listen to an artist you disagree with, but I do have to wonder why you would.",187
gwjy05,"The guitar solo is a cornerstone of western rock music and covers a full spectrum of styles, emotions, technicality, etc. One thing I've noticed that can really enhance a solo is the ability of the rest of the band to follow the lead of the guitarist. Sometimes this means having a very sparse backing, as in Pink Floyd's [""Shine On You Crazy Diamond""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54W8kktFE_o&t=2m10s), or not playing at all, as in Led Zeppelin's [""Heartbreaker""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwmCOSYUSlI&t=2m2s) (before you say anything, yes I know the solo was recorded separately and added in later; my point still stands). Other times this means starting off low and slow while steadily ramping up the intensity as the solo unfolds, some of my favorite examples being this solo from Television's [""Marquee Moon""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4myghLPLZc&t=4m26s) or this one from King Crimson's [""Sailors Tale""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWZPJTNPXQU&t=2m32s).  What are some other examples of great guitar solos being enhanced by their accompaniment (or lack thereof)? All my examples are from the 70's but any time period or style of music is fine. **EDIT** -- I wanted to mention one more beautiful solo that I can't believe I forgot: Steve Hackett's solo in Genesis' [""Firth of Fifth""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83G2MSQHKzQ&t=5m42s). That's some incredible cohesion.","Maggot Brain has to mentioned here. The simple appregio (am I correct in saying that) guitar part in the background is just high enough in the mix to know it's there, but lets Eddie Hazel be Eddie Hazel and create one of the greatest solos of all time.

To me, it's the greatest solo of all time and it wouldn't be the same without that back up.",65
gxt8mo,"This is a topic I've been suspicious about for a while, but this recent video by Finn McKenty (Punk Rock MBA on Youtube) called [""The Rock & Metal Genre Tier List""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRlUuTgMO7k&t) really solidified my suspicions. Despite the fact that I disagree with him on pretty much everything, I do appreciate his perspective, but this video he did recently really brought to light something I've noticed about how rock music is understood adn talked about depending on what part of rock music you are coming from.  In making his tier list, I noticed the subgenres included seem to focus purely on punk, scene, and metal, as well as general ""active"" rock. Now this is unsurprising considering that this is his channel's focus, but I found it odd that there is a whole other world of rock music that has absolutely no presence on his list. Indie rock, blues rock, Americana rock, post-punk, folk rock, garage rock, or even just straight up alternative rock are just straight up ignored. Normally, I wouldn't think too much of this if it wasn't for the fact that every single ""rock & metal"" YouTuber I have ever come across is the exact same way. That whole other side of rock just seems to be not a part of their idea of what rock music even is. This goes the other way too. Many a ""proper"" music critic, such as the ones who write for Pitchfork or someone like Steven Hyden for example seem to equate rock music fully with ""indie rock,"" ignoring everything that someone like Finn McKenty focuses on. I find this very strange as someone who listens to rock music across the whole spectrum. Why does this divide seem to be so strong to the point where people on one side seem to be completely ignorant of the other side?  This schism is even enforced at the corporate level. There is this event that happened in the late 00s that I like to call ""The Great Divorce of Alternative Rock,"" where the rock radio and industry as a whole broke the term ""alternative rock"" into ""alternative"" and ""rock,"" and overlap between the two worlds started to become very rare, with ""alternative"" focusing on the more indie dounds, and ""rock"" focusing more on the heavier sounds. Overtime this led to these two worlds of rock becoming pretty much entirely separate from one another, with completely different ideas of what rock music even is. ***What do you guys think? What do you think created this huge schism? Why do rock fans of one side generally appear to be completely ignorant of the other side?***",This is a great idea to discuss. I was in disbelief when I found bands like Black Pistol Fire and The Sheepdogs still cranking out excellent rock and roll that I had never heard on the radio.

gydga4,"Let me preface this by saying: I have listened to a LOT of jazz. I love jazz, and I do have favorite styles and compositions that I prefer over others, but I feel like I am lacking a fundamental understanding of jazz music that lets me differentiate between good jazz music and bad jazz music. I have a rudimentary understanding of music theory, but the more complicated stuff--like understanding aspects of the music that differentiate ""Kind of Blue"" and ""Seven Steps to Heaven"" to make the former be considered among the greatest albums of all time and the latter just a footnote in Miles' career--elude me. That's not to say the latter is a bad album per se; they both sound great to me. But then to hear Miles himself disapprove of all the praise lumped onto ""Kind of Blue"" is equally surprising.  There is also a series of interviews where Miles does a blind listen to several jazz records and offers up his criticisms without knowing the players, which provides some insight into the genre that I feel I am totally missing out on. He as picking up and commenting on things like timbre and mood, as well as the musicality of the pieces at an insane level. All that being said, I don't think I've ever sat down with a jazz record and thought ""ew, this is all wrong. He thinks he knows what he's doing, but this is garbage."" It all sounds great to me! And I know it will always sound great to me. I'm not trying to hate anything, but I just want to be able to better understand what makes a jazz album or composition truly great, and what makes a mediocre record. For example, I'm listening to Freddie Hubbard's ""High Energy"" right now, and I think it sounds great. Freddie's tone is top notch as usual, the band is tight, the melodies and arrangements are compelling, and yet this is considered a low point in Freddie's career. I have not yet listened to ""Liquid Love,"" which is supposed to be even worse, but I have a feeling I'll greatly enjoy it as well. Again, I'm not looking to hate anything, I simply want to be able to improve my appreciation and better understand what I am listening to. Not looking for a list of greatest jazz albums or worst jazz albums, but more of a discussion on what makes these albums be considered the ""greatest"" or the ""worst.""","Jazz is very ""rules go out the window"" to start with.  The more rules go out the window, the more left-field things get.  There's no ""Well, to the trained ear..."" argument for this. That being said, if one of the rules is ""ALL the musicians involved should have SOME kind of musical training"" then you could say that  ""Well, I Should Have...

gz9a4k,"I‚Äôve been a fan of R.E.M. for years, and I love their early era. Chronic Town is an outstanding EP, and Murmur, Reckoning & Lifes Rich Pageant are classics. Fables of the Reconstruction is a brilliant (and underrated) effort, as well.  I like how R.E.M. utilized lyrics & vocals. Michael Stipe had such a gentle & comforting voice, and his singing was expressive in a reserved, but sincere way. Michael Stipe‚Äôs vocals were low in the mix; there were times where they were buried, and it was difficult to understand what he was saying. The lyrics were abstract, open-ended phrases that had multiple (if not confusing) interpretations.  Peter Buck was an amazing guitarist, and I like R.E.M.‚Äôs rhythm section (as well as how they applied their influences). Peter Buck is one of my guitar heroes; during R.E.M.‚Äôs early era, (particularly on Murmur & Reckoning) he had a clean, melodic & super-bright style, and his playing took a lot of cues from Roger McGuinn. In general, R.E.M. owed a lot of their style to the Byrds, and Mike Mills‚Äô basslines were fluid, nimble & groovy. Bill Berry understood the art of playing for the song, and R.E.M. mixed the (proto) jangle pop of the Byrds with post-punk. It was apparent that R.E.M. listened to Wire, Talking Heads & Gang of Four. Peter Buck avoided solos, and he demonstrated a lot of restraint.  I love how R.E.M.‚Äôs early era had ambiguous elements. Chronic Town through Fables of the Reconstruction featured jangle pop that was mysterious, enigmatic & otherworldly; the obscured vocals & unusual lyrics added a lot to the mystery, and R.E.M.‚Äôs songs felt like treasures that required multiple listens to get into.  Document is very good, but it‚Äôs obvious that R.E.M. changed their sound on that record.

h0hj7i,"Disclaimer - I realize the current social climate is very tense regarding race, for very good reason. Just to be clear I'm not meaning for this to be disparaging in any way, nor am I an expert. Just observations by me trying to start a discussion. In recently reading some articles and skimming playlists, as well as my own general knowledge of popular music, I've noticed an interesting/strange phenomenon. Black musicians, especially in America, had a very primary role in the creation of rock and roll music. From the early 20th century blues and soul musicians that laid the groundwork, into the 50's with artists like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, BB King and Muddy Waters, they served as early pioneers for the sound. A sound which white artists like Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Buddy Holly would work with and popularize. However, from that point forward, it seems like for the most part, black musicians strayed from rock into other genres. With notable exceptions like Jimi Hendrix, most popular black artists in the 60's and 70's seem to have explored genres like R&B, soul, funk, disco, whereas most notable rock from that era comes from white musicians. That trend continued into the 80's and 90's, with a few exceptions. Bad Brains were a big inspiration in 80s hardcore punk, and Living Colour in the hard rock scene. Slash from Guns n' Roses. The 90's had Lenny Kravitz and Rage Against the Machine. And a few alternative rock bands in the 2000's featured black singers, like TV On The Radio, Alabama Shakes, and Bloc Party. But overwhelmingly, from the 80s forward, as hip hop started to take form and r&b dominated in the mainstream, black musicians as a whole have tended to gravitate towards these genres rather than rock or its related subgenres, a trend which has continued until now. So how did this happen? Black people essentially created rock music in the 50's and earlier, but as it grew in popularity, they seem to have moved away from the genre into other styles. Why didn't artists like Jimi influence more black kids to play rock? Again, please let me know if I'm off base here. I'm no ""authority"", just curious why this may be the case &#x200B; EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not claiming that there haven't been black rock artists over the years. Just that as a whole, the most relevant and popular black artists made music outside of rock from the 60s until now, although the genre has black roots. Whereas the most influential and popular rock music from that time period was predominantly made by white people","You should check out the book Just Around Midnight by Jack Hamilton. I found it super interesting and very well written. From the description on GoodReads: >By the time Jimi Hendrix died in 1970, the idea of a black man playing lead guitar in a rock band seemed exotic. Yet a mere ten years earlier, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley had stood among the most influential rock and roll performers. Why did rock and roll become ""white""? *Just around Midnight* reveals the interplay of popular music and racial thought that was responsible for this shift within the music industry and in the minds of fans.",322

haviza,"Ready to Die has been long considered a hip-hop classic, but I wonder if people truly understand what makes it a great album. Sure you have classic tracks, 90s east coast production and one of the slickest MCs to ever pick up a mic, but, for me, it's the message that makes Ready To Die a seminal album. From the intro track we are given a scattered view of Biggie's life from birth to drug dealing to making it big time. For 16/17 tracks you could easily come away with the idea that Biggie is glorifying a life style that revolves around guns, drugs, violence and pussy. In fact, growing up many of my friends liked this album for that very reason. 'Things Done Changed' and 'Gimmie the Loot' come to mind as songs people enjoy for their 'hardness'. I guess my point is that most people don't seem take track 17 into account. Biggie basically calls a friend, tells him everything he's been rapping about the whole time has filled him with guilt and unhappiness, and then he shoots himself. End of album. Hard to argue he's glorifying the thug life when you take the whole album in context. Songs like 'Juicy' and 'Big Poppa' just seem sad or at the very least less fun.  Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon with this particular album? Maybe some others come to mind? Am i totally off base? Seemed like an interesting discussion.","there is definitely a depressed/melancholy side to Biggie and especially this album that doesn't get remarked upon much. here are some choice lyrics as evidence  ""Back in the days our parents used to take care of us   Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us""  ""Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?   Every time I turn around, a nigga gettin' took out   Shit, my mama got cancer in her breast   Don't ask me why I'm motherfucking stressed, things done changed"" ""And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem   It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture   Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya"" ""Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl   My life is played out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to die!"" the last one is particularly striking - very far-off from the cliched idea of rap braggadocio",121

hf2y2n,"A friend told me that sometimes he completely stops listening to music for a few weeks, then when he gets back to music it sounds much better.  I've done the same with other things such as weed, and the effects were legitimate. I even noticed that if I stopped watching football (soccer) for a few months, then I'm much more impressed by the players' skills. For a while, my playlist seemed pretty dry and I just didn't enjoy my favourites anymore, so I tried taking a break. I didn't listen to any music for a week. There's not much they could be done to avoid TikToks, commercials etc but I didn't put on a pair of headphones except to listen to podcasts.  It was pretty easy. I listen to 2-3h music per day usually, but I didn't experience any cravings. I did ""miss"" music though, since quarantine was pretty boring. When I finally put on my headphones after a week, I put on a playlist that I compiled throughout the week, and I sat down on a comfy chair and just listened. It sounded pretty good! I listened for about 2 hours without really getting tired of the music. The playlist had a lot of genres and every song was enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed aggressive songs like DROP by DaBaby or 99 by The Haunted. But I'm not sure if it actually made a difference, since there were a number of other factors that could have played into it, namely:  -Placebo effect. I could've thought it's better simply because I assumed it to be true. -I just sat down and listened to music with no other task in hand, so there were no distractions. -I was much more observant because I wanted to feel the effects. Being more mindful could've enhanced my experience. -The playlist I made was full of my favourite songs, so maybe I just liked the playlist a lot.   I'd say taking a break had about 50% of the effect that I would've expected. Has anybody done anything similar? Is it worth taking a longer break, like a month?","i go through phases of audio oversaturation. especially if i'm binging on a particular artist/album. it can be compulsive to constantly listen but i think it's a very healthy thing to do. when i go back to music, i even crave new genres to listen to. that's how i got into black metal. but too much of anything can be overwhelming for a long period of time and taking breaks in any activity can illicit a kind of discipline",148
hg9jyw,"Arguments can be made for Ghostface's *Iron Man,* Old Dirty Bastard's *Return to the 36 Chambers* and Method Man's *Tical*. One of my mates swears by *Wu-Tang Forever*. But as a general rule of thumb, discussions regarding which Wu-Tang album is the best boils down to their debut, the GZA's *Liquid Swords* and Raekwon's *Only Built 4 Cuban Linx*. I've been in a Wu-mood lately and ended up listening to all three, one after the other. In the end what struck me the most wasn't their comparative merit- instead, I was thrown by how incredibly different these albums are in terms of mood, tone and sound. They all have that ""Wu"" feel, but they take that feel to very different places. &#x200B; First up was *36 Chambers*, which was probably most people's introduction to the group. I can't imagine what hearing this in 1993 must have been like. I still remember my first listen when I was on a road trip in 2012:  ""*Shaolin shadowboxing, and the Wu-Tang sword style/ If what you say is true/The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous""*, followed by the RZA's cathartic screams of ""*Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!""* Much like the kung-fu movies that inspired it, this album recognises hyperbolic violence as a source of fun and thrilling entertainment. I tend to get bored when second-rate rappers brag about shooting people up: *36 Chambers'* brand of violence is way more brutal and silly, threatening to beat you with a spiked bat and stick pins in your head. Piling on to the fun are the ridiculous number of pop culture references: everything from Spider-Man to *The Twilight Zone.* And yet all this silliness doesn't negate from the depth of the record. It just sounds like a load of guys having a ridiculous amount of fun, but just because they know how to have fun doesn't mean they don't have problems too. *Tearz* and *C.R.E.A.M.* painfully reveal why these young men needed escapism more than most. &#x200B; Up next was *Liquid Swords*, which incidentally is Chris Rock's favourite Wu album. In the past I've considered it the clearest sequel to *36 Chambers*, but after playing them side-by-side I'm no longer so sure. *36 Chambers* is a mad, chaotic funplex; *Liquid Swords* is much more sombre and serious, and it's way more invested in world building. To listen to it is to step into a stylised version of Staten Island in the 90s- in a way it reminds of listening to Biggie's *Ready To Die* or Nas' *Illmatic*, which constructed their own versions of Brooklyn and Queens respectively. I suppose I always considered it a sequel because of its kung-fu samples, but these are utilised in a very different manner to *36 Chambers*. Before, they were another fun element the RZA was throwing in: here, they feel uncanny and uncomfortable. There's something unsettling about hearing piss-poor voice actors describe such unpleasant acts of violence:  ""When cut across the neck, a sound like wailing winter winds is heard, they say. I'd always hoped to cut someone like that someday, to hear that sound."" I feel like this was deliberate: this was the first Wu album where I really appreciated the RZA's craftsmanship, and I love the way he pushes the eeriness of his old samples. Were there any beats in 1995 that sounded as bizarre as ""Living in the World Today"" or ""4th Chamber""? Then there's my favourite, the grinding guitars of ""Swordsman"", also a showcase for the lyrical genius of The GZA: *""We were on the same ship when the slaves were checked/ I had to pull your card you was on the top deck/So I plotted my escape, I saw the thin line between love and hate/ And fast from the hog on the plate/I suffered brutal pains, from whips and chains/Punishments that were set to wash the brain"".* He's always been the wordiest member of the Clan, and I feel like only he could have balanced the world building, wordplay and serious tone of *Liquid Swords*. &#x200B; Finally, there's *Only Built for Cuban Linx*. I'll confess, for the longest time I didn't ""get"" this album. I'd heard it was their most ""gangsta"" and tried to digest it as such. It wasn't until I returned to it a few years after my first listen realised: this is actually the Wu at their most experimental, wild and raw when compared to the structured *Liquid Swords;* avant-garde compared to the chaotic but tight *36 Chambers*. The raps come as bombastic streams of consciousness from Ghostface and Raekwon that are nearly impossible to keep up with: \*""\**Lay on the crime scene, sipping fine wines,* *pulling nines on/ UFOs taking they fly clothes, they eyes closed/ We getting loot, no doubt, check the word of mouth/ Unheard about, guns go off and now I murder route.""* And the beats... holy shit, the beats! ""Ice Water"" might just be my favourite beat ever, but my appreciation for the RZA doubled when I heard the source of its sample:  [https://www.whosampled.com/sample/24120/Raekwon-Ghostface-Killah-Cappadonna-Ice-Water-Delores-Hall-Where-Do-We-Go-From-Here%3F/](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/24120/Raekwon-Ghostface-Killah-Cappadonna-Ice-Water-Delores-Hall-Where-Do-We-Go-From-Here%3F/)  The RZA took a few seconds of 70s soul and reworked it into the toughest, weirdest gangsta shit ever. My other favourite beat on the album is ""Verbal Intercourse"", which pulls a similar trick. So yeah, *Cuban Linx* was hugely influential on mafioso rap- but I would argue that it's far more intangible and wordy than any of its descendants, with music that was too strange for anyone to try and imitate. Now that I understand its vibe, I feel it's definitely worthy of its place in the Wu canon. &#x200B; So all three of these are stone cold classics, to the point where it actually ceases to be fun to try and weigh them against each other: like I said before, they're all so different. But ultimately I think the chemistry between the RZA and the GZA on *Liquid Swords* just about gives that album the top spot: I'd argue it could go toe-to-toe with any gangsta rap album you care to name. *36 Chambers* beats *Cuban Linx* by an Old Dirty Bastard, who doesn't appear on the latter. But as a whole, they represent the holy trinity of the Wu, the finest hip hop collective to walk the Earth. Which Wu-Tang album do you guys think is the best? Penny for your thoughts?","I appreciate this breakdown, but I see 36 Chambers as being in a separate category from the solo-debut albums.  36 Chambers was RZA's vision for the Wu Tang Clan (as a whole) whereas: Liquid Swords, Cuban Linx, Return to the 36th Chamber, Ironman & Tical was more of RZA working with each of the members of the clan individually, to actualize their visions for a debut album. &#x200B; Wu is a single group but each of the individual members are so unique from one another stylistically. This comes across clearly to anyone who listens to the debut albums. RZA as the Executive Producer for all the debut solo albums is largely responsible for actualizing their visions and highlight the artists individual personas to the public at large. &#x200B; (Cuban Linx is my all-time favorite album)",39
hgo0v6,"Personally I don‚Äôt see the appeal, live recordings aren‚Äôt able to capture the atmosphere and brilliance of studio versions and it just leaves me wanting more. I‚Äôll admit, some artists are fantastic live (Radiohead, Pink Floyd etc.) and I can see the appeal in them, but at the end of the day I always prefer the original songs. The way I look at it, the studio versions are exactly what the artists intended to create, it‚Äôs in their eyes (in most cases) the best version of their work.  So what about them makes it worth listening to over the studio versions?","There's a Lou Reed interview where he talks about the Sweet Jane riff, and mentions that the recorded riff just happened to be the version that they chose to play that take. What I'm trying to illustrate with this is that the recorded version of a song isn't the only version of the song out there, and that sometimes people prefer live versions because they get to hear songs in the version that they prefer. If you ever listen to jam bands, you'll really notice that a lot of times, the live versions of the songs tend to be favored over the originals because they give the band the freedom to experiment and mess around that they might not have when the producer and label are breathing down their necks in the studio. Also, sometimes people don't think that the studio version is the best version of a song. For example, some people prefer live recordings of Joy Division over the studio versions because they prefer the band's originally faster, scrappier sound to the more cold and austere sound that Martin Hammett was pushing them to make in the studio.  Ultimately, it's all just a matter of personal preference. Some people like Sweet Jane simple and punky, so they listen to the studio version on Loaded. Other people like it big and complex, so they listen to the 8 minute long Rock And Roll Animal version, with the crazy intro. At the end of the day, it's all just opinion and taste.",214
hhfkeo,"I've seen this response far too often online, where someone brings up how they don't like an artist's style or think something negative about them. Then they nearly always have someone respond saying they must be jealous. Surely if you think an artist makes great music you'd be a fan instead of shitting on them right? This is especially common when the artist in question makes, let's call it more progressive music. When someone declares they just aren't into that particular sound along with the above assumption it's also assumed ""You just don't get it"" or ""You just wish *you* could play like that."" To me this is a very strange reaction since music tastes vary so wildly and not everyone can think your favourite artist is the musical genius you see them as.","It's just one of those dumb things people say when someone dares to ""criticise"" their taste and they're too insecure to accept it. I don't think saying ""you just don't get it"" is the same as calling someone jealous though, although it's almost as dumb in most cases.",118
hhpxqw,"Incredible! These guys released their arguably best albums,  and then never played them live. What do you think that means? How would The Beatles have pulled off doing all their craziness live? Could this be one of the reasons they were able to produce such high quality material during this period?  I feel like their decision to stop touring was a great one and quite possibly why they were really able to experiment and become one of the greatest rock bands ever and more than just a fad. Touring might have forced them into stagnation, and perhaps intensified some of the personality clashes they have been known to share.  What do you think?",They retired from playing live because the crowds were so insanely loud the band could no longer hear themselves on stage. I think all that time in the studio definitely lead to them pushing boundaries and creating some amazing art. I doubt it would have played out the same way had they continued touring regularly.,196
hk8zdd,"Technology has driven music trends as much as anything.   From the electric guitar, multi-tracking, conversion to FM radio, music videos etc.  I have no facts to back it up but I‚Äôm sure the majority of people now listen to their music alone with earbuds.   Current music (of which I‚Äôm absolutely not an expert) seems to be quieter, more personally emotional and intimate.  That sort of mournful Billie Eilish style that seems so popular now. There‚Äôs a perceived connection there when the music is flooding into your ears alone.  Do you think (if I‚Äôm right about that at all) that earbuds have driven current pop music to be quieter?  More intimate?","I have a bit to talk about relating to earbuds. Firstly, the girl vocalists in EDM. They don't want the male vocalists to get lost in the mids in low quality speakers. Songs such as KOAN Sound - Grounded sound completely different on good headphones. But Ellie Goulding - Close to Me will sound similar. In Roses - Imanbek Remix they upped the pitch of the male vocals really high so they would resolve on overblown car speakers. Really smart. Notice how in most hip hop tracks they remove most of the instrumentals so you can hear the autotuned rapper. Second is bass. Most earbuds have no bass. Yeah, you can get good sennheisers or sonys and have rockin' bass in your earbuds, but most people just buy what's trendy. Billie Eilish is popular because it has a completely overblown, muddy bassline that comes across the same way across everyone's terrible speakers. Hearing the bass properly in SG Lewis - Chemicals requires actual headphones. Speaking of bass, cheap earbuds are likely to mute a lot of sub-bass elements in something like Riot - Jackknife. To play that song at appreciable volume on speakers you'd need a decent subwoofer, the likes of which the vast majority of people don't have. Metal songs as well aren't popular because of the earbud bass problem. Last is mids: Notice how Post Malone and Blackbear make songs with a lot of reverb? That's to prevent their voices from sounding tinny in those cheap earbuds. I'm not gonna go on about mids. It's not that complicated just go to the pair and try a good set of headphones.",70
hlrgrh," A somewhat odd question to ask, but there it is- how long do you like your albums? To me, around 39-45 minutes is perfect. 50 minutes is okay too, but anything more starts wearing me out, especially if the album is bloated with tons of filler. One of the few exceptions is Pink Floyd's The Wall, which does have filler, but since the album kind of tells a story, i'm fine with sitting through it. It's not half bad filler either. &#x200B; An offender would be Radiohead's Hail To The Thief, at nearly an hour long. I love that album with all my heart- it's high points are among Radiohead's highest- but it's low points are also among Radiohead's worst. There's at least 4 or 5 tracks I could name right off the bat that could've just been B-sides (The Gloaming, We suck young blood, Scatterbrain etc). It would have been a way more concise album without those, and I feel, could even contend among Radiohead's finest work. Hell, even Thom Yorke himself released an alternate tracklist for it. &#x200B; Anyway, what about you guys?","Some albums merit more than others. I'd normally agree around 45 minutes, but I've heard 90 minute lengths that kept med captivated all the way through. Problem with those is more finding time to just listen to it through.",169
hmk2a2,"Sad to say that Ennio Morricone has passed away today. He has made some of the most memorable film scores in movie history. Even some of his lesser-known works are pretty good. This brings me to what I think is one of the most inexplicable trends in 80's post-punk/new wave: Certain gothic rock bands having a strange fixation on the wild west. The earliest example I can think of is Southern Death Cult with Ian Astbury's Native American-inspired image and their Morricone-ish guitar riffs. Theatre of Hate's debut album was titled ""Westworld"" and the music is very similar to Morricone's scores in some places. Red Lorry Yellow Lorry dropped an album called ""Paint Your Wagon"". And of course, Fields of the Nephilim took the gothic wild west thing to it's logical conclusion. So what was the reason for 80's gothic rock bands having a fixation on the wild west and Morricone scores? I honestly don't have a clue.","I think there‚Äôs also the influence of surf rock that‚Äôs being forgotten a little. What made Morricone‚Äôs scores for the Dollars Trilogy so unique was that it wasn‚Äôt a conventional orchestra: he relied on whistles, chants, the occasional Mariachi-style horn, and, of course, an electric guitar that had a surf-rock twang to it (and of course, courtesy of Dick Dale‚Äôs Middle Eastern influences, surf rock tended to borrow a bit from Spanish music). I think people raised on Spaghetti Westerns would still have incorporated the imagery if they enjoyed the movies, but had the soundtrack been more conventional, like something out of a Howard Hawks western, I doubt that gothic rock artists would be borrowing from him. But it just so happened that gothic rock, with its twangy, shimmery guitar notes, happened to be pulling from a similar sound that Morricone was, so the influence was natural.",40

hp91tc,"Stevie Wonder, a blind man, is undoubtedly a musical genius. Wonder was already considered a genius during his prodigy years in the 60s and he went on to create many innovate and socially conscious works during his career, most notably during the 70s when he had his ""classic period"". Three consecutive albums of his during that period all won a Grammy Album of the Year award; back when Grammy's were actually prestigious. Based on that success, he arguably had the greatest musical run of all time, however, I feel like he does not get the praise he deserves within ""music culture"". When it comes to who is music ""royalty"", it's often Elvis, Beatles and Michael Jackson who are regarded as the pinnacle of music. Wonder undoubtedly should be mentioned...he's arguably the most talented artist out of those of three.",I‚Äôve never met anyone who saw wonder as anything other than a member of the pantheon of greatest artists of all time.

hs21qt,"Hi, everyone. I just wanted to say that Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sigur Ros were stellar bands. I love both of them so much, and I‚Äôve turned into a big fan of Sigur Ros recently. I just wanted to talk about what made them into amazing bands.  I love the power of their music. GY!BE was great at creating epics that had huge scopes. A lot of GY!BE‚Äôs music is instrumental, but their songs had a lot of emotion. GY!BE covered fear, rage, sadness, euphoria and joy, and GY!BE‚Äôs music succeeded at being emotionally expressive in a big way. Sigur Ros went for beautiful, ethereal soundscapes that had massive crescendos, and their music had so much purity and hope.  GY!BE and Sigur Ros are unique, as well. In addition to long songs, Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven has a runtime of 87+ minutes, and the vinyl version of F#A# Infinity is a testament to the apocalypse. GY!BE have recorded grand songs with elements of classical music, and Sigur Ros went for an otherworldly, heavenly sound that had lengthy songs & extravagant production.  I love how GY!BE & Sigur Ros defined post-rock, as well as their incorporations of various genres. GY!BE definitely went into noise rock, and they‚Äôve covered the genres of noise and drone, along with bits of post-hardcore. Sigur Ros focused on dream pop, ambient, shoegaze and art rock, and both of them demonstrated what post-rock could turn into. I think that GY!BE and Sigur Ros exemplified the epic qualities of post-rock, as well as its emotional expressiveness.","What do you mean were?  Both of those bands are still around. Godspeed You! Black Emperor is one of my all time favorite bands and one of the most memorable live shows that I have ever seen. Fucking incredible, love everything they do.",92
humxng,"I honestly don't know if it's just depression or too much doomscrolling, but I am anxious about live music never coming back. Important venues in the UK have begun to close for good and venues in the US are hanging on by a thread. Bands are being candid about how much this is costing them and about how without live shows they can't survive much longer. Friends of mine who work as crew (lighting, sound, guitar techs) are either getting out of the industry all together or saying their companies are worried that live music even NEXT summer won't be a thing. Another year of cancelled music festivals.  Live music is really all I have. It's where I see my friends, where I get my weekly shot of serotonin. It's like church to me. Being pressed against the barrier, the bass reverberating in your bones, the guitar so loud you can feel your fillings rattling. The interaction you get when you're tossed a pick or a drum stick. The communal experience of being in a pit with everyone, singing and moving. It's something I miss so, so badly.  I know some bands are trying to do live shows on Zoom or Facebook or whatever and, as much as I love them and want to support them, it's not the same. I feel bad but paying $20 to see Nick Cave in an empty theater on my phone is just such a shitty, depressing way to interact with music. I don't begrudge any band for trying to make money any way they can right now and I've donated money and bought merch to try and help out. But something about paying money to see a glorified youtube concert video just makes me so fucking sad.  I've written my congressman and senator to Save Our Stages. I've bought merch from bands I love. I've donated money to funds for their road crews or to keep the lights on at places I love. I kept all the tickets for the postponed shows I was going to go to this year instead of getting refunds. I literally don't know what else to do. I am so sick with worry that this will never come back. Lie-awake-at-night worried. My favorite venues might close for good, my favorite bands may never tour again. What do I even do with myself now? At some point, I'm just starting to realize that nothing is worth it nowadays. I'm not doing great physically or mentally and everything I enjoy is indefinitely on hold with the specter of them never coming back or coming back in a weird way (drive in concerts? Socially distanced pits? Fuck no) just kills me. I just had to get this off my chest. Living just doesn't seem worthwhile anymore. I miss going to shows and I miss being in the pit with my friends.

hvhy2m,"I always heard people talk about how upbeat and stuff music in the early 2010s was, and how it became darker as the decade progressed.

hvpjyy,"Mine would have to be what if Buddy Holly lived? He was already getting more experimental and had a head start on The Beatles, who he was a huge influence on. I think its possible he would've taken Rock and Pop in totally different directions, or at least brought certain things to us earlier. There might not even had been a British Invasion if he were around. My second choice would be what if Jim Croce had lived, since his career was incredibly short and he could've ended up on the level of Bob Dylan or John Prine. He's mostly known for his ""Tough guy in Chicago gets surprisingly beat up"" songs which is a shame. You Don't Mess Around with Jim and Bad Bad Leroy Brown are great, but Operator and a ton of his deeper cuts blow them out of the water.

hw01fp,"Like a lot of people I first was exposed to Meat Puppets via Nirvana's covers of [""Lake of Fire,"" ""Plateau,"" and ""Oh Me""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5LtSKKr7oY) on their famous MTV Unplugged album. When I was ~10 years old I remember mishearing Cobain as saying ""That was a song by The Wheat Puppets"" and not being able to find them on iTunes hahaha (this was back in the days before quality music streaming).  Anyhow, their second album ""II"" is something that I was initially turned off by. Hearing nasally, whiny vocals, and eclectic guitar riffs based around an interesting mix of blue grass, folk, rock, and DIY / lofi was in stark contrast to Nirvana's more mainstream interpretations and arrangements performed for MTV Unplugged (though the Meat Puppets actually were featured as backing musicians for Nirvana during the MTV performances). But as I listened to it more and more over the years it reallyyy grew on me. In fact, these days I actually prefer the original versions of [""Oh Me""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4cK0Bsl1wA) and [""Plateau""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0IWHxvswLk).  One of the things that really draws me to Meat Puppets is their lyricism: >I knew a lady who came from Duluth >Got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth >Went to 'er grave just a little too soon, >An' flew away howlin' on the yellow moon. -- ""Lake of Fire"" The imagery in this verse and the [bizarrely smooth flow of the final line](https://youtu.be/9jPglNrZhkA?t=24) really strike me. I also love how the words in the final line kind of mesh together after starting out the verse with a kind of awkward vocal delivery.  The other thing I love about this album is how organic it sounds. It's borderline outsider music *in terms of the vocal delivery* and performances. The vocals are supported by loose, rhythmic guitar licks and minimalist percussion (I think that ""Plateau"" really showcases this aesthetic).  And beyond the songs that Nirvana chose to cover, there are a lot of [interesting deeper cuts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buQeBhrYfrg).  The album is overall really chill and intriguing with rich layering and charming performances. Clocking in at just under 31 minutes, it's a borderline EP. However I think that it's easily Meat Puppets' best work, followed by their album [Too High To Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ieRd4wElWg) as a distant second.  If you've never checked out this album I highly recommend giving it a proper listen from beginning to end. It might take a couple of listens before it ""clicks"" but it's well worth the effort.","The follow-up album, Up on the Sun, is also very much worth your time.

I think the record is incredibly bold and impressive when considered within the context of Taylor Swift's career trajectory but I'm not sure it's really that amazing when evaluated without considering who its creator is. Taylor's musical evolution is unprecedented; very few country artists ever evolve into a global pop stars and very few pop starlets ever attempt to become indie songstresses during the pinnacle of their popularity; you have to respect Taylor's willingness to challenge her audience and experiment with genre but I honestly don't think this record would elicit much attention from mainstream audiences, or the indie community, if it wasn't coming from Taylor Swift. Most of the songs are devoid of infectious hooks, so mainstream listeners wouldn't be interested in the record, and I suspect a lot of haughty indie listeners would find the minimalistic arrangements listless and criticize the lyrics for being juvenile. I think that that every other album Taylor Swift has released, if it had been here debut, would have garnered attention and launched a career; if this was Swift's first release, I'm not sure it generates a fanbase or gets any attention outside of a song like Invisible String maybe being used in an episode of Grey's Anatomy. Do you think that folklore's success is due the album actually being a tremendous indie record or do you think it's primarily being praised because it represents such a starling artistic evolution for its maker? Also, do you think that the cultural zeitgeist, modern media landscape, and pandemic is fueling its rave reviews? Do you believe critics are afraid of denouncing a Taylor Swift album because of her passionate and aggressive fanbase and the current political landscape? Wouldn't any reviewer who criticized the album be met with an avalanche of threats and attacks on social media? Wouldn't a male critic who gave the album a low score, but who had previously praised male indie records that had a similar sonic aesthetic to folklore, be excoriated and labeled a misogynist? Is the record being slightly overrated because we're in a pandemic and aching for some type of major communal artistic experience? Without summer blockbusters, many major album releases, etc. are we're starved for pieces of art that feel culturally and socially significant? Is folklore's effusive praise really just a reflection of our desire to be able to positively connect with people over a piece of art during a time when human connection is extremely challenging?","First of all, that was a fantastic write up. Secondly, I feel that Taylor Swift‚Äôs massive (and aggressive) fanbase are much to thank for the sweeping success of folklore. Taylor Swift‚Äôs fans are a different breed; one that will spread anything she does like wildfire and praise every move that she makes. I would be willing to say she has one of the most established fanbases in the entire industry at the moment. If this was her debut, she would definitely be attracting an entirely different lot of fans. I would honestly be willing to bet that folklore is a lot of people‚Äôs first foray into the indie singer/songwriter style of music. I doubt a lot of Taylor‚Äôs fans would normally listen to such an album, but the fact that it was made by Taylor Swift is what brings them in.",87
hyrsro,"I was reading [this article](https://libcom.org/blog/music-stagnating-are-neoliberalism-gig-economy-blame-16072017) and it got me thinking about something that‚Äôs been happening for quite some time. Most of you would probably agree with me if I said there hasn‚Äôt been a lot of progress in music in the last couple of decades. Rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll, psychedelic rock, jazz fusion, krautrock, disco, punk, synthpop, house, techno, grunge, just to name a few, all appeared at some point between 1960 and 1990. Compare it to the last 30 years between 1990 and now. A cultural theorist Mark Fisher believes that capitalism, or more precisely, neoliberalism is to blame. He argues that ‚Äúneoliberal capitalism has gradually but systematically deprived artists of the resources necessary to produce the new‚Äù. Another writer, Simon Reynolds in his book *Retromania* credits the lower-middle-class/upper-working class with lots of creative energy. However, art schools have been *re-bourgeoised* and now they are out of reach for those of humble background. ""The elimination of student housing and unemployment benefits, the decline of the squatter's movement, and the elimination of affordable rents in the West's traditional cultural centers have all played a role in the current musical stagnation"". The main aim of neoliberalism is to make a profit, hence companies are less willing to take risks. Coupled with major changes in the production and distribution of music, it is obvious that musicians are making less money today ‚Äì there isn‚Äôt much money in the music industry these days. Spotify pays out on average somewhere between $.006 and $.0084 per stream. On top of that, instead of focusing on their art, they are often forced to tirelessly self-promote on social media as well as touring relentlessly. It's not surprising that there isn‚Äôt much time for creativity and innovation. Thinking about this stagnation provokes a bigger question: is neoliberalism here to stay? Has our future, in the words of Mark Fisher, been cancelled? (I would really recommend you to read his books, he‚Äôs an amazing writer!) I want to start a discussion because I believe it is a topic that has huge potential. What do you think about the current situation in the music industry? Do you agree that musical innovation is stagnating under neoliberal capitalism? Also, do you believe that innovation is necessary at all? And finally, do you have any thoughts/ideas about how it could be changed? The future looks bleak at the moment but I hope it is all temporary. Thank you very much, looking forward to your replies! Edit: I must add that I'm mainly talking about the stagnation of the mainstream/corporate music just to make it clear. Edit 2: Thanks for the silver, kind stranger! <3 Edit 3: Thank you for the Cool Summer award, another kind stranger! :) Didn't expect the post to blow up so much!","I would agree that in the last 30 years the condensation and corporatization of the music industry has led to less and less truly revolutionary music. That's not to say there isn't any, but it isn't popular in the way it used to be. It's curious to me, and deeply ironic, that the way the Beatles changed music and brought more artistic music to the front is, I would argue, what brought us to this point.",149
hz6jgv,"I have a good friend who is a longtime Ween head. We have pretty different core musical tastes to begin with, but still a decent amount in common. Were it not for hanging out with him I probably wouldn't be very familiar with Ween at all, and am actually glad to have more exposure.  He is REALLY into them, his favorite band.  This is not a knock on ween, only me being lost. Beyond all intellectual descriptions of Ween, I still don't understand on some base level where they are coming from or where they lie. That may be part of the appeal but to me there seems an odd disconnect between the silly happy stuff and the almost sarcastic darker bits. Almost like two completely separate bands. To me it just sounds directionless.  Hope I didn't offend anyone or anything.","Ween crop up surprisingly frequently on this sub, so it's with some trepidation I write the same comment I have a couple of times before; I find myself at the same time both massively frustrated and massively impressed by Ween's refusal to take themselves seriously.

hzt0mu,"Hey, guys. I‚Äôve listened to Cocteau Twins recently, and I really like their music. Cocteau Twins are a fantastic band, and their sound is groundbreaking; what they did in the 80s did a lot to emphasize dreamy content with rock instruments, and Cocteau Twins truly had a distinctive style.  Robin Guthrie is one of my guitar heroes. He wasn‚Äôt a super-technical player, but his approach to the guitar is something else. I love those ethereal, atmospheric & lush tones that he had, and his guitar work was bathed in reverb & effects. Robin Guthrie‚Äôs style is spellbinding, as he truly demonstrated how the guitar could be a beautiful instrument. Robin Guthrie‚Äôs guitar work has a heavenly vibe, as well. I really like how he occasionally used noise in an overpowering, gorgeous way.  Elizabeth Fraser‚Äôs vocals are incredible! What a singer. I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs saying most of the time, but her powerful, acrobatic vocals added so much to Cocteau Twins‚Äô music. The way that her vocals danced around the music, displaying so much confidence & agility....I love it!  Simon Raymonde is a great bassist, as well, and I love Cocteau Twins‚Äô aesthetic. Cocteau Twins made *beautiful* music, and their songs were silky & mysterious. The production has so many layers, and Cocteau Twins‚Äô exquisite style pioneered dream pop. Cocteau Twins usually has an extravagant, otherworldly vibe that stressed the mood of their music.  Cocteau Twins have a good amount of diversity; they did gothic rock, post-punk & neo-psychedelia, and several of their songs fell into the ‚Äúproto-shoegaze‚Äù category. Cocteau Twins‚Äô music has this graceful, dizzying approach to psychedelia that I really like, and some of their stuff featured a celestial, dark take on post-punk.  Cocteau Twins are great!

Thanks for the comments, guys!",im finding it really funny that ‚Äúheaven or las vegas‚Äù is semi-blowing up on tiktok right now. great to see some of The Youth^tm enjoying some really great music :‚Äô),59
i0122y,"I've been a fan and sometimes poster on LetsTalkMusic, and I love reading all about speculations about where the industry and sounds are headed in the next few years, or what new genres may come about soon. But I don't think there's a balance between these types of topics (or hypothetical ones like ""If Kurt Cobain lived, would Nirvana still be a band?"") and posts reviewing/analyzing songs and albums. I'm active on r/TrueFilm, and the majority of posts on there are about themes of specific movies and contain some really deep analyses. I love seeing new viewpoints and mediations on art, and that sub is a prime example. It has its share of speculative posts, but the balance is closer. So I suppose my question I'm asking all of you here is this: do certain forms of art lend themselves to analysis more than others? Using film as an example, one can analyze the acting, directing, use of color, cinematography,  writing, score, set design, costume design, and composition among other things. In music, you have the production, mixing, instruments, playing style, vocals, lyrics, and album artwork. There's still a lot to discuss, but is visual art easier to dissect/form hypothesis about than sonic art? I know for me talking about visual art is easier to an extent. Reading Pitchfork, I'm always shocked by how many reviews focus on everything surrounding a specific artist/album (the cultural significance, the upbringing of the artist, the fanbase of the artist) but rarely focus on the music, sounds and innovations present on the album at hand. I've noticed that topics on songs/albums on this sub generate noticeably less discussions than the bigger picture music industry threads. What are your guys thoughts on this? Do you want to see more write-ups on why songs/albums sound good, fit a certain mood/theme or why they work sonically?","I'm actually very interested in this sort of content. Interested enough that I make it myself, albeit with a pretty niche audience in mind. I'd love to see more stuff like that here, especially stuff outside of the ""canon"" of stuff that usually gets discussed.",62
i09tnl,"I understand that one of the goals of art is to provide a medium for interpretation, in a way that can only be personal. So, in the same way as a piece of poetry, the lyrics of a song can have a different meaning depending on who's interpretating it. This variety of interpretations is in the essence of art, and it's really beautiful. In a way, Genius annotations are like that. But at the same time not. I can't help but feel slightly dumber when I read into the annotations of some songs I like. Not because they disagree with my interpretation, but because they seem to be painfully overthinked. The thing is: so as a piece of poetry, the lyrics of a song don't need to *mean* something. They can be illustrative. They can be unconscious manifestations of a feeling, taking form in words. Genius commentators seem to ignore that, as they dig into a song like they are searching for a hidden treasure, a hidden meaning buried deep down in the obscure lyricism. Genius' commentators often bring weird comparisons:  > Artist 1 said X, Y and Z. This is clearly a reference to Artist 2, who in 1966 said X, Y and Z. Not everything needs to be a reference, not everything needs to have a hidden meaning. And please: not everything is a political/social criticism. I think that Genius is a wonderful platform, unlike any other in music. But the way it's used kind of ruins it. What do y'all think?","While I agree overall, I‚Äôve found Genius to be a big step up from Songmeanings.net.

Rubber Soul is probably the greatest record ever. Maybe the Phil Spector Christmas record is right up there with it, and it‚Äôs hard to say that the Who‚Äôs Tommy isn‚Äôt one of the best, too. But Rubber Soul came out in December of 1965 and sent me right to the piano bench. It‚Äôs a whole album of Beatles folk songs, a whole album where everything flows together and everything works. I remember being blown away by ‚ÄúYou Won‚Äôt See Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Looking Through You‚Äù and ‚ÄúGirl.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt just the lyrics and the melodies but the production and their harmonies. They had such unique harmonies, you know? In ‚ÄúYou Won‚Äôt See Me,‚Äù Paul sings low and George and John sing high. There‚Äôs an organ drone in there, a note that‚Äôs held down for the last third of the song or so. Those were touches they were trying, almost art music. What was so great about the Beatles was you could hear their ideas so clearly in their music. They didn‚Äôt pose like some other bands, and they didn‚Äôt try to stuff too much meaning in their songs. They might be singing a song about loneliness or a song about anger or a song about feeling down. They were great poets about simple things, but that also made it easier to hear the song. And they never did anything clumsy. It was like perfect pitch but for entire songs. Everything landed on its feet.*",119

i2wxlk,"So, just got done listening to this in order cover to cover. And I‚Äôm blown away. Coming from her duet with Calvin Harris on ‚ÄúOne Kiss‚Äù I didn‚Äôt really expect the album to sound the way it did. Just as the name says, it sounds like futuristic nostalgia. The synths and strings used throughout the album really sell me on this vintage 80‚Äôs vibe that I absolutely love. The bass and overall production on the record is booming with vibrancy and is such a treat to listen to. The best way I can describe it is sound based neon.  While some of the content of the music seemed a bit airy and light, I feel that adds to the record. It‚Äôs taking the listener back to something simple, yet complicated. Eliciting feelings tied to love and hardship. The opening track ‚ÄòFuture Nostalgia‚Äô is a great opener and then leads right into ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äô. Those 2 tracks back to back are great and really set a precedent for the rest of the album to follow.  I will say, while most of the album is great, the last 2 tracks are a bit of a decline from the rest. ‚ÄòGood in Bed‚Äô and ‚ÄòBoys Will be Boys‚Äô to me, don‚Äôt fit the rest of the album. I don‚Äôt get the same feeling I do while listening to the rest of the record. Both songs are great, but they don‚Äôt match the same feeling I have for tracks like ‚ÄòPhysical‚Äô or ‚ÄòHallucinate‚Äô, both of which I think are high points of the album.  I‚Äôm curious to know what others think because I don‚Äôt know many people who have either a) listened to the album or b) listen to albums in general. Overall, solid album and definitely gonna keep me coming back for more of her music in the future.","Rina Sawyama's SAWAYAMA has my #1 spot right now. Every track just has so much individual purpose, the production is absolute fire, the track flow is perfect. Not a bad song on the album. It's got spots that both push the boundaries of pop while mastering its essential components with respect and tradition.",63
i36nh5,"Sometimes, an album holds a lot of promise. However, it can happen that an album has some really good tracks that the rest of the tracklist doesn't measure up to. This can be either due to songwriting or production quality, but it can also be due to some tracks being very similar in vibe and their flow together is blocked by the rest of the tracklist that may differ in style, sound and vibe. In these cases, I believe that the album in question would be much better off as an EP comprised of the good tracks or just the tracks that sound like they belong together and stand out for one reason or another. Here are some albums I would convert into EPs if I could: **The Rolling Stones - Sticky Fingers**: Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I feel as though the cool-ass title and cover art would have been justified had the tracklist been like this: *Brown Sugar - Can't You Hear Me Knocking - Bitch - Wild Horses*. The first three tracks are slick and dirty Stones rockers that just go with the overall aesthetic of the record, and Wild Horses could have been a really nice closing track. What the album is instead is very slow and druggy, which I can understand due to their lifestyles at the time of recording, but for me, it is sadly one of those listens that isn't as fulfilling in its album state. **The xx - I See You**: I'm sad this album didn't live up to the potential of some of the dancier tracks on it, especially as Jamie xx got to shine on this album. I really like the band's debut, but On Hold, which to me is one of the best singles of the 2010s, had me excited for their embrace of the rich UK electronic music scene. Instead, the album was a mixed bag that tired to move forward but also stay in the past. If it were an EP, I wish it would have gone like this: *Dangerous - I Dare You - On Hold - Performance*. Like on Sticky Fingers, the final track would be the softest moment and on this album, it is a very powerful track and on an EP it would be a fantastic closer. **Justin Timberlake - Justified:** You have the Neptunes, Timbaland and a very talented pop star working together on an album and most of it ends up being a forgettable snoozefest. There are absolute gems in here, and most of them are already hit singles (obviously). It really doesn't ""justify"" the 1 hour run time and for that reason I'd trim it into an EP that would go like this: *Like I Love You - Rock Your Body - Senorita - (Oh No) What You Got - (And She Said) Take Me Now - Cry Me a River.* The 1-2-3 punch of the Neptunes-produced hit singles would have run very smoothly and then the three Timbaland tracks would have chance to shine with Cry Me a River ending the EP on a high note. **Janelle Monae - Dirty Computer**: I know it's an acclaimed record, but I just never felt as crazy about it as I did about The ArchAndroid. It does have some fantastic tracks and I would have had it be an EP like this: *Dirty Computer - Pynk - Django Jane - Make Me Feel - I Like That - Americans.* This configuration would eliminate a lot of the slow-burners that bore me and the unconvincing party tracks at the start. What albums do you think would have worked better as EPs?","This thread has been tagged as a list thread.

i3lmzp,"I think albums can be *special*, more than a collection of songs, more than the sum of its parts. Plenty of artists just throw a bunch of loosely related songs together in whatever order feels right to push a release, but that's not what I'm talking about - I'm talking about albums that really exploit the format and bring you into their world for ~45 minutes. It's like the difference between watching a half hour episode of a syndicated comedy vs watching a 2.5 hr slow burning movie.  So what makes an album stand out *to you*? What are some albums that go above and beyond and really use the medium to its fullest? This could include concept albums/""rock operas"" but it doesn't necessarily need to be that strict.  One album that has made me think about the whole format is [Igor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRDspAlvy_N-TyGPLFi5VoF4QiXrA1OVz) by Tyler, the Creator. The album begins with nearly 30 seconds of harsh, distorted synth bass. Igor's Theme certainly sets up the darker, gritty vibe of what's to come in the album and also sets up the distorted synth bass as its own ""character"" - this nasty bass comes back throughout the album, in nearly every song in some shape or fashion. The album's second song Earthquake gets a little more specific but still is kind of setting the stage, talking about the themes of love, anxieties over losing their loved one, self consciousness. And by track 3, the ""narrative"" really kicks off and you're in for a wild ride. I won't explain every little thing, but I think it's genius, using the first 2 tracks, the first 5-6 minutes to just open the door and bring listeners into the world of Igor.  It's also worth mentioning the halfway point of the album, where the A/B split is (on vinyl anyway). A side ends with ""New Magic Wand"", a claustrophobic, anxiety inducing track where the protagonist is starting to spiral out of control, even becoming violent over their love interest. And the B side begins with a slight change of heart, or maybe perspective - ""A Boy is a Gun"" shows the protagonist realizing how this relationship is turning them into something they don't want to be, the ""violence"" in the relationship (with gun imagery). Turning the record over starts a change in the narrative, leading us through the ""epiphanies"" and growth of the protagonist as the album closes out.  Now vinyl is having a moment again but it's still a lil niche, and the whole A/B side thing isn't usually considered (especially since streaming services don't differentiate sides and many artists that don't press vinyl probably don't even think about where an A/B split would even occur). But, I think this is another cool way the album ""format"" can be exploited - use the tiny break between sides of a record for a change of pace, or for a narrative purpose. Even in a non vinyl context I'm sure there are plenty of albums that have a distinct halfway point or climax like this. This post is starting to get way too long, and I want to hear what y'all think. What are some strengths of the album format? What are some artists that have used the album to enhance the musical experience? Is the traditional album dying, or do you think the rise in singles/EPs/loosies means that the albums that *do* come out will be more conceptual, or more well thought out?  *** Honorable mentions:  [Skiptracing](https://youtu.be/SiDtKOwe7lw) by Mild High Club - a trippy, psychedelic journey following a protagonist who is like a detective, tracing his way back through the American musical tapestry, touching on jazz, blues, psychedelia, and noise. Includes a freakout noise track in the middle followed by one of the most chill, soothing songs I've ever heard. Like musical whiplash in the best way.  [Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQcg8VywA0W1RkIupbcWPV8h8GVXBoZYl) by Arctic Monkeys - somewhere between a concept album and a drunken lounge singer's daydream. The concept is a little loose and there's not a real story thread to follow, but the combination of the crooning vocal style, the futuristic vibe and imagery, and the pacing of the record really create a unique little ""world"" I can step into whenever I put this one on. [Nonagon Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRvZ7cdgjmKTex0H8W39MkjefEyTYg35A) by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - ok maybe I'm taking the piss here but there's something to be said for these boys and the way they conceptualize/execute an album. This is like a subversion of the album format, where every song is connected, songs fade in and out of each other, melodies from previous songs show up in later songs, and at the end of it all it loops you back to track 1, kicking the whole thing off once more. If nothing else, it's an interesting way to look at how an artist can ""play"" with the format a bit","The concept Album has been around forever. Tommy from The Who The Wall from Pink Floyd These two have pretty straightforward narratives, almost like a play. Then you have some that are more ""conceptual"", in that its not necessarily a narrative you follow, but a mood. Albums like this include  NIN- The Downward Spiral. Not necessarily a narrative but you are definitely following a ""narrator"" down into a deep well of rage, depression, anxiety, bliss, and nihilism. Neutral Milk Hotel- In The Aeroplane Over The Sea. Famously inspired by The Diary Of Anne Frank. Often misrepresented as being ""about Anne Frank"". I wont write anymore about this bc its been beat to death. But it is a beautifully sad album, and you can read countless theories about it ""concept"" online.  Cheers",87

Beck, Radiohead and Arctic Monkeys all come to mind as having their very first single release still being their most popular song; are there many other examples of this?

The three songs I'm meaning (Loser, Creep, I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor), are not popularly agreed to be each artist's best, but they've always stuck around through whatever else that artist ended up doing and each remain probably the best selling or most popular.

How has it been 19 years and there hasn't been one rock song to reach #1? I could've swore Green Day ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" hit #1 but no.",Honestly Im really kinda sick of this discussion. Rock is no longer the dominant commercial music medium. It hasnt been for a long time and it never will be again. Not that there isnt great rock music still around.

Even so, I notice many people saying Tupac is still alive somewhere and pointing fingers at Akil the MC or Kasinova tha Don. What about Biggie?","Ignoring all of the strange circumstances surrounding his death, as others have mentioned, I think people took the Makaveli stuff way too seriously. Machiavelli was a Renaissance philosopher who wrote a book called The Prince - in the book, he claims that you can get one over on your enemies by faking your own death. Apparently, Tupac read this book whilst in prison. Some people think Makaveli is an anagram for AM ALIVE K, with the K being a clue towards Kasinova the Don, who made music with Tupac's posse, The Outlawz.  On the Makaveli album, people thought you could hear Tupac say ""Suge shot me"" right at the very start of Bomb First. It's very quiet, but it's there (he obviously doesn't say ""Suge shot me"" though). Then came the seemingly-endless posthumous work, like the album Better Dayz, where on the outro, he repeats ""Expect me like you expect Jesus to come back, I'm coming!"" Eminem also edited his voice on the awful Loyal to the Game album, so you had Tupac shouting out G-Unit, 50 Cent and Eminem himself.

i5rr3m,"I mean for god sake she‚Äôs a fucking poet. She‚Äôs got so many peaks in her career, but her sophomore album Clouds can easily go toe to toe with any of Van Morrison‚Äôs bullshit, the best of Dylan, Simon, or Nick Drake. Speaking of, look online, people are always looking for artists similar to Nick Drake. And other commenters will list off a bunch of bum ass motherfuckers who‚Äôs only commonality with Nick Drake is the fact they‚Äôre  white guys that play guitar.  And not one person will bring up an artist playing *around the same time* who shares the same love of gorgeous chords, vocal melody, and naturalistic poetry.....I wonder why *‚ÄùWoke up to a Chelsea Morning‚Äù* Has got to be one of the greatest openings to a song ever.   The line,  *‚ÄúAnd the sun poured in like butterscotch‚Äù* Is so perfectly crafted you can‚Äôt escape the picture it paints in your mind. It‚Äôs a heatseeking missile.  Thank you for coming to my TED talk.","This is yet another 'X is underrated' post, where X is not even underrated, where your only point is to ask others to validate your random feelings. Yeah, she's good. She's always been celebrated as one of the greatest songwriters of the 70's, and you can bet Dylan (who invited her on the Rolling Thunder Revue with him), Simon and the brilliant Van Morrison would all testify to her capabilities. From wikipedia: > She has received many accolades, including nine Grammy Awards and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Rolling Stone called her ""one of the greatest songwriters ever"", and AllMusic has stated, ""When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century"". She also received a lifetime achievement award at the Grammy's. Dylan received only one more Grammy than she has for at least twice as many albums. Does this sound like an 'underrated' artist to you or that she's been a victim of sexism? Certainly it's more difficult for a woman in the music industry, but what are you basing it on? Or are you referring only to a some threads on a young-male-dominated internet forum?",274
i6i93j,"Over the past month or so, Spiderland has been on a consistent rotation as far as my music listening goes and I've listened to it through multiple times recently. I've known about the album for a couple years but I never really LOVED it until a little while ago. I'm really desperate to have a conversation about it with someone, as I really do believe it's a perfect album about human suffering and the like. Anyone wanna discuss?","From that album, my favorite song is ""Good Morning, Captain"". I really like the repetitive (in some parts) guitar and bass that ""doesn't"" seem to match but do so in an eery way - for me at least. When finally he sings about the encounter with the child on the ship, and the whispers turn into screams... wow.  That was just fantastic. I felt goosebumps while listening to this song. I also like the song about that date at the Carnival. Something about the way the story is told brings me chills. Maybe the whispers contribute to that...?",91
i7wyj8,"I think there's so different criteria about this and I wanted to ask all of you your thoughts about this subject. In my case, I have one concert that had the 99% of the things I hate when I go to concerts. And that's when I saw Foo Fighters live in 2018.  I always thought that I would like to see Dave Grohl live being like he is. He talks a lot with the crowd and is kind of a clown. But seeing him talk over 30 minutes was painfully boring. Also, they made three covers, including a awful mashup between John Lennon's Imagine and Van Halen's Jump; and lenghtened the songs a lot with either very long drum solos or obvious and boring guitar solos. The concert went along for almost 3 hours and the last one felt almost like a torture, when I was BEGGING that he would play Everlong right after Best Of You. But no, they had to do an encore, play three songs and then play Everlong. They did 23 songs in 3 hours that night, 3 of them being covers. I mean, unless you're Godspeed You! Black Emperor, if you played 23 songs in three hours it means that it was filled with a lot of garbage. Also I only saw two bands who managed to give a great concert playing more than two hours: Radiohead and Metallica. The thing is that a lot of people LOVED that concert. I'm from Argentina and we are known for being the best crowd in the world or at least the best crowd Foo Fighters had. And it seems like a lot of people saw a entirely different concert than I did. On the other hand, Queens of the Stone Age opened for them that night and that was an amazing concert. 75 minutes long, 16 songs played. Not much interaction with the crowd but the performances were on point. And most importantly: they made me want more. I never walked out of a concert before it ended but Foo Fighters was the band that almost made me do it. What are your thoughts about this? I know I'm being a little too harsh with FF, but like I said it had all the things I don't like in a concert.","The most disappointing thing about a concert for me is if it sounds exactly like their albums. If I only wanted to hear their album I wouldn't have gone through the trouble of buying tickets and cramming into a crowded venue. Give me some improvisation! Give me extended takes! Interact with the room! I want a little spontaneity, not rehearsed studio perfection",191

I just feel like there are too many people who don't listen to him because he makes pop music, or they're taylor swift fans(lets not mention those for a minute). To some others, he can come off as arrogant, which is certainly understandable, and probably true, but focusing purely on his music, it's very good. Firstly, there's his guitar, and even people who hate him will agree, he's a damn good guitarist. His lyrics are simple but meaningful, his voice is soothing and he's always able to integrate his guitar and voice well. He obviously does have some flaws, for example his non-guitar songs can sometimes sound bland(like 'waiting on the world to change'), but overall he is very good. This post wasn't about people who listened to him and didn't like it(that's perfectly fine, since music is subjective), more about the people who never give him a chance.",I really disagree.

This was super foolish in retrospect. The other day, something clicked for me and I decided to try out MCR‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Black Parade‚Äù.

idgdpf,"These genres seem to be wrongly used as synonyms but the difference always seemed to be where the genre got its roots from.

idutev,"Being boring and being annoying, are the two most common phrases people use to say that they don't like a specific type of music, song or musician. These two statements got me thinking on which is worse for the listener. If I had my own stance, I feel like being annoying is far worse as at least with a boring song which might not be offering a lot for me, it's not making rip your hair out and throw your headphones off your head. However, a lot of people I know are more critical of a song that is boring and I feel like those kinds of people don't like subdued music or they don't care about emotional depth.","This is a really interesting question. The most common response I hear is that it's better to be annoying than boring because then you've connected to your audience on an emotional level. But this kind of a response assumes a couple of things. Probably most glaringly it assumes that being boring or annoying are undiserable traits. But what's the context? For a soundtrack composer, there might come a time when they need to write something for a game, movie or whatever that purposefully sounds either boring or annoying. In that case, composing those things is not a question of being bad; it's succeeding! What if the context is that the music is supposed to be pleasant? Two composers create their own piece for this aim and one is viewed as ""boring"" and the other ""annoying"". In this case, I would argue that neither succeeded in their goal of being pleasant, but the one perceived as boring is closer to being pleasant than the one perceived as annoying. If the context is to become famous as a musician in pop music, it's probably better to be annoying than boring. At least that makes a splash of some kind. Of course, we could also just talk about our own experiences and just state which one we personally prefer. In my case, I actually prefer boring music slightly over annoying music.",224
ie7u0v,"The best examples I can give about what I am trying to get at come from the 90's. Genres like grunge, post-rock, shoegaze and ska punk emerged out of different musical ""movements"" so to speak. Someone recently posted an article about Hyperpop and trans artists, which made me wonder about the current ongoing musical waves/scenes/movements/subgenres that are currently taking place. So what are some of the current musical scenes that exist in 2020? Which ones are only starting and which ones are dying out? When is the 4th ska wave coming?","This new wave of Post-Punk artists.

ies8vt,"This is based on something I saw in a top 100 subreddit (won't tell you guys which) where someone insisted that February 3, 1959 was ""the day music died"" in that all the artists that came after cannot match the great classical composers, jazz and blues legends, and first-wave rock and rollers. Similarly on this sub, the ""1111 Essential Recordings"" list favors the first great album within a genre rather than what the curator believes to be the best album. This line of thinking has some pitfalls, or at least unspoken assumptions: a) It strongly favors innovation over competence within a field, when historically some of the finest and most-loved music hasn't broken much new ground (AC/DC and Bach both mainly worked within the conventions of hard rock and late-Baroque classical music, yet many of their works are among the most beloved by aficionados of their genre). I understand that the ""first great album"" approach is kind of grading on a curve to make up for earlier artists having less raw material to work with (assuming it isn't just hipsters rediscovering 1950s oldies and going a bit too far with their love for them), but it seems to me to possibly go a bit too far. b) Genre boundaries are kind of arbitrary, and picking the first great work of a genre can depend wildly on how the genre is defined, and how different sub-genres and micro-genres are demarcated. Do we say that Aphex Twin must compete against Kraftwerk because they're both electronic music, or that the Beatles or Pink Floyd must face off against Chuck Berry because they're both rock? Does Paul Anka beat Ariana Grande because they're both pop? c) The biggest explosion of creativity or output in a genre isn't necessarily right at the beginning. Classical music took *centuries* to reach its stride, and hip-hop took decades to dominate the charts (from the late 1970s to the 2010s). Yes, some genres are very front-loaded (I've seen Johnny B. Goode, from rock and roll's first decade, as a candidate for the greatest song ever), but others grow slowly in popularity. d) Music doesn't just come from nowhere in most cases. There are some exceptions in which there is a social or technological prerequisite (the existence of a freethinking teenage population with disposable income was necessary for rock and roll, at least the more aggressive side, to succeed, and anything dependent upon the studio/distorted guitar/synths couldn't exist as a genre before those inventions were popularized), but continuous evolution is quite common and the idea of the heroic innovator is not often founded unless they are say an inventor or engineer.","It is all going to really depend on how you judge what is better. It seems like you are taking the view here that what sounds better is better, which is a fine stance to take, but it is not the only one.     There is some value in being the first to do something. Someone painting a white square on a white canvas today would be uninteresting, but 100 or so years ago, it was a new idea.  You are of course correct that it doesn't make it better just because it is older. But there is still value in innovating.",108
iff237,"It‚Äôs perfect. I mean perfectly made in every single way. I‚Äôm trying to hold off on overlistening to it. The song itself has a distinctly winter vibe to it which is accentuated in several places by the lyrics. So I want to enjoy the whole album at a time when I feel it will give me the most fulfilling listen possible. Which is fall/winter. But the song itself is a towering achievement. One of Joni‚Äôs best, and that‚Äôs saying something, and one of the most unique moldings of genres that‚Äôs existed before or since. Joni‚Äôs guitars are simply incredible. No. That‚Äôs not the right word, but I‚Äôm struggling to find words that fully encompass how gorgeous this song is.  Anyways.  They do something which is a hallmark of Joni guitar playing, The tunings sound like she got them from a music book written in the Middle Ages. They feel ancient. Like old oak trees, or mountains, rivers. Which I‚Äôm sure is intentional.  Then there‚Äôs Jaco Pastorius‚Äôs bass. Once again I‚Äôm at a loss for words here. The bass on this sounds like nothing I‚Äôve ever heard in any song, ever. A lot of people have pointed this out already but it sounds less like a bass playing the roll and notes a bass would normally play in more like a singer creating melodies to dance and balance out the ones coming from Joni‚Äôs voice and her guitar. But what him and Joni get out of those instruments is more than most artists get out of an entire pit orchestra in terms of scope, beauty, and sheer grandiosity. Not to mention Joni‚Äôs lyrics as well.  *‚ÄùAnd I know no one is gonna show me everything.* *We all come and go unknown.* *So deep and superficial,* *Between the forceps and the stone*‚Äù   I mean it‚Äôs lyrics like this which make me truly believe did the best of Joni can go toe to toe with the best of Dylan. And there are tons of lines like this. *In. This. Song. Alone.* *‚ÄúWhite flags of winters chimneys,* *Wave truce against the moon.* *In the mirrors of a modern bank.* *In the window of a hotel room*‚Äù Please, if you consider yourself a fan of music you owe it to yourself to at least check this song out.

It‚Äôs just different and totally her own. Me and my girlfriend listened to ‚ÄòNight Ride Home‚Äô all the way through for the first time yesterday. Such a solid album, from 1991. I actually like her 1998 album ‚ÄòTaming the Tiger‚Äô a lot too. It‚Äôs got a maturity to it, but still creative and new and again, just totally her.

ifoy7x,"Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.

They give off the vibe of a bunch of regular guys who are successful despite (seemingly) not trying very hard. I think it's hard to slate them. They are what they are: everyman bar band that made some hooky songs with relatable lyrics that ultimately had kind of brief run: all of their top 40 hits occurred in less than a ten year span.

ig9asz,"For those who don't know them, 100 Gecs is a bizarre music duo who is getting some recognition recently due to their weird music style which has been described as glitch pop, noise pop or glitchcore. Labels aside, it's an extremely abrasive yet really catchy sound that sounds basically like extremely distorted and glitchy pop with dubstep drops and occasionally some guitar riffs. The songs are fairly short and don't follow the conventional pop song structure. The other day I listened to their first album (the second one, which came out in July 2020, is composed by remixes) and I must say, the production is really detailed and thought-out. It's hard to say that this is unironically good music, but if you don't take it seriously it's really good stuff. The problem that I have is that a couple of tracks on the album (especially ""gec gec gec"") are too ear-raping and annoying, but others are extremely catchy. My favorite is ""xXXIwudnvrstopUXXx"", but ""stupid horse"" is a banger as well. Oh and yeah, the names are meme material as hell.  If you know 100 Gecs, what do you think of their music?","My theory is that if you are super into PC Music or had a nightcore and/or emo phase as a young kid/teen then you‚Äôll love gecs. I had that emo phase as a kid and loved nightcore so I naturally grew to like them. Their music reminds me of old YouTube. Late 2000s and early 2010s musical tropes turned up to 11 (as well as feeling like that era of the Internet). There is not a hint of irony as they genuinely love the style of music they‚Äôre making. It‚Äôs not for everyone as they are either a love it or hate it type of group.   I see them carrying the torch for weird internet type music. TikTok has been helping 100 gecs get noticed by a wider array of people. Artists like Yungster Jack and David Shawty were popularized on TikTok too who both operate in a similar lane to Gecs. They encapsulate this glitchy aesthetic which has been making waves in the SoundCloud underground. Hopefully this is a positive sign for the future of this brand of pop music. Sidenote: Because of Yungster Jack and David Shawty's rise in popularity from their viral hit Pressure, they were mentioned in an article published by Complex. There has been a new trend in pop/trap music that has been garnering a cult following which shares similarities to that of the glitch pop/glitchcore from these artists. That being the rise of surge/HexD/Bit-crushed where they take inspiration from lo-fi music/nightcore/pop/trap to make this intentionally ""crushed"" music that sounds like it was poorly recorded ringtone from an old flip phone.

ih2fuk,"If you've read this sub long enough, you've seen me bellyache about how XYZ obscure Japanese album is not available digitally in America. Part of the issue is distrust of low streaming revenue and a healthy market for CDs in Japan. Over the past few months, that has been changing dramatically. There are suddenly a bunch of key albums you can listen to right now. If you are a fan of city pop, you might be surprised that virtually the entire discographies of Anri and Yasuko Agawa are now available. It took me years to find Agawa's *Gravy*, it could take you seconds. Although they are not on Spotify, you can find most of Jiro Inagaki's jazz funk discography on Apple Music and TIDAL (including the debonair *Funky Stuff*). If you haven't heard them, you have no idea how great Logic System's first three albums are. They are as prescient as any proto-techno album of the early 80s and you can listen to them all. An additional tip: you can find a few artists only by using their name in Japanese script. *Scenery* by Ryo Fukui is a perennial RYM fave and it is actually on Spotify but only if you search for Fukui's name in Japanese: Á¶èÂ±ÖËâØ. The same is true for Makoto Kubota & The Sunset Gang, a Haruomi Hosino produced act from his pre-YMO period. They have five albums on Spotify including three remastered this year, but you have to use their name in Japanese to find them.","One of the best ways I've found to look for city pop on Spotify is to look at RYM charts for the genre and clicking through to albums that are listed as available on Spotify. A small quirk is that some of the links lead to an album on Spotify that has all tracks greyed out. Guess it depends on the region you're in. On a separate note, I've always been surprised at what broad kinds of music get lumped together under the city pop name. I've found music going from full-on 80s production, to more folky and even straight up jazz in the case of Scenery. Edit: it occurs to me that OP might have mentioned Scenery as an example of Japanese music, not city pop.",60
ihmmdx,"When prog was first becoming a thing in the 70‚Äôs I feel like bands made really interesting fusion/prog that I actually enjoy listening to.

From ages 16 and half of 17, I liked any of the music  that a guy I liked (that I didn‚Äôt even know irl but I thought he was cool from instagram) was into, which was mostly garage rock (ty segall, twin peaks, jay reatard) and indie rock and by bands that no one has heard of.

I had taken piano lessons and then abandoned them cause I didn't really like what I was playing. I also had a little Hip-Hop influence from my brother since he was a big fan of Logic when he was still underground (around 2012?).  I remember developing a thing for Electronic Music with Daft Punk after watching Tron Legacy, and from there it's kind of all a blur. Somehow this music got me back into playing Piano, and I remember learning Outside by Calvin Harris on Piano. I recall getting into Deadmau5 maybe a year later, and generally being into French House and Progressive House, dabbling in Brostep and Drum and Bass as well.  When I started High School I rediscovered Pink Floyd (my Mum is a big fan of their music) through a remix of Another Brick In The Wall by Eric Prydz. I got super into Pink Floyd after that, and I loved Progressive Rock. I also tried to learn almost literally every Pink Floyd song on Piano. Eventually I discovered The Dear Hunter (one of my favourites to this day) through the Pink Floyd subreddit and I started to love Post-Hardcore, Emo sounding prog rock like Circa Survive and Coheed and Cambria. My love for The Dear Hunter opened doors to acts like Manchester Orchestra (and eventually Phoebe Bridgers through a cover of MO's The Gold). Basically for the rest of high school I dabbled in other Indie Rock and Indie Pop. In first year Uni I got into Anthony Fantano and music reviewing and I expanded my tastes to encompass my previous stuff (but mostly based around Pink Floyd, Daft Punk and Logic) and I discovered some of my favourite artists. My favourite artists today are King Gizzard, Kendrick Lamar, My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, MGMT, Kanye West, and still Pink Floyd.

I'm not exaggerating it! My whole taste of music came from the music of radio stations in GTA (well, my mother and the radio stations I listen to also have a major role in the music I know and love today). I highly suggest listening to stations in GTA IV like Fusion FM, The Vibe, The Journey, LRR and JNR- there is a lot of good and underrated artists that you wouldn't usually discover on the web. I'd also love to recommend a few stations from Vice City Stories like Emotion, Wave 103, VCFL and Flash FM.

ijxair,"So everyone knows how big The Beatles are and as a huge fan of theirs I always wonder if their popularity was sustained throughout their entire run as a band. Through the early to mid 60s they were probably the biggest group in the world but I‚Äôm wondering if their popularity started to falter around 1968-1970. Obviously they were still releasing killer albums and singles but there were also new artists emerging too such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix. During their run from 1963-1970, were they never not on top?","Johns 'bigger than jesus' statement before their 66 world tour caused problems for them. Apart from burning their albums etc people were boycotting their shows. They talk about it in [this interview](https://youtu.be/8-ydua3F1Ik).  There's also an [interview from 1966](https://youtu.be/bipWrmvoJTg?t=517) where they're asked if they are worried that their popularity is fading, because they haven't sold out some of the venues on their tour. They say that they're still selling more tickets than any other band so they're not worried.",187
ikcied,"I mean the album just has this hard edge to it, this razor sharp quality that‚Äôs reflected in the guitars themselves. 60 years later and Davies guitar tone has still got the right mix of grit, clarity, and bite.  These guys sound way harder then anything the stones were doing at the same time and yet because of what the Kinks sound became known for it gets often gets overlooked with exception of All Day and You Really Got Me.  It‚Äôs amazing how tight this band is. Like, if they came out today they‚Äôd still sound fresh and unique. Their harmonies are **so** tight, the drums and the guitars complement eachother perfectly in terms of aggression, and their songwriting still sounds timeless.  Where else can you get harmonies that would make the N‚ÄôSync weep mixed with the garage blues sound bands like The Black Keys and White Stripes would be mining 40 years later ?",Totally agree! Their material from their debut into a good portion of the 70‚Äôs ranks up there with Beatles/Who/Stones/etc.,108
ikpgfh,"(see below link to the album I'm referring to)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCTOxiZ-lBU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCTOxiZ-lBU)  &#x200B; While I was never much a fan of The Offspring back in the day, I did like some of their songs.  Since I'm on a bit of a punk rock kick lately, I figured I'd go check out their best rated album (the only other album I had previously listened to in full was ""Americana,"" which was not very good from what i remember) So I've got my coffee and ready to chill and listen to this album.  The album begins with a monologue from some guy, who I assume is meant to portray one of those old timey DJs for a station that plays easy listening music.  The monologue goes: &#x200B; >Ahhhhh, it's time to relax, and you know what that means, a glass of wine, your favourite easy chair, and of course this compact disc playing and your home stereo.   >So go on, indulge yourself,  that's right, kick off your shoes, put your feet up,  lean back and just enjoy the melodies.  After all, music soothes even the savage beasts.  &#x200B; Of course this is dripping with irony because the next thing that comes up is some loud, fast-paced punk rock riffs.  Or at least is was meant to be ironic at the time when this album was released in 1994, since the main audience would've been teenagers who are into rowdy punk rock and not a 40 year olds looking to unwind with a glass of wine after a day at the office.   &#x200B; But then I got to thinking, well 26 years later, that IS what the audience is now.  I'm 30, so I'm still kind of a ""young adult,"" and probably younger than the average Offspring fan, but it got me thinking that this music which was once about pissing off your parents is now what the parents would want to listen to after putting the kids to bed and zoning out with some wine or beer in their favorite recliner.  I'm doing pretty much what the guys saying on that monologue, unironically  &#x200B; Obviously this isn't a crazy revelation - we all get old and the rebellious music of the past becomes the music of the middle aged office drones.  But still thought this was interesting enough to share","One of the first albums I ever bought, probably around 11 y/o at the time.

in4yc1,"Have A Nice Life are a post-punk/shoegaze/blackgaze (?) band made up of Dan Barrett and Tim Macuga. Their most acclaimed album is their lengthy, lofi 2008 album, Deathconsciousness. The song Holy Fucking Shit: 40,000 is one of the best on the album, and is an all-time personal favourite song of mine. The title is most likely a reference to Warhammer 40k, a video game set in a bleak dystopian future in which humanity is on the brink of collapse at the hands of supernatural creatures and robots. I don't know enough about instruments and music in general to talk about the instrumentation, but what I will say is it's lo-fi, has a beeping synthesizer sample, acoustic guitar, and in the second half of the song, heavy drums and crushing bass. If any of that is incorrect, let me know. As amazing as the instrumentation is, I'm more interested in the lyrical side of things.  >""Everything you do is planned out in advance, And the stars push their dark wills down on you."" This line (and song) holds the viewpoint of determinism, the idea that humans have no free will, and all the choices they make are already made for them as a consequence of everything that has already happened. It reminds me of predestination in Calvinism; Calvin believed that God had already decided whether each human would go to heaven or hell before they were even born. Humans have no freedom to choose, as every choice is influenced by past experiences and the environment. You didn't choose to read this, everything in your life leading up to this moment made you read this. Later in the verse, Dan says,  >You're reacting just the way I thought you would. which furthers this viewpoint of determinism. > And wolves all tear themselves apart better in packs, That's just a function we will have to work on through  Dan describes a gruesome, violent image of animals tearing each other apart, but says it's simply a calculated, predictable occurrence such as math, that we just have to get through. This line shows early signs of apathy and lack of empathy for others. Now on to the chorus. >And I've replaced my heart with metal parts   >   >And I'm working out just fine, but I can't get it to start   >   >We're machines that breathe and weep and look really good trained to kill He's replaced his living heart with metal, as if he is a machine. He can physically function, but he can't use his heart for emotion or love like a living one could. This possibly refers to apathy and anhedonia. Anhedonia is described as the inability to feel pleasure in normally pleasurable activities. This message is strongly conveyed again in the album's penultimate track, I Don't Love. He bluntly states that he cannot love anyone or anything, as if he has no heart at all.  His repetitive reference to being an emotionless killing machine is seen again in the next verse, where he takes the role of the Terminator. >Send me back in time and I'll bring us back in line   >   >Just tell me whose mother I have to kill For anyone who has seen Terminator, this is an obvious reference. This reiterates the message that he is an unfeeling, inhumane machine who knows nothing but destruction. This theme possibly relates to a nihilistic-related viewpoint that humanity's purpose is to destroy everything. In the album's final track Earthmover, Dan describes Golems, mythical creatures who can and do destroy everything, except for themselves. They topple mountains and destroy anything in sight as they walk the earth. But they are immortal. All they know is destruction. Not love, emotion, feelings. Just destruction. They chant ""We wish we were dead."" I believe this is related to the machine/ Terminator character in this track. >I'm fine like I've always been, and I don't remember when   >   >My conscience wasn't acting up again He doesn't know when he lost his empathy, his emotions, his ability to love. Coming back to determinism, this is because he doesn't choose to act in the way he does. He doesn't choose to lack a conscience, and since he doesn't choose or remember when this came about, he doesn't know what terrible things he has done in the past. After this verse, the chorus repeats, and the back half of the song is just instrumentation. I think this song's lyrics use the machine metaphor perfectly to describe apathy, depression, lack of empathy, numbness, and the viewpoint of determinism. If you have any further input or any corrections for me, feel free to let me know!

ineoup,[For those who haven't heard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-fjyEIgWik) The part starts at 6:43. I get the feeling of old time European folk which was likely intended considering the album has something to do with Ann Frank. There's deep and undeniable despair that kind of erupts with the horns as the end approaches. It is difficult to articulate how precisely that expression is conveyed. It makes me tear up sometimes. Looking to hear other's thoughts on it and if you happen to have some music suggestions.,"Yeah I always liked the end to this song. It's a bit morbid and I never thought hard into the lyrics but the ""skin begin to blend itself to mine"" always called to my mind the experience of death. Dissolving away as others dissolve next to you. The horns really captured that morbid anguish you can do nothing about.",78
inu5rt,"So I feel late to the party, but just WOW. I am working my way through the P-Funk catalog and I am just amazed by the variety of styles and virtuosic musicianship. From far out psychedelia to smooth RnB to gritty rock, paired with lyrics that are nonsensical, comedic, deep, emotive, and political. Then there is the production which is so layered and deep and at times organized chaos. I'm amazed, growing up George Clinton was more of a character than a musician to me. I never gave his music any attention. Then I listened to Questlove Supreme's interviews with George and Bootsy and I vibes with them so much I was intrigued musically. I immediately recognized tons of samples from hip-hop. The first Funkadelic album sounds like the spiritual successor of Axis, Bold as Love. Maggot Brain is so incredible as an album, I'm amazed it came out so early in their chronology. Standing on the Verge of Getting It On. Up For the Down Stroke, America Eats It's Young, Mothership Connection, Tales of Kid Funkadelic and Clones of Dr. Funkenstein are instant favorites for me.  I'm amazed at the release dates on these albums too, some come out within a week of each other. Just wow.","Yeah, the run of George Clinton albums with those groups in the 70's is unparalleled. I might get slammed for this but I do think part of it has to do with a general disrespect for the artistry of Black music in America. I had always liked Mothership and Maggot Brain but it took me years to realize that almost all of the records from the early and mid-70's are on that level. The silliness and characterization on the albums gives me a laugh almost every time. But the humor on songs like Funkentelechy is *smart* - such a bizarre send-up of American consumerism. So many people have tried to turn me onto Vulfpack and Gambino's ""Awaken My Love!"" and hadn't been P-Funk fans. It's sad! They don't get the respect they deserve in my opinion, but it's hard to think of any American band that has a discography like them. Grateful Dead might be a parallel, as they're another group that's well-known but can be frequently overlooked or relegated to a mere subculture rather than a constant innovator.  Sounds like you're gonna get around to all of it, but can't recommend Funkentelechy vs. Placebo Syndrome and One Nation Under a Groove enough.",184
io81uv,"I don‚Äôt think any album can come close to either of these albums when it comes to musical arrangements and producers. I love both of these albums dearly but it pisses me off whenever people say the only good songs on Pet Sounds are the main 3 that have millions of views on YouTube. I feel like people only say that so Sgt Pepper doesn‚Äôt get any competition. IMO the only 3 star songs on Pet Sounds are: That‚Äôs not me, and Let‚Äôs go away for a while. While Sgt pepper has stuff like: Mr kite, Good morning, Good morning, Within you without you. To make myself clear, I do not think these songs are BAD, but these are not songs you think of when you think of these albums.   I also hate it whenever people say that it isn‚Äôt as good because Brian Wilson needed help to write the music, well I have a question for anyone who thinks like that, Have you ever heard of A thing Called: Lennon-Mcartney? Ever heard of George Martin? Ever listened to the orchestra on many of their songs? Wilson may not have had the lyrical genius, but it pisses me off to hear that argument.  I think the saddest thing about Pet Sounds is that it didn‚Äôt do as well because of Capitol not promoting it, Pet Sounds would have broke the charts IMO. But I do know this for a fact, it very well could have kept #10 including the promotions because before Pet Sounds, all they did is SurferRock, not make songs that describe depression and wanting things you can‚Äôt have, or struggles with your partner. Basically songs about life, which is one thing no album will ever do better.   To get to the main course, Wilson‚Äôs wall of sound, the unique changes, certain instruments playing in different frequencies or notes, it‚Äôs unique, it was mind blowing back then ( at least Mcartney though so ) every song onPet Sounds has its certain vibe that either cheers you up, makes you think, or makes you cry, almost every song on here has that middle section interlude that completely changes the game. Phew okay I‚Äôm done :)","I think this is actually generally accepted to be true and many people would argue that *Pet Sounds* is, in fact, *more* revolutionary than *Sgt. Pepper* because of how it was the first rock concept album and how it pioneered studio-as-instrument techniques.",181
iov42z,"So the term 'Oscar bait' is often used derisively to describe movies that are purpose built to rack up nominations; these are almost always character focused dramas often dealing with topics like racism and homosexuality, with big bonus points given for being a period movie or including old Hollywood in some way.

Like there‚Äôs so many layers to ‚Äúclassic rock.‚Äù You have the British Invasion stuff, psychadelic rock, hard rock, hard blues rock, progressive rock, yacht rock, hair metal, grunge, like it‚Äôs so diverse and it almost feels like an overlooking or under-appreciating the sub-genres.

There‚Äôs always tiny changes in production that go unnoticed but can make or break a song. Idk, let me know if you have other reasons why you hate it or why you like it","There‚Äôs a few reasons.

When he was young, he pioneered a Velvet Underground influenced proto-punk, with songs like Pablo Picasso and She Cracked. Then he turned to an almost Doo-Wop sound, traveling the country with only acoustic guitar and a drummer. You can like Roadrunner or When Harpo Played His Harp or you can like both.

isouzs,"If you look at what differentiates music from speech or other sounds (both from a theory perspective and across cultures), a few elements come up time and time again - pitch (melody and harmony), rhythm, and timbre/texture. Each of these elements translates to a different style of vocal music: The manipulation of **pitch** yields singing, specifically melody and harmony. This element of music was historically focused on in Western classical singing, at times to the expense of almost everything else (although to be fair, there wasn't notation for rhythm in the earliest music). Pure singing can be seen for instance at the singing of the American national anthem before events, where rhythm often goes to the wayside as individual notes have arbitrary lengths. The manipulation of **rhythm**, along with rhyming, yields rapping. This style of vocals has been a bit more controversial (Ray Charles reportedly simultaneously dismissed it as old hat and non-musical), but it naturally follows from another distinguishing characteristic of music and is as distinctly musical as singing, if not more so; the ""speech to song illusion"" shows that repeating a sound rhythmically can cause people to view it as musical. Rhythm began to upstage melody in modern classical music as well as in ragtime and later in R&B and its descendants. The manipulation of **timbre**, as applied to the human voice, yields shrieking, screaming, and death growls. These are possibly even more controversial than rapping, and unlike pitch or rhythm many non-musical sounds have highly recognizable timbre, but with the advent of drone music in the 1950s-1960s timbre-based composition has become accepted in the classical world at least.","No, it's not because my music theorist father, who was a music theorist and went to music school, says that music is harmony, melody, and rhythm.

As someone who is really into the idea of categorizing by genre, I've been having a hard time classifying some of his albums, mostly in his later career, rom *Mule Variations* on. ""Blues Rock"" doesn't quite capture everything, and the soundtrack albums are even more difficult. Cabaret? I've called them jazz, but they're not quite jazz. It's a weird fusion of jazz, blues, rock, traditional pop, showtunes, and classic Waits insanity. So, how do you all classify Tom Waits?","Tom Waits makes Americana.

Music shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúchore‚Äù or an ‚Äúexercise‚Äù to get through. It should make you happy, or glad to be alive when you hear it. It shouldn‚Äôt be some dusty, archaic tome you force yourself to enjoy for the sake of having expanded horizons.  Because at the end of the day you can‚Äôt trick yourself into enjoying music that you don‚Äôt.  For example, I made a post here on the last Arctic Monkeys album. Most critics loved it and quite a few fans do as well. I don‚Äôt. And I see no reason to waste time listening to something that doesn‚Äôt click with me.  The ‚Äúhigh‚Äù I get from hearing Astro Lounge by Smash Mouth, an album I love, is a world away from the distant and ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù high of listening to something like Lou Reed‚Äôs Metal Machine Music.  That‚Äôs my opinion tho.",265
iw1qbb,"In my mind, the whole point of having a cartoon band is that you‚Äôre able to use every element of them to tell a story/ convey a larger point ; E.g: Every part of Plastic Beach as a project was used to say something about climate change, or at least contribute to the world that was built around those ideas (from the music videos, to the album artwork, to the songs themselves). Sure, the songs are still good, but listening to/experiencing a Gorillaz project used to feel like a very immersive experience, whereas the post-2017 stuff just feels like the Damon Albarn variety hour (not that some of the newer stuff hasn‚Äôt been good, but it‚Äôs missing that special ingredient).","Idk, I always thought of Gorillaz as a musical project with the characters, worlds, lore, etc as fun extra side stuff, like the script and interactive media for ‚ÄúBecause the Internet‚Äù or the film for ‚ÄúLemonade‚Äù. Sure it‚Äôs not as grand as it used to be, but I still find it engaging, and I recognize that it‚Äôs literally just two guys and everything they do is pretty expensive and takes time. Music wise though I think they‚Äôre creating some of their best work yet, the Song Machine singles can go toe-to-toe with Demon Dayz and Plastic Beach",241
iwqq3y,"I noticed this when Tame Impala dropped The Slow Rush earlier this year. The Tame Impala subreddit had a few people pushing that stance early on. I don‚Äôt understand how lacking experimentation is a valid criticism or even a reason to not enjoy an album. Often times the lack of experimentation stems from an artist finding their own sound. They have their own way of making music, so they can fully express those ideas with their new music. That‚Äôs what happens to most artists, they eventually tap into their own shit. I can‚Äôt even think of a reason why that‚Äôs disappointing, but it‚Äôs a criticism I think needs to die out.",Some bands I think back themselves into a corner where people will be disappointed if they aren‚Äôt always evolving and experimenting. If Radiohead just put out another straight rock record I must admit that would be a let down.,156
ix1ou1,"This morning I was listening to ""To Know Him Is To Love Him"", the 1958 hit single by the Teddy Bears which was written by Phil Spector. He produced a series of hits throughout the 60s (too numerous to mention here, you already know them anyway) and, in 1967, produced what he saw as his opus: ""River Deep - Mountain High"" for Ike & Tina Turner. The single was a flop and disillusioned with the music industry Spector entered ""retirement"" at age 28, only electing to produce a few select projects over the next forty years. Talk about holding a grudge! So, are there other examples of artists that are at or close to the peak of their career and quit out of spite or a perceived slight? Little Richard famously dipped out at the peak of his career but it was due to religious reasons. Scott Walker left the Walker Brothers gravy train at their peak to seek a different musical path. Interesting stories but not in the same realm as Spector essentially taking his ball and going home because the public didn't like *one* song he thought was good.","This thread has been tagged as a list thread.

ixgtus,"Hi, guys. I think that the roots of shoegaze and dream pop are really interesting. I think that you can find multiple examples of ‚Äúproto-shoegaze/proto-dream pop‚Äù in music history, and it‚Äôs intriguing to see the development of shoegaze and dream pop. For example, there are the influences of My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive and Ride. Kevin Shields definitely took cues from Sonic Youth &amp;amp; Dinosaur Jr., and MBV listened to Husker Du, Sonic Youth &amp;amp; Dinosaur Jr.; according to Wikipedia, Isn‚Äôt Anything was influenced by American indie rock, most notably Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth. Kevin Shields really liked the Ramones &amp;amp; the Beatles, and he liked Wire; Kevin Shields talked about the Velvet Underground, too. Sonic Youth influenced Slowdive and Ride, and Mark Gardener got into the Cure, the Smiths and Cocteau Twins. Ride liked the Stone Roses, and the Byrds heavily influenced Ride.  Also, Slowdive liked the Jesus and Mary Chain and Dinosaur Jr., and Cocteau Twins influenced Slowdive. As for Cocteau Twins‚Äô inspirations, Liz Fraser clearly idolized Siouxsie and the Banshees, and she had connections to punk. Robin Guthrie talked about punk, and he was influenced by Phil Spector and the Birthday Party. Simon Raymonde admired Wire, and the Sex Pistols influenced Cocteau Twins.  The Velvet Underground‚Äôs ‚ÄúSunday Morning‚Äù predicted dream pop by more than a decade, and the Byrds played a role in the sounds of MBV, Slowdive and Ride. I think that Pet Sounds could‚Äôve foreshadowed dream pop, and the Beach Boys‚Äô ‚ÄúAll I Wanna Do‚Äù is a straight up dream pop song (I‚Äôm referencing a user that talked about that tune). Faust‚Äôs ‚ÄúKrautrock‚Äù set a template for MBV, too.  You could say that the Beatles‚Äô ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Only Sleeping‚Äù sounds like dream pop, and Spacemen 3 influenced Ride. The Velvet Underground‚Äôs experimentation, dissonance and fondness for noise paved the way for shoegaze, and the reverb/production on Joy Division‚Äôs Unknown Pleasures reminded me of shoegaze. Some of the Cure‚Äôs stuff has clear ties to dream pop, and even parts of Wire‚Äôs late 70s trilogy (especially on Chairs Missing and 154) sounded like shoegaze and dream pop. Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr. were pivotal for the creation of shoegaze, in general, and I think that Husker Du‚Äôs excessive distortion/super-noisy guitar parts on Zen Arcade and New Day Rising foreshadowed MBV. Of course, Cocteau Twins and the Jesus and Mary Chain are essential for the development of shoegaze.","You watch the newest Trash Theory video on YouTube ? Basically covers this, I‚Äôd be surprised if it wasn‚Äôt a main source for this. If not check it out it will be right up your alley.",87
ixnwps,"I always see people going crazy about how he gave mbdtf a 6 and about how he is shitting on artist's music, and even in my favorite artist's subreddits whenever somebody mention The Needle Drop in a bad way he gets downvoted to oblivion, do people don't understand that his opinion is as valid as theirs? &#x200B; i think he even says so if im not mistaken, that it's just his opinion, honestly i tried to listen to the album's he gave 10 to and some of them are really.. on the verge of being annoying. &#x200B; i watched many video's of him in the past until i tackled his daughters review where he gave the album a 10 so i gave it a listen and holy shit like, no disrespect towards anyone but that was the moment i understood that his opinion is as valid as mine","Why would you put his opinion higher than it should be in the first place? I've been subbed to him and have watched his reviews/bought some of his merch for almost 10 years now, and I can't understand the meme culture around his reviews.  I just like watching for the guy and his valid and sometimes invalid criticisms.  At the end of the day I couldn't give less of a shit about what arbitrary number he scores an album, and if it's one I've heard and think it's much better or worse than he says, I shrug and agree to disagree.  Through him and 4chan's /mu/ board way back in the day I discovered a lot of music I probably wouldn't have otherwise.

ixuzy9,"When it comes to the best rap album of the 90s, Illmatic and Enter The Wu-Tang generally comes up. But I personally think that quality-wise, Aquemini exceeds both those albums in many aspects. In terms of production, it's far more eclectic and is more versatile with elements of genres such as funk, soul, R&B, reggae, hard rock and country along with having some of the best hooks in the genre. In terms of subject matter, it is far more varied with issues of relationships, drug addiction, parenthood and the issues of living on this planet. Finally, when it comes to lyricism, Big Boi and Andr√© 3000 create wonderful poetic adventures that truly resonate with me as the issues that they tackle are more relatable to a wider audience.","I'll give you an upvote for the respectable opinion and the strong argument, but I don't agree. Aquimini is a musical tour de force that stomps plenty of the competition, but I'd argue it ain't even Outkast's best album... I'd give that to Atliens, which features stronger theming, and better chemistry between Big Boi and Dre. As for the decade's best, I would shortlist Ready To Die, Liquid Swords, Illmatic, The Score, as well as Atliens.",117
iye58r,"As someone who listens to music for several hours per day, it seems that new music does not hold my interest as long as it used to. Needless to say, the more you listen the less you have to discover. Is it inevitable that as we grow older we start to find less and less interesting music to listen to? Perhaps to the point where everything you listen to is just music that you discovered earlier in life? Surely, there are enough artists out there for a lifetime of discovery. But as someone with a very selective taste in music, I find it difficult to find artists that are original *and* impressive. Otherwise, it seems that the new artists I come across are just varying iterations of the same expression, with few that truly pull it off in a way that I find to be a new level among the others. I'm trying to be less picky about the things I find interesting. How do others deal with this inevitable point in life? Does one's passion for music simply dwindle with age or do you find different ways to stimulate your interests? Edit: Just got back from work and it seems the answer is a unanimous no and that I need to try harder, check out more genres, be more open etc. Btw thanks for my first award!

iyxfeh,"Since Rolling Stone released their new greatest of all time 500 albums this week to a polarizing response, I wanted to ask, do Greatest of All Time Lists even matter?  Of course, they help cement an artists legacy, but people are always fighting over which album is the greatest based on these lists, which usually have a negative response.  For Example, Rolling Stone clearly has a bias against acts like Pink Floyd, and especially rap music. But, they are strongly for pushing acts like The Beatles, or James Brown. NME, has a bias against acts like Bob Dylan and Older classics. They seem to love indie and contemporary music.  Does these greatest (artists/albums/songs) of all time do anything to help or weaken an artists career? Should they even be valued?

izbpv6,"The chorus is really what drew me to this conclusion. Hearing Miller sing, ‚Äúgood news is all the wanna hear; no they don‚Äôt like it when I‚Äôm down,‚Äù is heartbreaking. when you‚Äôre mentally ill often times people don‚Äôt care about your lows. Often times they‚Äôre dismissed with, ‚Äúfigure it out yourself,‚Äù or, ‚Äúyou have to love yourself,‚Äù well yeah no shit. But to instantly turn to the advice of you need to isolate, why? The second phrase, ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt like it when I‚Äôm down,‚Äù they don‚Äôt wanna see you at your lowest and help. They don‚Äôt care to wonder what it takes for you to come with good news they only care about the product; whether it was music for Miller or perhaps your personality if you‚Äôre just analyzing the song.  The second part of the chorus, ‚Äúbut when I‚Äôm flying it make em so uncomfortable. So different, what‚Äôs the difference?‚Äù It‚Äôs another example on why mental health stigmas are horrible. Even when you‚Äôre doing better, ‚Äúhow can you be depressed and happy, sounds like you need attention.‚Äù It‚Äôs almost like what‚Äôs the use? What‚Äôs the point in being open and honest, looking for help and trying to better yourself for people just to ridicule either way? When you‚Äôre down nobody cares to help, but when you finally find your footing it‚Äôs a problem. Taking miller‚Äôs personal tragedy makes this song hit even more. It‚Äôs time we stop chastising those who need help. If somebody opens up to you, don‚Äôt tel them to reflect or leave them. Company is something everybody needs and deserves. When you see them doing better, let them know, encourage them to keep going. I know I need somebody to help me, don‚Äôt miss your chance with those around you. Especially if you love them as much as you say you do.","Thinking about Mac Miller will never not be bittersweet. I still remember the exact moment I found out about his passing, and how cold the rest of the day felt. So odd, that we can react so strongly to a passing of someone who we don‚Äôt have any sort of interpersonal connection to, and yet it feels like losing a best friend. I agree completely and wholeheartedly that the stigma against mental health needs to end. Speaking from experience, dealing with things like depression and anxiety can make you feel so incredibly alienated from everyone in your life, and having those people treat it like it‚Äôs nothing makes you feel worthless.

j05kv8,"I find it interesting how one perceives and experiences music is dependent on their state of consciousness, in this post I will note some of my observations I have made whilst listening to music in various states, feel free to add your own experiences.  On alcohol (drunk), I am unable to critically analyse what I'm hearing, sober I will primarily decide whether I like the song based on the vocals but on alcohol I listen without judgment. Cannabis brings attention to elements I would not normally have focused on, an extra layer is revealed and time seems to have more space for the music to breathe.  Music whilst on psychedelics is an intense experience, the music is no longer solely directed inward, it becomes multidimensional, tangible, something more than just sound waves. Everything sounds positive on MDMA, even the darkest metal sounds warm and embracing. I have noticed that music seems to sound a lot faster soon after waking from a deep sleep, it is quite disorientating which is why I wait a few hours after waking to start playing music. In states of depression, music can sound stale, disconnected and irritating.  I see being sober analogous to flat sounding monitor speakers, no bias, no decoration, which is why I listen to newly discovered artists sober to experience the artistry as intended. Altered states are the speakers that add frequency responses, enhancements, the bells and whistles. The auditory system is so complex and sensitive, each person must have a slightly different experience due to the individual emotional and chemical response, some better are able to hear a wider frequency range and hear at higher volumes. I was born with poor hearing in my left ear, so the right ear processes 70% of the information I hear.   These are just my experiences and it won't be the same for everyone, I'd be interested to know the thoughts of others on this topic.","On the subjective nature of listening, you can tweak your auditory response by means other than chemical alterations (synthetic, mood-dependent, or sleep-cycle related) as well. Foreknowledge of what you are hearing can change how your brain processes the signals which effectively causes things to sound different to you. There have been a ton of studies in which cross modal experiences conflict and override one another - specifically the way in which visual stimuli change what you hear. Studies have shown that people identify beautiful people play music better even if it is the same sound sample overlaid digitally. If a drummer takes a long wind up before a beat strike which is always a fixed duration, we literally *hear* the note as being longer because our visual model tells us that is a reasonable assessment. If overlay strumming and plucking of an instrument but only show participants as doing one or the other, they will be unable to identify the component that doesn't align with what their visual system is telling them. It is almost like a more mundane form of synesthesia. There is an entire field called psychoacoustics dedicated to this sort of research and it is a fascinating subject.",106
j0lzgy,I was obsessed with this one song(King for a day by XTC) to the point that I kept listening to it over and over cause I was trying to transpose it to guitar and I just ruined my enjoyment of the song.

j1af42,"I wouldn't say that MCR is an underrated band, as they were really huge in the late 00's (and still are, especially after the reunion). But their somewhat cringe fanbase caused them a bad reputation from rock elitists, and that hid the fact that they are actually really talented songwriters imo. For those who don't know about them (idk how, but quoting Enter Shikari ""nothing is true and everything is possible""), they are a rock band often associated with the 00's emo trend: - their first album ""I brought you bullets, you brought me your love"" is a post-hardcore effort with a sound similar to bands like Thursday - their second record ""Three cheers for sweet revenge"" is more catchy, it gets rid of the hardcore influences and is a rock album with some punk traits and a goth aesthetic. It also has a very theatrical feel thanks to Gerard Way's over the top way of singing and performing. Songs like Helena and I'm Not Okay became huge - their third album ""The black parade"" is their magnus opus. No more punk influence, it is a very theatrical rock opera with influences from Queen and David Bowie. Songs like Welcome to the Black Parade, This is How I Disappear and Famous Last Words are the best at showing off their talent as songwriters and musicians. Welcome to the Black Parade has been called the Bohemian Rhapsody of the 00's, and I personally agree - the fourth and last record ""Danger days"" is a bit more controversial: for me it's really hit or miss, but overall I like it. The sound is very different tho, here we can find an upbeat pop-punk with some dance elements and a post-apocalyptic comic book theme Overall for me they are the kind of band that many people don't want to check out because of their fanbase and reputation, but then find out they're actually amazing. What do you think about it?","They're good performers and musicians though I'd say what made them stand out was Gerard Way's unique creative vision. As a visual artist and comic book guy he wanted to bring that sense of stylized art, drama and theatre to the band's music and videos. I'd argue their videos as much as their music were what took them from popular emo band to megastars - Helena and I'm Not Okay have such dramatic, iconic, stylized videos that the kids who loved them could watch over and over. It was as if the band doubled down on this approach during the The Black Parade era - a concept album with videos that reinforce the concept, and create an instantly recognizable visual accompaniment to the music that fans could identify with. They're the perfect example of a band that was a full multimedia package - the music, the album art, the videos and visuals, the online community and the live shows all tied together seamlessly, and they were hugely timely with the rise of the internet and the mainstream emo scene. A lot of artists have tried to capture the same fire since then, but I can't think of any that matched what MCR achieved from a marketing perspective. They were unashamed to be theatrical, which I think is a huge reason why some people loved them and others found them ""cringey"". I found a lot of the rock music that came from the emo scene at the time a bit too ""cool"" and not expressive enough - for me that made MCR a breath of fresh air and I think a lot of fans connected to them because they were so much more expressive and unashamed than their contemporaries. For the people who weren't into that kind of music, MCR was just everything they already disliked turned up to 11. The first three albums continue to hold up very well, in my view due to the song-writing, distinct vocal style and the way they blended the mainstream emo sound of the mid-2000s with sonic inspiration from older rock styles.",164
j1ttu2,"  As a music fan i can't help but notice that when rap comes up in conversations it often feels as it is heavily disrespected as a artform. I understand that rap is not for everyone but it comes off as people believe that it's lesser which i feel is just rude from production all the way to lyrics and subject matter i feel that some of the best projects from the past two decades have come from rappers and i feel a lot of the disrespect is unwarranted.    Rap from it's inception is rooted in storytelling and poetry very similar to other styles of music along with that a major part of rap is about the experience of being black in America it's as much political commentary as a painting from Th√©odore G√©ricault N.W.A, Public Enemy, and Tupac not only spoke on issues such as police brutality, systemic racism, and introduction of crack cocain into the black community. They also made party anthems which showcase not only range but the duality of having to push through the struggle and not being able to be sad at all times.   Personally I feel the only time i see rap being praised by ""music enthusiasts"" is when the song/album incorporates elements from other genres, (i.e Igor, Tyler The Creator) and while drawing inspiration from other genres is perfectly fine the message i receive from it is that rap is only valued when it incorporates something that makes the masses comfortable. 21 savage is no less artistic than Tyler The Creator just because his album is exclusively rap i feel like the narrative that is being painted is that rap is ""coll & hip"" but only has true value if it is infused with something else as seen by it's influence on nearly all pop production but it's lack of representation at nearly all prestigious award shows.   All and all i am a person who listens to all genres of music and feels that all art is beautiful but it feels that rap is being left out of many meaningful music conversations due to a certain stigma that surrounds it, I'm not sure when or why this narrative was created but i can't help but notice it. Rap compared to rock,jazz, and pop is a young genre but i feel that no genre has had to work as hard for mainstream approval as rap and i feel a large part of that is due to it being a predominantly black genre.","Speaking from the point of view of a white male who is an avid listener of primarily metal music: I honestly think you hit the nail on the head with the systematic racism. Growing up as a kid, my parents always steered me away from rap. Told me it was all about drugs and sex and excess and terrible things. I was explicitly told Dr Dre was an ‚Äúevil man‚Äù. Then, when I eventually heard rap music on the radio, what I was told just imprinted onto my opinion. I believed what I was told, and just dismissed it.  Later, I became very into metal music as a guitarist (which the community can be very elitist about), and back when forums were the place to talk on the internet, people would shit on rap. It was just the thing. THEN, I studied music academically, and that is even MORE elitist. The history of music is diluted into (mostly) German men from the 18th/19th centuries, and in the two years of music history I took, rap was never once mentioned. (Adam Neely has a WONDERFUL video on this exact topic on YouTube if you‚Äôre curious titled Music Theory and White Supremacy). So, ultimately, in my experience, it comes down to what you said. As a child, it was condemned. In my formative years, it was never praised. I only recently started getting into rap as a genre, and even then, it‚Äôs artists you mentioned that mix in other genres (Tyler the Creator, Frank Ocean, Childish Gambino, etc). I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with people not liking certain types of music. Perhaps ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù rap just isn‚Äôt my thing. But I‚Äôm thankful I‚Äôm at least listening in that direction after all these years. What it has to offer is genuine and unique. It‚Äôs intense, it‚Äôs heartfelt, and sometimes it‚Äôs fun as hell. Sure, there‚Äôs rap artists out there that may not be a glowing reflection of the genre as a whole, but every genre has that (and speaking from experience, metal has THE WORST music on this planet if you dig deep enough, lol). I‚Äôm thankful I‚Äôve given the genre an actual chance as an adult, and I hope others do as well. Promise you‚Äôll find something you like. Edit: forgot a word",272
j24geb,"We are now almost 4 years in Donald's Trump presidency. Many believed that his presidency would have a positive affect of the Punk scene in the US. Was this the case? I will argue that the past 4 years were in fact great years for punk music, but its unrelated to the presidency. ________________ The past 4 years were in fact pretty stellar for punk music. Here are some albums that came out that were critical successes and generally considered fantastic albums: * Jeff Rosenstock - Worry * Parquet Courts - Wide Awake! * Brand New - Science Fiction * Pup - Morbid Stuff * Idles - Joy as an Act of Resistance * Protomatyr - Relatives in Descent * Fontaines DC - A Hero's Death * Tropical Fuck Storm - A Laughing Death in Meatspace * Itekoma Hits - Otoboke Beaver * The Garden - Kiss my Super Bowl Ring  There are many other examples. You have bands like The Chats, who hit virality with their funny punk tunes. You see a lot of 90s era nostalgia in Indie rock these days with artists like Soccer Mommy, Beabadoobee, Snail Mail, Courtney Barnett, Narrow Head, and so on. These are sounds that are really influenced by punk rock in general.  So it is safe to say that Punk is alive and well, there is still great punk music these days.  __________ I believe this resurgence of punk is not due to a recent change of American politics however.  Many of these bands are not even American, first of all.  While a lot of the music I list are political, a lot of it isn't. And some of the bands that have been most direct in their opposition to the president are older bands that have reached legendary status, however their current output is just not as essential as the music of their heydays.  And when the current popular bands explore political themes it is often in a broader and more systemic viewpoint than just the Trump presidency.   I would always roll my eyes when someone said that at least a Trump presidency would be great for Punk music.  First of all, who cares? I would rather just live in a better world than worry about that.  But also, it is very likely that these artists would be making great essential music either way, even if Clinton won the election. These bands and artists are talented in their own right, and it unintentionally discredits these artists to assume they need a bad president to rally their angst around. Also, many of these bands existed before this presidency and released great music before it. And while so much essential and fantastic punk music are protest songs, and are political.... so much great punk music is not. ______ What do you guys think?","Nope. Low-hanging fruit will never be good for any artistic medium, the only thing it does is give extra visibility to the people shameless enough to take advantage for personal gain. Trump is the definition of low hanging fruit. It's too easy. People said the same thing about standup comedy in 2016, that Trump would make for a ripe comedic climate. It turned out to be the complete opposite--hack comedians that couldn't write a good joke on any other day of the week realized they could pull the Trump card to redeem themselves from poorly written jokes. Go to any open-mic today and see how uninspired the material is. When the state of affairs is more peaceful, it forces artists to dig deeper for their material. There's a certain kind of refinement and individuation that results from this process. When everything is out in the open, it fosters a culture of laziness where people are content to repurpose headlines or talking points from things they've read",395
j2lyvx,"You can see the entire tree as a single image here: https://i.imgur.com/32PIjhB.png You can also check out the music genre evolution tree of more specific musical categories for easier reading here (it's suggested that you open the images in a new tab): https://imgur.com/a/pbRiQNg The tree is divided based on the following categories for easier reading: Western Classical, Jazz, R&B, Hip Hop, Rock, Electronic Dance Music and Experimental, but they are still all appropriately connected to each other.  Some of you might remember I posted a chart of ""1111 essential recordings of music"" (https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/audxv2/i_made_a_chart_of_1111_essential_recordings_of/), and that chart was focused on transitional recordings of genres instead of later more popular alternatives. Well, this is the tree the categorization of that chart was based on, and the transitional recordings of the chart were chosen as a way to showcase the evolution of this tree. Something important to note is that every genre has only one parent, otherwise the tree would be an unreadable mess. The criteria to decide which genre was chosen as a parent genre was the genre that early recordings of the genre were part of. For example, Thrash Metal emerged as a combination of Speed Metal and Hardcore Punk, but early Thrash Metal wasn't actually Hardcore Punk, it was Speed Metal instead, therefore Thrash Metal has a Speed Metal parent, not Hardcore Punk. The same logic applies to nearly every other genre from the tree. The genres under Experimental are the exception to the previous rule, as they pretty much have no definitive parent genre, emerging out of new technologies and musical concepts instead of any specific musical style. Oh, currently all the nodes have a date, but a lot of those can be off by a few years, so please don't refer to them as the literal start of the genre, especially considering some genres have a lower date than their parent genre, which doesn't actually make sense. **I wonder then if any of you guys disagree with any of the links I drew on the tree and why.** I'm well aware some might be controversial, and some I already know are plain wrong (I will write those down as a comment here), despite having worked on this tree for two years and a half already. **Hopefully this will result in some interesting discussions about the origin of certain musical genres.** Anyways, I hope you like it, and have fun!","This is CRAZY!! Hats off to you. I didn't recognize how many different genres were around in the mid-late 20th century. The 80's for example, for me, I think metal, new wave, synthpop. It's cool how much deeper you were able to go with this! This will definitely aid in my musical exploration.",44
j30tnn,"I know the prevailing opinion on this sub (and the internet in general) is that it's currently a great time for music as a whole, now it's easier than ever to listen to new artists in your genre of choice, and that's an incredible thing. I totally agree with this, I love that with the click of a button, I will without a doubt discover a new artist, or a new song, in any genre of my choice. However, as someone who used to follow mainstream music, and completely immersed myself in the latest sounds and industry trends, I have never been so burnt out, exhausted, and frustrated in my entire life. I've been following mainstream music since the 90s, and at this point, I've completely had it. Gone are the days of a wide variety of different genres, sounds, an artists giving you a tasteful palate of a little bit of everything. Gone are the days with trying to push boundaries, finding new creative sounds and experimenting with different styles. Everything these days is just hip hop, or shitty hip hop influenced pop. It's absolutely dreadful. The top 100, dominated by shitty hip hop clones all making a variation of the same song as each other. Even pop's music production has been completely overrun and oversaturated with this 808 hip hop style production. The only time we get a variation of that are these cheesy over the top 80s throwback songs that strip away any subtly and are just so overdone at this point it's not even funny. And this isn't a ""hip hop bad"" post. That's not at all what I'm saying. It's a fantastic time to be a hip hop fan, and there's a plethora of amazing hip hop songs coming out every week. BUT THOSE AREN'T THE ONES GETTING PLAYED ON THE RADIO!!! Those aren't the ones amassing 100s of millions of views on youtube. It's only the shit that gets played, and it makes it even more frustrating. I'm just blown away as a lifelong fan of mainstream music. It honestly feels like I'm witnessing some dystopian Orwell event where the masses all listen to the exact same song over and over again and are completely satisfied. How do people stand for this garbage? Do people not care that the mainstream has lost all sense of variety and diversity of sound? Like I honestly baffled at how bad the current state is.","Yes. Look at the Migos, they had a good sound going and signed with a label. Instead of gradually evolving their sound, they just recycled the same flow on numerous songs, since that's what their label wanted them to do/ keep going. Sure, it got them hits after hits but where are they now, they're irrelevant. Their own fans don't want to listen to them since it's just recycled garbage they've all heard hundreds of times. Their burnt out, their fans are burnt out etc. The music industry now a days is find a new sound, ABUSE IT to drain as much as possible and move onto the next big thing.",195
j4f137,"As the Icons of Soundcloud-Rap died, the genre was shattered into pieces and spread out to the deepest darkest corners of the internet.  Millions of young kids experimenting with music in the late 2010s began their expeditions (in mom‚Äôs basement) looking for Peep-inspired sad guitar beats, distorted XXX beats or wavy Uzi Beats. The collective ADHD of our world has run these vibes dry.  Sad 4-Chord Guitar beats are played out, Rap Metal is no longer shocking, simply ‚Äúcool‚Äù, and the wavy uzi aesthetic seems to be fading too - only to be replaced with a more frantic fast paced beat with video-game inspired melodics To understand the next part lets assume an instrumental can be described as 2 part: Bass & Drums Melodies As the trap bass and drum patterns we‚Äôve been used to for the past 5 years has run dry, we see a return to EDM festival trap beats of 2014-16 (replacing 808s with distorted Saw waves and giant dance basses) as well as an expansion on ‚ÄòPlugg‚Äô beats  (not sure where they came from, but very atmospheric with hard drums and bouncy bass) We see artists like David Shawty, 100Gecs, and P4rkr creating a new blend of our emo-rap, glitch vocals, and raw electronic ideas Dubbed ‚ÄòHyperpop‚Äô or ‚ÄòGlitchcore‚Äô They are much more psychedelic, technical, and experimental (for now)  (Yet still on drugs a lot of the time) And then artists like Pierre Bourne, Summrs, and many others coming up on the other side of things from a purely ‚ÄòPluggnb‚Äô or plugg perspective - more ‚Äòtypical‚Äô hiphop and ‚Äòhood certified‚Äô My question is what is up next? A SoundCloud feed once full on sad guitar beats is now full of ‚Äòpop-punk‚Äô-esque modern trap beats with heavy focus on electronic melodies and a powerful singer or rapper. The 808 has slowly morphed from a background element of the beat into a lead instrument.  The tempo has gotten faster and faster capping out at 200BPM (fr, 180 is common) As the backbeat changes, the melodies change, and the singer‚Äôs flow changes.  Im so excited to see where it goes. Truly passionate :,)  I only know what I know, and these are the styles of music that have captivated me recently. Experimental pluggnb as well as electronic emo music. What are your guys thoughts? Am i ignorant to other sub-genres?",Trap as kind of been completely run dry at this point. Me and quite a few people I know or absolutely sick of it. And on top of that I've not heard anything that has really wowed me in the hip hop realm in quite a while. Personally I think bedroom pop is probably going to start taking over soon. most musical progress has been Frozen by covid as it is important to play shows to get a fanbase so this prediction is a bit further in the future,150
j4s7jq,"I‚Äôve always wrestled with the idea that an album can be ‚Äúoverproduced‚Äù. For me, I find that it‚Äôs easy to underproduce an album and leave out certain elements that would otherwise enhance the music (of course there are songs that are intently underproduced and still sound ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù, but that‚Äôs a topic for another day).  From what I can gather, an overproduced album is something that adds too many elements to the point that the music and concept is dampened; another definition is that an overproduced album is too polished and refined for what was actually intended.  For example, when Rolling Stone reviewed Kate Bush‚Äôs Hounds Of Love when it first came out, they said that she ‚Äúoften decorates her songs with exotica‚Äù and that she was ‚Äúnot concerned about having to perform the music live‚Äù, implying that it would be too difficult to recreate the album in a live setting. I never really understood that review, however. It sounded like everything on Hounds Of Love was intentional and appropriately placed. It was polished, but not too polished, and the so called exotica (i.e the helicopter blades toward the end of Waking The Witch) was incorporated very well and did not sound random. Additionally, all of The Ninth Wave was eventually recreated live, albeit in the recent modern age, but I don‚Äôt think that really matters; if you were able to produced the album with the technology you had back then, you‚Äôd most likely be able to recreate it live with the same technology. But I guess we wouldn‚Äôt know for sure.  Anyhow, what do you think constitutes as an overproduced album and can you think of any outstanding examples?","I think almost every popular a capella album (i.e. Pentatonix) is overproduced. A capella is about hearing voices, but most of the time it‚Äôs produced so much that they end up sounding pretty much like the instruments their mimicking, which defeats the whole point.",223
j52nma,"I really think that millennial's ""hair metal"" was metalcore for a ton of obvious reasons. Both music had a distinct type of fashion that bands copied from each other. Both of the genres got stale and sort of died off. Both had elements in their music that bands copy cat from each other (metalcore has breakdowns, hair metal has epic guitar solos) and I could go on and on.  Hair metal though however was much more popular and was on TV and was mainstream. Metalcore was extremely popular when I was in high school (I was born 1991) but guys in famous metalcore bands were not A-list celebrities.  Anyway, what do you all think ? Agree or disagree ?","It‚Äôs possible-depending on how you look at it, i think there are a few different candidates.  Post grunge sticks out to me. Hair metal was a watered down version of generally respected musical movements (glam, metal, classic rock). It made a bunch of money but 20 years on few people who weren‚Äôt there for it really care about it. Most of those bands, if they‚Äôre still touring, do the nostalgia circuit (casinos, fairs, etc.). New people still get into bowie and the new york dolls, but i dont hear much about poison or la gunns Post-grunge was a watered down version of grunge, was immensely popular, dominated the radio, had a distinct look (boring looking dudes in muted colors with bad facial hair), and 15-20 years on I don‚Äôt really see anybody being super into like three days grace or crossfade or whoever, unless they were around at the time. New people still like nirvana and pearl jam, tho",96
j5dffn,"I'm conflicted. I think the way some parents force their children to learn instruments at a young age somewhat defiles the ethos of music - to me it should always come from a place of inspiration/passion/spontaneity/creativity/curiosity NOT obligation/duty/education. There seems to be a persistent belief that by teaching your child an instrument you're priming them for success because it's a microcosm of general learning, plus it's sophisticated, plus it's a way to show off your parenting skills, plus it's what they were forced to do and so on.  When I say forced I mean forced to play music as though it's math or science, not just nurturing an interest in music.  The reason I'm conflicted is because I've got friends who were forced to play piano/violin/guitar/sing as children and a few of them (minority) actually ended up cultivating a lifelong interest in music.  I gravitated toward music via a friend who was forced to learn guitar (very few 8 year olds actually have the volition to want to learn an instrument) and that ended up being a life changing event for myself too as it inspired my love of music that exists to this day. So it's not a bad thing per se, I just feel like the reasoning behind it is questionable.","this question is kinda tricky.. I also believe that art should burst out from you. it can't be forced out. But if that child has chosen that spesific instrument, but after math like teaching or other backdowns, learning new stuff with instrument can feel kinda boring and you can't find motivation to it. In this situation i'd keep motivating the child and maybe change the teaching methods. But if it still feel like forced, then i'd ask what other things that child feel interest to. It's all natural to find your own interests as kid so nothing should be forced",99

It's an album that's reputation has grown broader over the years and I think, now, music fans have at least a familiarity with the album even if they've never heard it in full. I bought this album in the 90s, I want to say either 1996 or 1997. It wasn't hard to find, most music stores had an electronic music section and within that section were CDs like this one. I have the US version of the album that omits a song from the UK CD version which omits a song from the UK LP version.  The strange liner notes of the album really only make sense for the LP version. None of the songs are titled (except ""Blue Calx"" which had been released earlier) and the songs line up with pie charts for each side of the vinyl version. Completely unhelpful for a kid in America who has the CD version. That mystery is part of the allure though - what does any of this mean? The cover looks like some ancient relic, again without any hint as to what it is - a logo, but on what surface? I always thought it had been carved into stone. Kind of a letdown to learn later: it had been carved into a leather suitcase. What is not a letdown however is the explanation of why the music on this album feels both alien and strangely familiar. In a wide ranging interview with the then head of keyboard design at Korg, Richard D James talks about microtuning which is the key that unlocks the puzzle of this album: http://item.warp.net/interview/aphex-twin-speaks-to-tatsuya-takahashi/ Microtuning is altering the pitch of each note. Everything we hear in modern music is pitched to A440, the standard international tuning. Microtuning moves notes slightly out of pitch. It's here, especially on this album, where James coaxed notes into slightly off tuning in order to maximize their feeling. Some melodies feel drowsy, others spooky, others disorienting. For years I listened to this and just thought to myself ""HOW?"". How does he make these sounds that are so unearthly from standard equipment? The answer is he's a genius and he has a better understanding of his equipment than most any other musician from the period. There's no mystical answer, there's no sleepwalking answer, he's just better at making this music than his peers.",99

j6czuo,"I am devastated by the news. This is, unfortunately, another huge loss for the music world and rock world. Eddie Van Halen inspired so many after him and innovated rock guitar playing in ways we are still seeing today. Since this is Lets Talk Music, I figured I would start a discussion of all the ways we can see his influence in today's guitar playing. Of course, his bringing of two finger tapping to the mainstream is the biggest influence.","It‚Äôs become chic in some music circles to talk down Van Halen as just dumb party music for dumb middle Americans (and to be fair, it‚Äôs not like they were aspiring to make artsy hard rock). But fuck that noise, in their early years, Van Halen made lethally good hard rock that blew apart the genre and pumped new life into it, and Eddie‚Äôs playing was the primary reason behind that. It‚Äôs cliche to say that he ‚Äúchanged the way electric guitar was played‚Äù but it‚Äôs true: before him, everyone in hard rock was trying to be Hendrix or Page (and in the nascent heavy metal sound, Iommi or Blackmore). Yeah, because of him we got ridiculous shit like Malmsteen and Nitro, but no one calls Nirvana a terrible band because they‚Äôre responsible for Creed and Staind.  On a more personal note, I discovered Van Halen almost accidentally when my family moved houses one summer: I found the CD for their debut in a box, and decided to play it. It blew my 11 year old mind that you could even *do that* with a guitar. I never really aspired to be a virtuoso like Eddie, my tastes and skills always leaned more towards pure blues, but I always respected the hell out of what he did, even if others found it pompous. Rest In Peace.",264
j6slm2,"I don't know if this is actually what's going on, but since the 1940s there seems to be a continuous downsizing of the musical ensemble (from the big band or orchestra down to the rock band and now to the solo rapper with a ""type"" beat) that has been parallel with technological innovations: The 1940s-1950s saw the shrinkage of bands, partly due to WW2-related disruption but also due to improved microphone technology and recording techniques that allowed for singers to be heard over a full instrumental background without having to resort to melodramatic opera singing or Al Jolson-style belting. This yielded the traditional pop singer with instruments and the R&B combo. At the same time, on the instrumental side musicians were harnessing the power of the electron to amplify their instruments, allowing for a guitar or harmonica to make as much noise as a full string band. The late 1950s onward saw a number of further innovations, mainly using technology, that allowed rock bands to achieve a fuller sound; the ""recording studio as an instrument"" approach pioneered by Spector, Les Paul, and Meek that later was adopted by the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and Kraftwerk, for instance. In some cases these still used a large ensemble of instrumentalists doubling each other, but other cases were able to achieve a full sound with a small number of actual humans on the team. [Bobby Darin, for instance, recorded several songs with a doo-wop group composed of Bobby Darin, Bobby Darin, and Bobby Darin, sung at different pitches and recorded on top of one another](http://doo-wop.blogg.org/jaybirds-bobby-darin-the-c26505162). Naturally, these innovations would be taken up or paralleled by electronic musicians to achieve a rich sound with a small band, or even eventually just one guy at his or her laptop.  While rock and roll may not be a direct ancestor of today's electronic music and trap, it is (through Kraftwerk and through disco) at the very least an uncle of the modern electronic scene and one that was intimately involved in raising electronic popular music, and it definitely seems like the technological developments in rock allowed for one or two people to create a sound as rich as a full orchestra. Does this mean that the full band is endangered, or even obsolete, and how inevitable was the shift from large ensembles to just one guy and a type beat?","I think this is part a reflection of who plays music and where. Big bands and orchestras are definitely in the large end of the spectrum, and reflect a time in music where recordings were less available, if they were available at all. Orchestras were especially popular at a time when you had to go see music performed to hear it, and were played in concert halls with no electronic amplification. In a way, the bands grew to fill the halls. Then, big bands were a swelling of a more traditional jazz ensemble to fill those same halls. More players gives you more sound. In the early 20th century you would still find small ensembles and solo performers, just in different environments. Be it a roadside busker or a barroom pianist.  Rock bands come along and you can achieve massive arena filling sound by just putting up huge amps and micing them. You don‚Äôt need to pay more performers.  Then with hip hop/trap/etc I think it‚Äôs often just a question of money. It‚Äôs pretty exciting to see a ton of people on stage doing their thing, but it‚Äôs so much cheaper to jump in my accord with my iPhone and just jump on the mic at clubs. TLDR: I think it‚Äôs mostly a question of how money: for performers, venues, tickets, etc, and of advances in technology, as OP noted.",86
j7671k,"This may just be an isolated experience and me asking this might be pointless, but I have a feeling it's not. I am 18 years old and my friends and I when hanging out almost exclusively listen to the hottest rap music of the past ten or so years (Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Uzi, etc.) However, one notable exception to this that I have noticed is that OutKast makes very prominent appearances in all of our playlists. Everybody I know loves OutKast just as much as the newer generation of artists. This got me to wondering: Why is OutKast still beloved by Gen Z, while other contemporaries of them, much of whom were much more popular in their day (Nas, 2pac, Jay-Z, etc.), are almost entirely forgotten?  Big Boi did come on a Superbowl halftime show and Andre 3000 has made prominent appearances on Frank Ocean and Travis Scott records lately, but I think it goes deeper than that. I hypothesize that while lyrical tales of crime over mostly acoustic production have lost their relevance among most younger listeners, and OutKast, because they didn't really stick to that formula and were ahead of their time in their own day, didn't share the same fate. Their lyrical topics were much more humorous and relatable than their aforementioned contemporaries. Their production was much more experimental and of a sonically higher quality (just listen to records like ATLiens.)  But that's only half of it. They also didn't make the mistake of sounding like the next fad of rap music, the bling era, which ended up aging poorly. You don't hear a lot of teenagers blastic Xzibit, 50 Cent, or Jeezy anymore either, which makes it all the more strange that OutKast endured not one, but two distinct mainstream cultural shifts at least. This is my own hypothesis based on what little I know of music and if anyone has anymore concrete evidence of why OutKast has against all odds remained popular, or if you don't share the same experience as me, please share your response. I'm dying to know.  ATLiens YouTube link: https://youtu.be/ya3RhJUUZbk Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/1IaBCF26OjgYwUCEPaIyC0?si=j09NL7L5SKWvYLYv5eys0A",They existed outside of mainstream hip hop back then too. In a lot of ways people are just now catching up to them. Look at To Pimp a Butterfly. It‚Äôs blueprint was Aquemini. Plus Andre and Big Boi are two of the baddest who‚Äôve ever done it. Those two are insane. Where one stops the other picks it up immediately. It‚Äôs like connecting two roller coasters. You could release Stankonia right now and it would still sound ahead of its time. OutKast are fucking badass.,149
j7y9t8,"Used to be radio, having it on in the car, at work, in bars and other social gatherings, it just seemed to always be around, and usually just from radio and a few TV sources like MTV and late night shows, I suppose. But how does new music get around nowadays? Still radio and TV? Of course there's streaming, but I guess I'm asking because, like the title suggests, I have always gone after music intentionally, but how do people who just like music casually come across new music these days? Also I do mean more of how does music that people actually *like* get around, not so much heavily hyped and marketed music, but more like just good songs people like and remember for a long time, (not just what journalists tell them to remember).","Most people are intentional music fans in the past the cost to buy albums and etc was prohibitive so radio was a better option but with spotify or youtube people listen to tons of playlists. And the algorithms are smart, so Spotify wants you to stay on spotify as long as possible so it will recommend new music you haven't heard that it thinks you will like based on a multitude of factors. And the more you engage with spotify by liking and listening and removing songs from playlists the better it gets at knowing your taste. Across genres and decades and trends. So now if you have spotify there are playlists generated for you specifically, also some made for a task like studying ,or just what's popular now. And honestly now TikTok is the up and coming place where music just gets around. Well online content in general. So when people use songs in their tiktoks their youtube videos in their IG posts that keeps it moving and growing.",127
j8r9p5,"This question popped up in my head, and I felt like asking it here. I don't mean ""hate"" as in dislike, but rather something that you truly hate with a passion. Something that makes your blood boil and fuels you with rage listening to it.

j9e6xz,"Obviously, some genres have a very suitable time of year during which to listen (e.g., reggae during summer), but are there any genres, or bands, or even specific songs that you prefer during a certain season, or type of weather, or time of day, etc.?  For me, summer certainly comes to mind first, and reggae is the clear choice. But I also prefer mellow, acoustic-based, mid-tempo songs, as well as lo-fi, instrumental hip-hip. Winter puts me in the mood for modern alternative rock, math rock, or progressive music, all with very crisp, clean production (basically the opposite of lo-fi). Fall is another one that brings back to mind acoustic guitar, but more lush, strummed, full-sounding music. (That also sounds good first thing in the morning.)

ja8eok,"I was wondering this when I read a John Lennon quote that said this: 'When Elvis died, people were harassing me in Tokyo for a comment. Well I'll give it you now - he died when he went into the Army. That's when they killed him. That's when they castrated him. The rest of it was just a living death.'  People always say how his music in the 50s were great but after 1959, his music and image started to crumble. Do you guys agree with John when he said this?","This is a difficult one to answer. Before he enlisted Elvis was a fairly controversial figure, although he was extremely popular among teenagers a lot of older people viewed him as a negative influence on the youth so when he enlisted as a regular soldier it actually really helped with his reputation overall. When he came back to the US he was considered a war hero and the legion of parents, teachers and religious leaders who used to attack him had shifted their attacks to other younger and riskier rock stars who built on what Elvis has done before them. And yet to a lot of his hardcore fans a great deal of the appeal of Elvis was exactly because of the fact that he was so hated by their parents, it felt rebellious to listen to him so when he became respectable to their parents that aspects of his persona was just gone. That being said this was inevitably going to happen, it‚Äôs the cycle of the entertainment industry; a rock star comes along and everyone goes crazy over them, then people get bored and then go crazy over the next big thing.",159
jaobi3,"Not a favorite band, or album, or song. I‚Äôm talking about a specific *moment* within a song.

At the 1:00 mark, after Maynard sings the line ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs singing songs is a snake,‚Äù he very softly says ‚Äúit is....‚Äù Those two little words uttered create a magical moment for me.

jb7468,"In my earlier years I was very into jazz, jazz fusion, funk, etc.- genres where the bass line is (usually) very complex, in-your-face, and overall just a big part of the song. I've since kind of faded away from those genres, for a variety of reasons, but I still appreciate a good bass line now and then. And speaking of good bass lines, that's where Hozier comes in.  Hozier is by no means known for his complex bass lines, being primarily a singer-songwriter and blues/pop musician, but lots of his songs are hidden gems in that way. Take [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJywnUYHGxQ), [To Be Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyxfTqnUlRs), [Nina Cried Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_G5rdCxWTk), all these songs have amazing bass parts, but they're very quiet and hidden in the mix. When I first realized they were there, I thought, holy crap these are amazing, why aren't they brought forward more? I want them to be louder! But then the more I thought on it, I realized these bass parts shouldn't be mixed the same as a jazz-funk bass part, because they serve the song in a completely different way. Not better or worse, just different. They let Hozier's voice and lyrics take forefront, because that's how he works as a songwriter. They fit seamlessly into his arrangements, and bringing them out too much would probably mess with the washed-out, reverb-y sound lots of his songs have. Anyways this post is mostly just a Hozier bass line appreciation post, and also a realization that not all bass parts have to sound like Paul Jackson for them to be just as funky and effective!","I've had some similar thoughts on bass lately, or at least had some songs that really reminded me how important is and how much it can change the feel of a song. Parquet Courts' last album had such a funky backing to it, and the bass was a huge part of that. Songs like [Violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTrk8U9gqC0) are straightforward punk songs, but the bass (and to some extent, the organ / omnichord) gives it such such a funky feel. It was put forward fairly high in the mix on songs like [Before the Water Gets Too High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s65Zc6ULbo), so it was clearly an element they (and/or Danger Mouse who produced the album) wanted to draw focus to on the album.  On the opposite side of the spectrum is bass that is in the background but still provides a stable foundation for the music. Yo La Tengo's James McNew is such a consistent and restrained performer in an otherwise wildly diverse and experimental band. Whether it's super quiet songs like [I'll Be Around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJyjzHIgqr4) or long, loud jam songs like [Pass The Hatchet, I Think I'm Goodkind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4aCYqg44o4), he brings such hypnotic basslines. The latter song is kind of crazy because it's a 10 minute long song and the bass more or less stays in the same loop for the entire duration. Seeing this performed live, it was almost comical to see Ira Kaplin going insane with his improvisational guitar playing and sonic distortions, while James was in the background pumping out that same bassline over and over again. But it works, and it's the platform that, along with the drums, gives the song any sort of musical anchor for the listener.",125
jborg1,"The year is 1963, Marilyn Monroe is dead, the kids all across America love Elvis Presley and Bill Haley, and many young people in New York are checking out the new album by Bob Dylan, who mixes his music with social commentary. By the end of the year, JFK dies and the next year, the country is swept up by Beatlemania. But how did the musicals and crooners react? Think of Louis Armstrong, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Jule Styne, Dean Martin, Benny Goodman, Sammy Davis Jr, Richard Rodgers, Perry Como, Bing Crosby, etc.... Also the female singers like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and the singing film stars like Judy Garland, Debbie Reynolds, Doris Day, Rita Hayworth, Leslie Caron, etc... so many of them.  What was it about this music from the crooners and the old musical films that suddenly lost popularity with people? And how did these artists and their fans react? And why did it all eventually declined in popularity?",Their audience aged out. It‚Äôs happened time and time again. Big hair metal...aged out to grunge....there‚Äôs a pattern. Usually takes a big hit single to make the industry and taste pivot.,192
jcqino,"Looking at this from a historical point of view. It‚Äôs quite impressive how a group called ‚ÄúNiggaz wit Attitudes‚Äù can just make up a song called ‚ÄúFuck tha police‚Äù in 1988 and win immense popularity and sales.  It‚Äôs something extremely unique, historically speaking.  Here you have a group of people saying to hell with the law enforcement and everybody is chill with it. Even in 1988. More people in America got offended by John Lennon when he made that Jesus comment than when NWA released that album. In 1989 it received gold certification.  Bob Dylan and John Lennon released some very bold and shocking songs in their time but none of them were as graphic as ‚ÄúFuck tha police‚Äù and ‚ÄúGangsta Gangsta‚Äù  It really makes me think of the limits of free speech.  Why was the American government so chill with it? Were they not worried this would create a resentment? Bonus Question What is a popular song with the edgiest lyrics in the past ten years? Are we moving away from music with edgy lyrics?","So first off, the American government wasn't cool with it. The FBI sent NWA a ""warning letter"", which was basically a threat. Police refused to do security for their shows, harassed the group, etc. All of this added to their publicity as the ""world's most dangerous group"". They sold in the hood cause it was relatable, they sold in the suburbs cause it was rebellious, the same way punk and rock n roll had before it.    On top of all this it was just a new and exciting sound, there was really nothing else like it in '88. Yeah, there was Public Enemy but they were on a conscious tip that was going over a lot of heads, especially suburban white kids. NWA was agressive, over the top and explicit in a way that appealed to the fuck you attitude that basically every teenager since the beginning of time has had.     Hope this answers your question!",773
jdgxch,"The Weeknd is arguably the biggest artist right now. He is currently number 1 for listeners on Spotify and has been for at least the past few months. He‚Äôs clearly blown up and has been front of the pack for at least the last couple years.  Starting out as an indie R&B artist with his release of 3 consecutive EP‚Äôs that quietly took the music world by storm with their unique sound and production, he later cemented himself in the mainstream with catchy hits that garner nostalgic dance music sounds from other decades and are very radio-friendly. There is clearly somewhat of a revival of this 80‚Äôs pop music going on right now. My question to you guys is; did The Weeknd usher this in himself, or did he just ride the wave very successfully? And if it wasn‚Äôt him, who was it? Or was it multiple artists?","I mean he came up because his dirtier styled r&b which was different than anything else out when combined with his voice aNd was very original.  Tie this to smart business decisions of working with drake.  But this original style couldn‚Äôt sell mainstream bc of the lyrics so  he changed everything about himself from his sound to his hair to fit a generic pop mold. Obviously it worked out great for him, pop sells on another level and we see this all the time from nicki Minaj to post Malone.  To answer the question, he certainly brought it on himself through originality, hard work, and smart business decisions, but is now just riding the same pop wave as everyone else who reaches this level.  Good for him, worked to get there, time to get paid.",159
jeel76,"This thought process was triggered by my re-reading of the book *Beatles '66: The Revolutionary Year* ( a book I highly recommend to audiophiles, Beatles fans, and music nerds all around.) The Epilogue addresses how the Beatles had an interest to ""stretch the limits"" of pop music, explaining how this was no precedent for this in rock and roll. It talks about how figures like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Gene Vincent either stuck to a formula or ""went back to the roots music that had existed before rock n roll."" The ONE exception they made though, interestingly enough, was for Buddy Holly.  >The one artist who almost certainly would have experimented was Buddy Holly, who had moved from Lubbock, Texas, to live in Greenwich Village and had plans to write for film, do a gospel LP, record with Ray Charles, and set up his own studio at the time of his death in 1959.  First of all...wow! I had no idea about any of this. I would've loved to have heard a Buddy Holly Ray Charles collaboration. That's also pretty wild that he had moved to the Village, just right before/around the time that the local folk scene was picking up speed, no? I wonder if that would've impacted his music.  I did a bit more digging on Wikipedia and found this:  >Holly and Santiago (his wife) frequented many of New York's music venues, including the Village Gate,  Blue Note, Village Vanguard, and Johnny Johnson's. Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar and that he would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there. Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll. He wanted to make an album with Ray Charles and Mahalia Jackson. He also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasberg's Actor's Studio. Similarly, it would've been interesting to see if the NYC jazz clubs would've impacted him. The final sentence probably intrigues me the most though: it would've been fascinating to see what impact he would've explored in the film world. If he DID turn to acting, I'd like to imagine that, rather than phoning into Hollywood schmultz that Elvis dived headfirst into, with the influence of the Actor's studio, Holly might've explored more gritty independent Cassavetes type stuff. Or maybe soundtracked it at the very least. All speculation of course. Wikipedia also talked about how he was breaking into producing, doing so for Waylon Jennings.  All in all though, it sounds like Holly was on the cusp of making some really cool musical explorations. Which makes his premature death all the more tragic. It's like a what if that'll forever haunt music.  What do you make of all of this? What do you think the 60's would've looked like for Mr. Holly? What do you think he would've thought of the Beatles? Do you think he might've impacted music maybe more-so than he already did before he passed on? All big questions with uncertain answers, but I figured that this sub was the perfect place to get a discussion going!","Buddy was already experimenting in the studio. It's interesting to hear the evolution of his recorded output, from his first recordings to his last. I have no doubt he would've continued that trend.",76
jeofy6,"As a kid, my Dad always had the John Denver greatest hits playing in the car so I was always familiar with his songs. It wasn't until I started learning music in my twenties that I now truly appreciate how great he was. It's a shame many younger people may only know him for Country Roads because he's got some absolutely fantastic songs such as ""Leaving On A Jet Plane"", ""Annie's Song"" and ""Sunshine On My Shoulders"". For the most part, he's considered a country singer, which when comparing him to contemporary overproduced country singers such as Blake Shelton and Tim McGraw, its just crazy to hear the difference. Although there are plenty of other contemporary talented country musicians such as Colter Wall and Tyler Childers, there's something about John Denver's songs and playing that is tragic in that for the majority of non-country listeners he's just known as that guy who sang Country Roads.","Yeah, John Denver is great. Rocky Mountain High is probably my favorite of his.",117
jf873o,"Thought I‚Äôd consult reddit over a debate I was having with my friend this morning: Who were the better & more influential band - The Velvet Underground or The Doors? Both bands are highly-respected and influential, were primarily based from 1967-1973 and both bands contained cult-status frontmen in Jim Morrison & Lou Reed. I went with The Velvets without having to give any second thought, but he he reckons The Doors (I adore both, however). Who would you go for?","Personally I think it‚Äôs VU no question, but I think The Doors are more prominently known following their respective hay days. I feel like if you take someone who really has no direct appeal to either band, they‚Äôre gonna recognize a song (maybe a few honestly) by The Doors before VU. But if we‚Äôre taking into consideration mystique, image, and style I‚Äôm going with VU. Working with Nico, Andy Warhol, and purely the DIY type sound they naturally had since their wake, to me it almost feels like music was changed forever by them.",244
jflq9o,"I have a decent knowledge of classical music, though I'm no expert, so some of this might be wrong. But as I've heard it, classical and baroque music relied on a strict set of rules without much variation. It was all very mathematical and stuck to a narrow method of music theory. That's why, when Beethoven created music that sounds almost archetypal to us, they said he was ""blurring the line between music and noise."" I'm not saying that classical music couldn't be evocative. The Requiem certainly is. But there were certain things that music could and couldn't do. So my question is whether Mozart or other composer, pre the Romantic movement, would be able to appreciate 19th century music? Would they understand the more emotive compositions or dismiss it as avart garde experimentation?","So I remember hearing a scenario similar to this in Robert Greenberg‚Äôs audiobook for *How to Listen To and Understand Great Music*. For one thing, most Baroque composers would be somewhat more stringent about proper voice-leading and other techniques, while Classical composers like Mozart tend to move in slightly more rule-breaking direction (but is still rooted in a stable organization of music). So someone like Monteverdi might be just as disapproving of Mozart as any late Romantic composer. Mozart likely would have loved or at least appreciated Beethoven, given that the two existed closely in time (Mozart was only 14 years older). Later Romantic composer like Wagner or Brahms likely would have sounded fine albeit somewhat experimental, although some like Liszt might have been too ‚Äúintensive‚Äù. Debussy‚Äôs really in a grey area that bridges over into the modern era; I could be wrong but, to my ears, his/other impressionist music isn‚Äôt extremely dissonant or abrasive, so Mozart may have been fine with it (while possibly also considering it amateurish for its voice movement). As for composers like Stravinsky and Schoenberg, I comfortably feel that most composers prior to 1850 would be put off.",85
jg37m2,"During my teens, when exploring the artist of the 60‚Äôs I hated Bob Dylan‚Äôs sound & dismissed his music, while musically over-dosing on the sounds of psychedelia.

jgkotn,"Look, I get that most people in this community don't like this album but if you've known me for a while you know how I feel about this album. I absolutely love it and I will explain why I enjoy it so much.  The songwriting is some of the most well thoughtout and deeply woven I've heard in folk or any genre, most people may just dismiss it as cynical and pretentious but its actually very clever and weaves an enjoyable sense of humour that Tillman has been known for throughout his career while also conveying a very powerful message especially on tracks such as Leaving LA and So I'm Growing Old On Magic Mountain. The lines that generally stand out include: ""Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips And so nature, she devised this alternative: We emerge half-formed and hope whoever greets us on the other end Is kind enough to fill us in And babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since"" ""So says the dying man once I'm in the box Just think of all the overrated hacks running amok And all of the pretentious, ignorant voices that will go unchecked The homophobes, hipsters, and one percent The false feminists he'd managed to detect Oh, who will critique them once he's left?""

jgxzmg,"Two questions here, I know... but I've pondered on this for a while.  Hollywood has always tapped sources from other forms of media to turn into film and television.  Be it novels, comic books, video games, internet memes....etc.   But one source you almost never see adapted into film or television is the concept album.   Why is that?   I get that alot of the various (story driven) concept albums out there do not have the clearest of narratives, and are often convoluted (due to the music being the main driving force and having to fit the lyrics/story to that)... but that's not the case all of the time.  There are just as many concept records out there with clear narratives, with clear characters and story arcs..etc.  Great stories that would absolutely lend themselves to adaption.  Even moreso, because of the fact that there is the template for a score built right in..  That to me would be the greatest draw, not only to see how the story would be adapted, but how a director/musical director could re-work the original music within that new format.   So why?  Why are there so few examples of this being done,  it seems to me that there is a goldmine of great stories out there that could reach alot more people if screenwriters knew where to look.  -------------------- Secondly, if Hollywood were to start tapping concept albums for adaptation into film/televison, what albums would you like to see, and why?  What albums do you feel have a compelling story that could make for a great film or TV series (long-running, or limited series)?  My personal go-to example would be ""Still Life"" by Opeth.   It's a concept album about a religious outcast from a rural community long ago (I imagine 14th/15th century), to reconnect with the woman he loves after several years apart.  He is able to reconnect with his love (Melinda), but this pisses off the elders of the village and things get out of control in a very violent climax, with Melinda dead, and the protagonist going on a killing spree in revenge.  The album ends on a bittersweet note with his execution but reunion with his love as he is hanged.    I would love to see this brought to a mid-budget film.  It would be an excellent period piece, but have that rated-R draw in that budget range.    Secondly, am I the only one that wants to see ""The Amory Wars"" adapted?  The Amory Wars is the large over-arching story that connects the entire discography of the band Coheed and Cambria.   The plot is a bit convoluted, but it's very much a rated-R Sci-Fi epic.  The only hindrance being that to do the story proper it would have to be rated-R, and given the setting/story beats, it would also require a pretty substantial budget.  Those two things don't often mix, but I can see them getting around that by making it a series and animating it.   Put that on Netflix or on Amazon Prime and I will binge the hell out of it.     There are a few others I could list, but Ill leave you all to that for now.","The only concept album turned movie I've seen is Tommy. Tommy is not a good movie. Great album, bad movie.     I think part of the problem with turning a concept album into a movie is that you have to like the band to see the film. No one is going to pay to see a movie where you have to sit thought a bunch of music from an artist you don't like. And for people who do like that artist, many would rather just listen to the album. If you are trying to adapt it without the music, what's the point?",159
jh5sug,"# [Everywhere At The End of Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJWksPWDKOc) This album's purpose is to tell the listener through music on what it's like to be undergoing dementia. It portrays a gradual, but terrifying deterioration of the human mind consisting in confusion, failed remembrance, terror, and eventually the complete loss of self. It is a six and a half hours mega album with six parts, each of which represents a separate stage of dementia. Each part has the following descriptions described nicely by the uploader of the album in the provided link (vwmtest): &#x200B; **Stage 1:** Here we experience the first signs of memory loss. This stage is most like a beautiful daydream.  The glory of old age and recollection. The last of the great days. **Stage 2:** The second stage is the self realization and awareness that something is wrong with a refusal to accept that. More effort is made to remember so memories can be more long form with a little more deterioration in quality. The overall personal mood is generally lower than the first stage and at a point before confusion starts setting in. **Stage 3:**  Here we are presented with some of the last coherent memories before confusion fully rolls in and the grey mists form and fade away. Finest moments have been remembered, the musical flow in places is more confused and tangled. As we progress some singular memories become more disturbed, isolated, broken and distant. These are the last embers of awareness before we enter the post awareness stages. **Stage 4:** Post-Awareness Stage 4 is where serenity and the ability to recall singular memories gives way to confusions and horror. It's the beginning of an eventual process where all memories begin to become more fluid through entanglements, repetition and rupture. **Stage 5:** Post-Awareness Stage 5 confusions and horror. More extreme entanglements, repetition and rupture can give way to calmer moments. The unfamiliar may sound and feel familiar.  Time is often spent only in the moment leading to isolation. **Stage 6:**  Post-Awareness Stage 6 is without description. &#x200B; I'm not going to spoil too much of the details of the composition of the album as it's better to go in this album somewhat blind, but it initially starts with old time inspired ambience (made entirely digitally impressively) and that same music goes through a gradually, but dramatic change and it gets more scattered and loose as the album drags on. This is the Caretaker's (James Leyland Kirby's) final piece before he retired, that was split into four separate releases: Stage 1 in 2016, Stages 2 & 3 in 2017, Stages 4 & 5 in 2018, and Stage 6 in 2019 as well as a separate album [Everywhere, an Empty Bliss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI7bfO9eZuE) in 2019 which consisted of the unused pieces in the 6-staged album. This album for me was a very long and intense, but interesting listen and I would personally recommend to listen to it in one sitting as it was meant to be listened whenever you make yourself the time to do so as it's one of my favorites of the decade. Feel free to discuss.","I‚Äôve never heard of this before. In all seriousness, it‚Äôs something I really want to listen to but I‚Äôve read so much about it in the last few months.

jhr2ms,"I was listening to Magma, and remembered the tidbit that 80s snooker champion Steve Davis was a massive fan of the band, to the extent where he organised some mid 2000s London gigs by the operatic ensemble, simply because nobody with the funds was willing to take a punt. And I was reading a recent interview with Barney from napalm death in the quietus, and he insists Ed milliband is a real fan of the band because he knew so much obscure trivia during a radio interview he couldn't have possibly just been briefed. That's all pretty british, but I was also thinking of how Luke Skywalker himself came out as a massive fan of brainiac. His star power was actually quite useful in the kickstarter push for the recent documentary. Any other examples of public figures who are seemingly on the straight and narrow, who turn out to have really bizarre music taste? Just to prove the meek will eventually inherit the earth.

Someone pointed out that Matt Groening liked Frank Zappa a lot. Frank Zappa, at least at the start of his career, had the notion his music was a political force. If he could convince one small town kid, as he was, to question everything he figured his music had achieved it's potential. He influenced a lot of people but remained a cult musician. He influenced Groening and at the time the Simpsons was anything but a cult show. There was a strong cynical streak through the whole cartoon. We live in manage where articles and statements made by public figures are constantly well calculated PR. With Obama, he may or may not like the music he talks about but it does also further his own brand as the cool president.

jj8nmt,"About 5 years ago, I was an awful music snob. I listened to a lot of different genres and different artists, but everything beyond what I liked, was shit music. I had great respect for some pop artists, but generally, everything that was top 40, was horrible and low quality by default. Even my friends told me that I became a horrible person when talking about music. At some point I noticed that my friends didn't want to talk about music with me anymore, because I'd always talk them down anyways. I guess that's the point when I realised something needed to change. I decided to start judging music in a different way, just listening to everything that got on my path and seeing good side of everything I heard. Around that time, I started studying music production at the conservatory, which helped a lot. I met a lot of people who were (maybe to people's surprise at a conservatory) super open to any type of music.  Honestly, it is one of the best things to happen to me in my life. I enjoy listening to music way more now, as I'm not super picky and judgemental. My horizon has expanded so much and my friends enjoy sharing en talking about music with me again! A couple of weeks ago, I was loudly singing along with some top 40 pop song with my friends, and one of my friends said ""It's so crazy to realise that you were such a horrible music snob 4 years ago!"" That honestly made me so happy! Has there been a moment in your life when you realised being a snob about everything just isn't worth the energy and can even be limiting? How has your music listening experience changed since?","Top 40 isn't in itself bad, IMO. Individual songs can be bad. But making music that appeals to a wide range of people isn't a bad goal in itself -- creating universal, shared cultural experiences through music is a GREAT thing, IMO. Music made with the sole purpose of helping people dance or have fun is a great thing too, IMO. And there is an art to it -- not everyone can make a good pop song. Creating music that appeals to a niche is also not bad. There are many fine goals in music making.",149
jjfr2d,"Like a lot of metalheads, I was a bit elitist and tended to be against anything mainstream or, god forbid, pop music.

As well as delving into other obscure genres. Suddenly I‚Äôm listening to a lot more than just metal and it‚Äôs incredibly refreshing and honestly, eye opening.

jkx5wp,"I ""grew out"" of The Killers circa 2009. *Day and Age* was weak and forgettable, and ""Human"" still makes dry-heave whenever I recall its blatant disregard for the rules of common grammar. Although the band had been hugely important to me during my pre-teen/early-teen years, I kind of put them on the shelf and never thought back to them. Right, ""Mr Brightside"" would come on in a club every now and then, and I'd go wild. But I never returned to their first two LPs, which at one point sat in my top-ten favourite records.  About a month ago, however, I decided to return to them on a whim, and was surprised by how much held-up.  I still think *Sam's Town* as a whole is pretty fucking dumb and melodramatic... But ""Read My Mind"" is gorgeous, a beautiful ode to frustration, one of Brandon Flowers' finest lyrical moments. The other highlight is ""For Reasons Unknown"", a song about falling-out-of-love and/or growing old, a daring conceit that somehow pays off as tragic and moving. Not much else on *Sam's Town* invited further investigation, not even ""When You Were Young"". But *Hot Fuss* blew me away. I didn't remember this album being so raw! The arrangements are delightfully clamorous; Flowers' vocals seem off-the-cuff and spontaneous (especially compared to how overcooked his voice would later sound). Ronnie Vannucci Jr drumming is way above your average indie-band's. *Hott Fuss* ain't exactly *Up the Bracket*, but you bet it rocks out.  Ultimately though, indie bands live and die on their front person. Brandon Flowers isn't one of the greats: he's neither as deep as Jack White; as smart/sexy as Julian Casablancas; or perceptive as Alex Turner. But on *Hot Fuss*, he manages to gather meaning from his confusion with the world: he's got ideas on what it means to be a man which are only half-formed; he's jealous, and mixes up lust with love and vice versa. Most importantly, he seems somewhat aware of all of this.  ""Jenny Was a Friend of Mine"" is his most ambitious moment: he imagines himself as the Robert Chambers, murderer of Jennifer Levin, and delivers a performance that is indignant and repulsive. ""She couldn't scream whilst I held her close/ I swore I'd never let her go"" is a very uncomfortable look into the mind of killer... You get the feeling that the narrator is incapable of understanding the evil of what he did. This type of songwriting could have been an awful misfire, but it works. Flowers then delivers a fabulous trilogy of songs about lust, love and everything in between (""Mr Brightside""; ""Smile Like You Mean It""; ""Somebody Told Me""). He was only 22 when *Hot Fuss* was recorded, definitely close enough to his teenage years to remember how frustrating that period can be when it comes to romance, and he gives startling and pained performances. This is the album's definitive peak, but there are other highlights. ""On Top"" was a great track that I totally forgot about; ""Midnight Show"" is one of the horniest songs in the indie canon. But my personal favourite is ""Believe Me Natalie"", an urgent song about trying to enjoy life whilst there's still time. Those trumpets set me off with every listen.  Right, *Hot Fuss* is far from fucking perfect. ""All These Things That I've Done"" has one of the most ridiculous bridges I've ever heard (I recall Bill Bailey's brilliant parody, ""I've got ham but I'm not a hamster""). ""Andy, You're A Star"" is vapid filler. The synths that pepper the album only work 70% of the time. And whilst Flowers' worldview is interesting, it is limited. In the end, *Hot Fuss* is not a classic a la *Is This It* or *White Blood Cells*. But I'm glad I returned to it after all these years. What are your guys' thoughts on The Killers first two albums? Am I too harsh? Too generous? A penny for your thoughts?","While I agree with a good 95% of your post, I have to vehemently disagree with your assessment of ""All These Things"". That song is a straight banger, even if the lyrics are a bit silly. Don't tell me you haven't lost your dang mind when that part crescendos! If you haven't, I highly suggest going for a drive and signing along alone. Worth it.  Final thoughts: While Hot Fuss has been consistently in my Top 5 Of All Time since its release, Sam's Town didn't even come close, but you rightly call out Read My Mind as a standout on that album. It fills me with ""that feeling"" that only the best songs can do.  If you haven't already, I would highly suggest you check out their latest release, Imploding the Mirage. I can't stop listening to it. It's very reminiscent of their early stuff, but with new influences like The War on Drugs and such. I would put it almost as high as Hot Fuss in my mind, and it's only just a few months old at this point. Thanks for the fun post!",109

Now it seems like artist release an album every 5 years or so (give or take). But that used to be career suicide in a way. What changed? And I know the guy behind Spotify is a dick for saying that artists need to put out more material in the age of streaming, but do you think we might see a switch back to this?","I think it just sort of happened over time, not really an event you can point to for it, but let's look a little more at the two examples you gave.    So for The Beatles, a lot of their early albums were made up of a mix of original songs and covers. They stopped doing covers later in their career, but they also stopped touring. That combined with have two of the most prolific song writers of their day meant they put out a lot of music.       With Led Zeppelin, they put out 4 albums from 1969-1971. Two in 1969, one in 1970, and one in 1971. After that their album production slowed down. Across those first four albums, they only actually wrote about half the songs they recorded. By my count at least 44% were not written by the band. Looking more closely at 1969 (the year they had 2 albums), they wrote at most 45% of the songs off of those two albums. So while they were putting out more than album a year, they were not writing an album a year.",161
jm3zj4,"As a piece of post-rock, I think *F# A# ‚àû* by Godspeed You! Black Emperor has proven itself to be one of the greats. At this time in history -- quite a significant, and soon-to-be infamous, one when you think of it -- its sentiments loom larger than life. What I want to know is what you deduct from the instrumental conversations on the record. I've heard a lot of analysis of the contrasting placement of 'pessimism and hope', which I myself very much hear and feel. Track one opens with the most painfully-sombre monologue you could imagine: &#x200B; >The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel   >   >And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides   >   >And a dark wind blows   >   >The government is corrupt   >   >And we're on so many drugs   >   >With the radio on and the curtains drawn   >   >We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine   >   >And the machine is bleeding to death I think what ensues afterwards was actually perfectly summed up by Pitchfork: ""The voice continues as mournful strings enter, playing a theme wracked by sadness and loss, the sound of the band on the deck as the ship goes down."" And then there's that optimism; the poignant conversation between pessimism and hope, love and loss, the present and the future. We are crushed by despair, yet we find in a fragile instrumental a flicker of possibility. As a means of not spoiling the record, I'll leave it here -- but I'm very interested to hear what you think of the soundscape and its larger importance. What does it mean to you in this pandemic, where the antagonism of the government has become all-too-visible? Coming to a US election, watching the rise of nationalism and fascism, witnessing the political landscape burn to the ground. I feel it at once corroborates and enlightens the meaning of *F# A# ‚àû*: it is something we ***need*** at this point in time. I'll leave this with my favourite lines from the record, which actually fall at the end of the first track: &#x200B; >I said: ""kiss me, you're beautiful -These are truly the last days""   >   >You grabbed my hand and we fell into it   >   >Like a daydream or a fever   >   >We woke up one morning and fell a little further down   >   >For sure it's the valley of death   >   >I open up my wallet   >   >And it's full of blood",I‚Äôve heard dead flag blues described as a post apocalyptic wasteland that is slowly being illuminated by the sun rising.,89
jmomaz,"Enough months have passed since its release for me to now feel certain of my opinion: RTJ4 is the duo's best, and one of 2020's finest records. El-P and Killer Mike have assembled one of the strongest discographies of the modern era, and for me RTJ4 is the crown jewel. Although it lacks a surefire, fun hit, a ""Legend Has It"" or ""Nobody Speak"", it more than compensates with its consistency and chilling bravery. Comparisons to Public Enemy won't do: I feel like no one has combined this much compassion, political savviness, hope and rage since The Clash's London Calling. True, it's not as  musically innovative as that record, but it's still pretty damn daring: the ridiculous chorus of ""Ooh la la""; the big bass and De La Rocha screams of ""Ju$t""; the crunching beat of ""Out of Sight"". Right, beatwise it's no It Takes a Nation of Millions... But musically it reminds me of The Marshall Mathers LP and Ready to Die, where the beats operate primarily as a vehicle for the raps. And boy, are the raps a doozie. Killer Mike has always been a master MC, fiercely intelligent and gratifyingly direct. Honestly, he's as consistent as he's always been on RTJ4... Only this album also comes packed with the best verse he will ever write. On ""Walking in the Snow"", he makes the connections between broken education systems, poverty, incarceration, police brutality, media fear-mongering, and the ever present threat of racism. He does so seamlessly and without ever losing his sneering pace (or his sense of hope for a better world). He packs more brains into that verse than most rappers do in their whole career. It's his lyrical peak, which is not to say the rest of his raps don't pack their usual punch. Check out this genius couplet from ""the ground below"" : ""Not a holy man but I'm moral in my perverseness/ So I support the sex workers unionizing their services"". As for El-P, in the past he's frequently been smart and lyrically acrobatic. But I'd argue he's often lacked the same level of, er, ""soul"" as Killer Mike. Not so on RTJ4. He really does sound like he's putting his rage-filled heart on the line, like he's only just realising the true consequences of the evil he's pit himself against his whole life. He also delivers a career-defining verses, this time on ""a few words for the firing squad"": ""I used to wanna get the chance to show the world I'm smart/ Isn't that dumb? I should‚Äôve focused mostly on my heart/‚ÄòCause I seen smarter people trample life like it's an art/So bein' smart ain't what it used to be, that's fuckin' dark."" In the verse that follows, he defines himself not by who  he's fighting against, but who he's fighting for: the unheard masses. His compassion and courage are nothing short of startling. From the excerpts I've chosen, you might think this is a bleak album. And yes, it's pretty damn heavy. But it's also fun and hopeful: RTJ know they might lose the good fight, but they couldn't live as anything but defiant. Maybe RTJ2 is more musically interesting, but I found RTJ4 to be far more moving. In politically charged music, that's rare. What do you guys think of RTJ4? A penny for your thoughts?","Besides it being a perfect album for its time, it‚Äôs my favorite of theirs for its consistency.  While there may not be as MUCH of the peaks of the previous three, there are no lows. So much has been written about how great this album is so I feel I can‚Äôt contribute more. All I can say is that ‚ÄúYankee And The Brave‚Äù is the best opening track they‚Äôve ever done, and creates such a high bar for the rest of the album.",105
jn391k,"In the 20th Century, we had a lot of great and iconic artists. Elvis, Michael Jackson, Madonna, The Beatles, Queen, Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, etc. However, it seems like we have yet to experience the impact in the 21st Century. So do you think an artist will become as big or as iconic as the people I mentioned? I thought about it and here are a few artists: Britney Spears - At one point, she was the biggest pop star. Her prime was very impactful and we've never experienced that impact in pop music again.  Eminem - Without Eminem, rap probably wouldn't be the dominating genre it is today. In a way, he's kinda like what Elvis did to rock. Except that rap was popular in the USA, but not as popular outside of the US. Eminem really made people take rap seriously and now hip hop has fans of all races and a lot more people accepting of the culture. Kanye - After Kanye beat 50, he forever changed hip hop. Before, hip hop was gritty and was mostly gang-related. But now you have all types of non-gang affillated people coming onto the scene. Drake, Kendrick, J Cole, etc. Not only did he change rap, he changed music period and if I had to choose, he'd probably be my pick for this century's forefront.","I know this isn‚Äôt answering your post, but saying most hip hop before Kanye was gritty and gang related is insane. You‚Äôve forgotten the literal ‚ÄúGolden Age of Hip Hop.‚Äù Gangster rap won the sub genre battle in the early 90s, and it was constantly in the spotlight due to controversy, but there were many, many famous groups who weren‚Äôt gangsters.",337
jprcut,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was not the first person to submit for approval [1988 as the worst year in music.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lewronggeneration/comments/2d4afk/in_your_opinion_what_was_the_worst_year_for_music/). There are a few ways to consider this topic. &#x200B; **Absence of Star Power** One of the big issues for 1988 is that many big ticket artists  were midway through or finishing their album cycles. If we look at [songs that hit #1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_number_ones_of_1988), what we find is a lot of songs released the previous year topping out (George Michael, Michael Jackson, Guns N' Roses, INXS, Terence Trent D'Arby, etc.). Simply put,  one reason 1988 is so terrible is an issue of timing. The previous year and the following year were better for the same reason. &#x200B; **Sophomore Slumps, Rock is Dead** The narrative about grunge being a vibrant artistic response to glossy glam metal is simplistic but if we wanted to tell that story, we would probably start by looking at rock music in 1988. There is something decidely disappointing about a great many of the most popular rock albums of this year. Bon Jovi's [New Jersey](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ltQfXDdZCbibEE_oqmLEJ1KaA5WuXxfpI) is a bad album in many ways and it was a colossal success. It was the follow up to their breakout hit, Slippery When Wet. The singles sound alternately [overcooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exbqmxvEKoo), [painfully derivative of past work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfI1QznxY5c), and [cloying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhnfcHSPrfw). The records sound humongous and vacuous. It has almost no redeeming value and there was no bigger rock record at the time. There is nothing inside these songs, they are airless. Other giant glam metal records of the year are probably better on some basic craftsmanship level, but they have other problems. Poison's [sophomore record](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kkmoQoU3wMP9ZGxntAaKwT51RpubiCXio) is decidedly low stakes and, while its fun, it's flaws are glaring. The riffs sound tired, the hooks sound like microwaved retreads of other bands, and, despite the effort to use all manner of gang vocals, harmonies, and reverb, it's obvious the lead singer can't sing. Van Halen's second outing with Sammy Hagar , [OU812](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m2jXKtJSWzLhu_mt5mwodZBPpsphd5j_s), is better than both of the preiously discussed records, and essentially is a further progression of Van Halen's retreat to adult contemporary music. Much like the other two previously discussed records, the hooks don't shine as bright Van Hagar's debut. This band is on cruise control, dolling synth coated midtempo sub-""[Jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwYN7mTi6HM)"" romps like ""[When Its Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uhMCzTvV9Y)"". The whole affair sounds competent but dull, which is better than incompetent and dull I guess... There's a whole slew of these [B-list glam records](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x582onabzLc&list=OLAK5uy_nyXz9IFp2tO3Ekp8v-qIvA9bKX0uhxgK0) gumming up the headbanger's ball. The dye has been cast. Write a power ballad for the top 40, film a fake live video, watch the money roll in. If we look outside of the glam metal vortex, we find perfectly good [thrash](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kwDDSWKgSgMcCmR7XGOZ7KTyxK-XJO-fo) and [New Wave of British Heavy Metal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m0I0FaRPAN8n3Oe4e0TvaT-B04YFrdhSs), but the thrust of popular rock music was one giant ebb. &#x200B; &#x200B; **Synth Pop, Gated Reverb Hell** ""[Please Don't Go Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsVkhtiofPI)""... Rick Astley's blockbuster [Hold Me in Your Arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqZS89jFCFg) album... Paula Abdul's ""[Forever Your Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pyxKqdtrH8)""... Every year has records like these. So what makes this year's pop records seem so notably awful? This music is so forgettable, so aggressively banal, that it reaches some strange pinnacle of ugliness. A song like Kylie Minogue's ""[It's No Secret](https://youtu.be/RN-RoBVBefY?list=OLAK5uy_kLWIo75dE0ayvEBZ5tVF-87Q8G8Bw4I4s&t=58)"" almost hurts to listen to because the hookier it gets, the worse it feels. I don't want to remember any of it and yet its rinky-dink synth parts stick like a glue trap to mouse.  Maybe this is as bad as top-40 dreck ever got. Tinny drum machines, soft pads keyboards, cornball lyrics... Its wallpaper music taken to some new extreme. Its beige. It's the most beige music ever made. Bobby McFerrin's ""[Don't Worry Be Happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU)"" was smash in 1988 and it speaks to what role music can or should play. Music an be a catalyst for change and artists can push the boundaries, challenge social mores,  and change our common cultural conversation. One song could change your life. You could hear a record and change what you believe and how you behave. Maybe music can change the world. Or, alternatively, it can be a narcotic. It can tell us what we want to hear. Maybe that's what this song is and why people wanted hear it. Yuppies need lifestyle music too. Its not that there weren't any good pop records in 1988. Bobbie Brown made his [best record](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_naLcFtBcfEdozwt7_4rrhpEwPqWybyqTI). But, the overall thrust of pop music in 1988 is not just disappointing, it's dispiriting. &#x200B; **The Past Eats Itself** There often comes a point in an legacy artist's oeuvre where they look back, reflect on past work. At its best, this can be a satisfying return too one's roots, and consolidation of strengths, a reminder to an audience of what made an artist great in the first place. There has never been another supergroup like Traveling Wilburys. Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, George Harrison, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynn in one group is essentially a Mount Rushmore folk guitar pop. This group has talent to burn. Its incredible that this group formed and made music and, while the album, [Vol.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o4s1KVJaVA&list=OLAK5uy_m-mNOXTKXedS7rFT3L3RQFeFwNQWFU1aM), sounds fine, its pastiche.  Jeff Lynn and Petty borrowed heavily from the greats of the 1960's at the beginning of their careers and now they stand side by side with the artists they borrowed from. There's something strange about that combination, a snake eating its tail element, but the record is undeniably pleasant and reminds you of some of the artistic peaks  that the constitute members reached long before this record was made. If you want to hear George Harrison sounding like a Beatle from 1965, that version of George Harrison is here. Its nostalgia squared. The Wilburys weren't the only ones looking back. Keith Richard's [Talk is Cheap](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kAnNLaBcCb6r_xDRBB_7rbDxHPxZ48xZM) record mines his past glories and record collection in similar manner and U2's [Rattle and Hum](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nMOQB63qIjMXZDOkyylI3qcDCe-DUAGa8) is a tribute to old Blues and Sun Records aesthetics. At any given time, there is always some contingent of popular music fans who are rediscovering and breathing new life into some older form of music. That is not happen on any of these records. This is just a retreading of ground already covered, the 3rd generation photocopy. Some of the magic might still be in there, but the source material is better than the knockoff. &#x200B; **MCMLXXXVIII** This discussion notably overlooks the release of the great music listed below. I'm not sure how you would write a vicious takedown of the alternative rock or the rap of the year. Both sphere's seem like relative bright spots in an otherwise dismal landscape. [NWA - Straight Out of Compton](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kpnXtWauesEgVIWmv9So8swX3K1p54kkk) [Talk Talk - Spirit of Eden](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kJo40Y3lTzwowB4howqb-4wdC3GF8TkDY) [Public Enemy - It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UexhiKFCAAM&list=PLrbFUdbfepXVRWF74wd31t8IhBLHJJ4CJ) [Pixies - Surfer Rosa](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_krAnRWVn0GvDqhcmvGDRB6WncHzaKgZ3c) &#x200B; &#x200B;","Surfer Rosa and Daydream Nation alone make it pretty notable for rock though. It Takes a Nation of Millions... as well for hip hop (probably more that I've just not got around to yet) , as well as some smaller cool albums like Living Colour's Vivid and some Russian releases definitely stop it from being my least fav.",262
jqdgsp,"Hi all, I have been listening to a lot of 80s and 90s indie for the last year or so and was wondering what the current music scenes and trends are, and how to keep in the loop of them. For example a couple of years back there was a strong shoegaze resurgence in some indie circles that resulted in bands like Nothing becoming decently popular, or the surf punk lo fi scene that resulted in bands like FIDLAR and Wavves. My question now is what scenes and trends are there? I know about current psych rock bands such as King Gizzard and Thee Oh Sees and also the current wave of hyper electro pop artists such as 100gecs but not many other current scenes in music that I know of. How do you guys stay in the loop of these trends and are there any emerging and current exciting ones that I should be aware of? Thanks.","Just don‚Äôt. The independent music ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù is quite pulverized right now, there is not one major trend, so there‚Äôs no need to keep into any loop at all, just follow your taste and interests.

But fuck it, I love this album. Its genius, as John Cale has pointed out, is in its minilism. Whilst the 1967 Beatles and Beach Boys were breaking new ground by utilising huge orchestrations, the Velvets (and Hendrix) were proving you didn't need all that. All you needed was some innovation and some genius. Viola abuse on ""Venus in Furs"" and ""Black Angel's Death Song"", sure, but don't forget great touches like the celesta on ""Sunday Morning"" and intimate guitar tonality on ""Femme Fatale"" and ""I'll Be Your Mirror"". And then there's Lou Reed's songwriting-- Bob Dylan gone terse; Chuck Berry gone dangerous. He managed to be arty without sounding like an ""artist"": at heart, he was a rock and roller, and the music connects because he places it in a believably human context. The context, of course, being NYC in its rioutess summers: VU&N positively smacks of oppressive inner-city heat, and burns with the wild energy of youth, sex, drugs and hangovers. As intense of an experience as you'll find in the rock canon.",151
jsvyft,"As many of you might already know, System of a Down released two songs about a week ago- their first content in about 15 years. They put discrepancies aside and came together to bring awareness to the resurfaced Nagorno-Karabakh War in their home-region, on the border of Artsakh and Azerbaijan. You can look up the conflict yourself and come to your own conclusions and determinations, but the point of this post is to discuss activism in music. Artists are generally known for being idealistic, for having grand ideals for this world we all call home. But some artists take it further. SOAD is one of those who take things further. Their music has always been political, and these songs they just released are no different- meant to bring awareness to the plight of their nation. All proceeds from the music and merch surrounding it are going to a fund set up for soldiers of their side (I believe originally for first aid kits, but probably more than that by now). Personally, I love when artists get active in politics. It‚Äôs good to see that they care about more than just making money or art for art‚Äôs sake. It also exudes passion and makes for good art/music. I love music itself, but IMO, our capacity to care about more than ourselves is what makes us human. On the other hand, sharing art that speaks to the soul- and not just to the politics of our minds and world- is definitely also a way of caring for more than ourselves. Anyways, I always get so into the issues that artists bring up because artists are passionate people and really convey their concern well. It really sucks me in. I‚Äôve been researching the conflict at hand ever since the songs came out. What about you? Have you heard of the conflict, or the new SOAD music? What other artists do you appreciate for their activism? Do you even care about politics? If not, why not? I would prefer this post doesn‚Äôt turn into a divisive political argument. Rather than taking sides or defending specific positions, I would love to have discussion on activism itself, and how it comes through when put out via art, specifically music. But take it away Redditers.","I love it when an artist takes a stance on an issue. In fact if the lyrics don't at least make some sort of social commentary, then I may few those lyrics with indifference. Some folks, including artists that I like (*cough* King Buzzo *cough*), believe that politics have no place in music or art in general, but if that's the case, when are people supposed to hear new political ideas? Are people just expected to comb the political sections of their local bookstores? Some folks aren't exposed to politics at all unless it's through music, movies, or art.   I haven't heard the new SOAD songs yet but I've appreciated their stuff in the past. Some bands that I've listened to a little more who have a lot of political songs include: Minor Threat, Fugazi, Bad Brains, the Clash, Jello Biafra/Dead Kennedys, Joan Baez, and of course Rage Against the Machine.   I think that a lot of artists only have a handful of political songs because they don't want to be pigeonholed as a political band/artist. I can think of political songs by Steve Earle and AJJ but I wouldn't label them as political bands. Even irreverent Primus has a few songs that take a political stance. Conversely, punk is know for being very political but I can think of punk bands that aren't exactly very political, such as Black Flag and Big Black, though you can pretty much tell how they lean.",47
ju7u03,"Could you imagine a world without The Beastie Boys' 'Paul's Boutique'? 'The purpose of copyright law is to promote the progress of arts (and sciences) by protecting the exclusive right of authors and inventors to benefit from their works of authorship.' The idea is that more people will be spurred into creating their own original works by denying them the ability to profit off previous innovations. This seems sound in theory; but is it true? All new genres are formed by various people innovating and expanding on the most recently created genre. Recently, almost all new musical genres and movements have been sample-based, including hip hop and various forms of electronic music. All signs point to any new potential genres being heavily sample-based. As a result, I feel like we may have reached a point where the purpose of copyright is no longer being served by its application! In other words, the relatively recent expansion of copyright law is so strict that it is no longer promoting the progress of the arts. There has to be a balance between the right of authorship and the right to innovate. Currently, the potential for innovation is heavily stifled by an overriding application of copyright. Those who wish to create are hampered by the massive fees one usually requires to clear a sample. Paul's Boutique - The Beastie Boys is just one example of an album that couldn't be made today with the current legislation that has developed! Is copyright's purpose being upended by its application? I'd love to hear some thoughts, especially from a legal basis; I'm writing a dissertation along these lines.",What would be better would be if sampling and interpolation were governed by the same clarity as [cover songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_license); you can freely do them as long as you pay a modest amount of royalties (set by Congress or the music industry) to the person you're sampling.,98
jui4ek,"Hi, I‚Äôm ~~Troy McClure~~ /u/FreeLook93! You may remember me from such posts as ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Talk: The Who before Tommy‚Äù and the dozens comments I make stating my dislike for Led Zeppelin! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all noticed that at least once a week someone feels the need to make a post asking ‚ÄúWhy does modern music suck so bad?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt music as good as it was in the old days?‚Äù. I sure have.     So let me be upfront with my view on this as well as my own biases (at least the relevant ones to this discussion). I disagree. I do not believe music has gotten worse over the years and a majority of the music I listen to is rock music. So if a lot of what I write here is too rock music focused (it will be), that is why. So I plan on making this post as a kind of ‚Äúreply all‚Äù to the ‚Äúle wrong generation-ers‚Äù of this community. While there are many who make posts firmly stating their opinion that modern music is not as good, I suspect that many others might sympathize with this view point, so I thought I would make this to help address that.      I will be writing from here on out talking to these people directly. You could say this is just me yelling at strawman, but I‚Äôve seen all of these arguments used time and time again.   Now I could just list all of the artists from the past 20 years that I think are great, but I don‚Äôt think that would be very helpful, or fun to do, so I‚Äôm going to try something else. Let‚Äôs look at why you think music from the past was better than the music of today.   First, and this may seem obvious, you are more familiar with it. This works in two was. The first being that the more familiar you are with a style of music, the more you are going to relate to it. If all you listen to is classic rock, that‚Äôs going to be the music you relate to. If you lack the familiarity with, let‚Äôs say Hip-Hop, you are going to have a much harder time relating to it. I‚Äôm not going to go into this too much, but it‚Äôs worth keeping in mind. The second way this tricks you is in how it affects the two samples you are comparing. Let‚Äôs stick with just rock music. Now if you believe that rock was so much better back in the ‚Äò60s and ‚Äò70s, that‚Äôs what you will listen to. Your collection of rock albums from those years will grow and grow, while your collection of rock albums from recent years will stay barren.  If you were to list all albums you‚Äôve heard that were released between 1967 and 1971, it would likely be pretty long. But what about between 2015 and 2019? Would the list be as long? Could you even name five albums you‚Äôve listened to? How about just 1? You‚Äôve got way more samples from one category, you really need to balance those out if you want to make a fair comparison. Speaking of skewed sample sizes:     Second, you need to think about the years you are comparing here. If I were to say ‚ÄúMusic from the ‚Äò50s-‚Äô90s was way better than it is today‚Äù, do you see anything wrong with that? You are trying to compare 5 decades of music to just two. Of course there is going to be more good music produced over 5 decades than there is over two decades, they have 30 extra years!     Third, and this is a massive one, survivorship bias. If you are going back and listening to music from the ‚Äò60s or ‚Äò70s, for example, that music has been curated for you by time. The cream rises and the skum sinks. When music from previous decades is being shared, it is overwhelming the good stuff. Albums that may not have been popular upon release will gain a following over time. Music that was popular upon release may become all but forgotten with the passage of time. *The Velvet Underground & Nico* is now widely considered to be one of the greatest records of the 1960s, but it was fairly unknown back in the 1960s. 1969 saw the release of several amazing albums, but the top charting single in the US that year was [Sugar Sugar](https://youtu.be/h9nE2spOw_o) by The Archies. Every era produces fantastic music, every era produces not so fantastic music. By listening to music from the past you are going to get  much better music on average than compared to what you would get by just listening to the radio today. Classic rock radio stations play generally the best songs, the ones that have stood the test of time, from a span of like 40 years. Pop radio stations play the top 40 hits of the past year or so generally.    So put that all together and what do you get and then look at our comparison again. The group of old music spans a larger time, has more samples to draw from for each year, and all the samples have been put through rigorous testing. By comparison the modern sample covers fewer years, you have less to draw from for each year, and there have been fewer filters on each sample. And to add on top of that you‚Äôve been conditioned to like the first group more because you‚Äôve grown up with it and listened to it more. That is a hilariously flawed comparison to be making. The problem here isn‚Äôt with modern music, it‚Äôs with your understanding of it.        There are many other arguments that get thrown around, so let‚Äôs do some quick fire answers right now.    **‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt even play real instruments today‚Äù** - Some people don‚Äôt, some people do. I personally don‚Äôt think it really matters, but if you do think it matters keep in mind that none of those classical composers played the instruments in their performances. Mozart might have been a great composer, but did he have the lungs to play a tuba? (that‚Äôs not a rhetorical question, I really don‚Äôt know).      **They don‚Äôt even write their own music any more!‚Äù** - Again some do, some don‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt really think it matters that much. However, if you are going to stick with this as a reason you don‚Äôt like modern music you better not bring up the likes of Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, or Led Zeppelin as an example as to why old music is better.       **‚ÄùNo one makes music like X anymore‚Äù** - How would you know if you don‚Äôt listen to any modern music? The music being produced today is more varied than at any point in history, whatever you are looking for you can probably find if you know where to look.      The next thing worth noting is the  western music bias. Odds are that you pretty much just listen to music from the western world, and even more specifically from the UK, US, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia. That's' less than a half billion people. That leaves over 7 billion people. If all you listened to was Japanese rock music you might swear that the last 20 years have been a golden age for music. My point here is that your scope is limited, just like everyone else. This really just feeds into how little modern music you are likely aware of when making your comparison, but also how little old music. Maybe just as much great music is being produced as ever (or more), but it‚Äôs just happening elsewhere.   Here‚Äôs the bottom line: It‚Äôs easy to now, decades removed, look back and see only the gems. They shine in the light. But when you are in the thick of it, there is a lot of shit to wade through between gems. Don‚Äôt go comparing a cup of gems to a cup of dirt from your back garden. Modern music doesn't suck, your samples do.      I know I‚Äôve left a lot out , and a lot of that was, how you say, inelegant. So I am sure others will be able to add on to this, or at the very least point out where I‚Äôve gone wrong. The internet is very good at pointing out when you get something wrong.","Survivorship bias is the best argument against the narrative that music today is worse, imo. There's a radio station in my country that sometimes plays charts from other years, and once they did 1991. The top 5 Billboard singles consisted of Bryan Adams, Color Me Badd, Paula Abdul, Timmy T and those ""EVERYBODY dance now"" guys. Winds Of Change, now considered an amazing intemporal song, came in at 30, behind Mark fucking Wahlberg. Albums released in 1991 include Nevermind, Metallica's Black Album and Pearl Jam's Ten, among others. So yeah, survivorship bias is a big thing. Pop music has mostly been forgettable for a long time, but the good stuff endures. More recent albums will surely fall the same pattern",78
jvbf32,"I‚Äôm blown away by the impact of punk rock, as well as how it changed music forever. Punk rock brought rock music to its basics, and it presented a stripped down, raw, direct form of rock that emphasized brutish sounds and quick tempos. Punk showed that virtuosity wasn‚Äôt necessary if you wanted to make music. Punk made it possible to be a musician, if you knew a couple of chords & basic stuff. Punk was an exciting movement that created a new era in music history.  Also, the Ramones could be one of the most important bands of all time! The Ramones‚Äô impact on punk is *massive*; they pioneered the genre, and what they did set a strong template for punk rock in general. The Ramones have inspired so many musicians, and their first album is a milestone for music. The Clash & the Sex Pistols are influential, too.  Punk rock literally spawned/influenced multiple genres & sub-genres. It led to hardcore punk, skate punk, pop punk, thrash metal & black metal, and punk rock influenced grunge and alternative rock, too. Post-hardcore & emo came from bands that experimented with/expanded hardcore‚Äôs template, and metalcore and mathcore combined metal & hardcore.  Post-punk came from punk as well, and the Cure, Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, Wire, Gang of Four, Pere Ubu, etc. took punk‚Äôs template into completely different territories. No wave was inspired by punk, too, and punk rock started a revolution that changed music. Punk‚Äôs influence can be found in surprising places, too; Voivod was heavily influenced by hardcore punk, and the Ramones had a huge impact on Kevin Shields. Godspeed You! Black Emperor have ties to punk rock, too; Efrim Menuck and David Bryant have talked about the influence that punk had on them, and as far as conducting a band, 80s hardcore did inspire GY!BE in that sense.","Punk took rock music away from a rock music elite that had quickly become bougie and overeducated. It brought rock back from the stadiums and televised late night performances and into the pubs again. It took rock from something you needed a studio and 10 years of instrument experience to play, and said ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a guitar, now *fuck off and play.*‚Äù The most common criticism of punk rock is its most important characteristic - anyone can play it.  Due to its simplicity it‚Äôs also very easily tweaked and modded for innovation. When vanilla punk rock inevitably became co-opted by upper middle class-bound art students, hardcore brought it back down to grime. When even that became swept up in trends and started to lose its meaning due to an unending sense of nihilism and despair, the New York and Boston-style tough guy hardcore brought it back to something more familial, and even spiritual. Crust/anarchopunk upped the ante on that nihilism and even brought in some more experimental elements, d-beat upped the harshness, pop punk found immense mainstream success (though we don‚Äôt talk about that in this pub), and the indie kids of the 2000‚Äôs found ways to draw influences from most of these.  Punk is extremely important and all too often dismissed for its simplicity, current lack of mainstream airplay, the harshness of some genres, and perceived ephemerality among ‚Äúserious‚Äù musicians (re: blowhards), but it‚Äôll always be there in terms of influence and cultural impact.",126
jw7abb,"Came across this some time last year, and just found this subreddit, so thought I'd share. Way back in the 70's, after a big war, Zambia was trying to build itself back up. With the influences of bands like The Rolling Stones and The Jimi Hendrix Experience coming their way, it started a whole generation of Zambians interested in fuzz/acid rock.  &#x200B; One of the premier bands was WITCH, which stands for ""We Intend To Cause Havoc."" &#x200B; While a lot of the other Zamrock is hit or miss, below I've linked to a couple of other bands. But WITCH is definitely THE Zamrock band. Anyone familiar with them, or have any other suggestions? Would love to see some of these songs get put into a film or show. I'm sure if Apatow or Rogen got their hands on the rights, they'd play some of these! &#x200B; [WITCH - Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMHlkvJbWos) &#x200B; [Blackfoot - Running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCzKuqGTOeU&list=OLAK5uy_mtwS4LmjqXDWMr_tr3nNk5B54O5z2sbHQ&index=4) &#x200B; [Salty Dog - Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAlPRudKEsc&list=PLsuxooOti4f_5niHyR3Dwv2CBn93tDZKW&index=2)","Won't be adding much for discussion, but I love when Zamrock gets recognition.   Had a brief friendship with a girl from Zambia and the topic of music was brought up one day and she was beyond excited when I told her about a recent Zamrock documentary I saw. I sense theres immense pride behind it, not only being a small country that often feels overshadowed by other East African nations, but also the fact that directly after their independence, the President (PM? Leader?) had radios all over the country play music from these bands.   The downfall of the scene is incredibly sad, but their legacy keeps on!",47
jx2tbk,"I saw a similar question on general insider secrets and one person mentioned how when it looks like an artist is exploding on soundcloud etc, it is actually the label doing that behind the scenes. Or how Paramore was made to look like it was signed to an indie label when it fact was a major label. Or that apparently many rapper's 'beefs' are just orchestrated. I was wondering about other music industry secrets? Things you might know as an industry insider or learnt through sessions with insiders etc? I dont mean conspiracy theories or anything like that. More just general things about the music industry that outsiders dont know and we think are more 'organic' than is the case?","The band ""Bullet For My Valentine"" were signed to Sony BMG in 2004 but released their first EP and Album via ""Visible Noise"", an indie label to give off the illusion that they were ""coming up"" or ""growing"" naturally. When in reality their deal with Sony was worth $25,000,000. The reason they got such a huge deal was because the A&R guy that signed them bet Simon Cowell that he could make a metal band blow up in the same way Simon Cowell made ""El Divo"" blow up from nothing around the same time. It sounds absolutely bonkers but I assure you it's true. I know some people that have worked with BFMV and its well known in certain inner circles.",250
jz1nwk,"Especially if I've been spending time listening to more artistic/avant garde music, something more ""generic"" sounding can actually be a breath of fresh air. I love binging bands like Ween, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, ext. But I can get just as much enjoyment from binging bands like Breaking Benjamin, Bush, hell even Nickelback has their odd charms. I suppose it's about needing balance. I don't want everything I hear to be super cutting edge, and vise versa. I think this also explains why most of my favorite artists are somewhere in between experimental and accessible (like Gorillaz or Tame Impala). Perhaps this post is a little basic, but I just felt like sharing. Thoughts?","There's a lot of middle ground between avant garde and generic. Generic in this case generally mean the artists doesn't do anything that another better band does. Not even in terms of the better band being Avant Garde or groundbreaking band, just one with better songwriters that aren't trying to totally ape one single artists (or a couple other like-minded artists). I mean, I'll go so far as to say I don't mind Bush, mostly when I was young, but looking back on them, man did Gavin really want to be Kurt Cobain to a comical degree.  Though even a lot of the artists cited are pretty firmly middle-brow at their most experimental.  I've never got Tame Impala as being anything especially groundbreaking even for their niche. There's more overt throwbacks in the Psych Revival, but Psych Revival is still a revival of trodden ground.",113
jzh9p3,"I stumbled across this wonderful band by the name of Magma about a week ago. I came in thinking it wouldn't be for me, but I think this is some of the best stuff I've heard! I listened to a studio album, and thought it sounded cool, but I was too busy practicing to have my full attention then. I got a [live version of two of their songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo0FxtTceTI) in my recommended, so I decided to listen to it seeing I wasn't doing much today, and I was absolutely blown away. Drummer and vocalist Christian Vander crafted his own language called Kobaian (based in German and Slavic languages), to make all listeners from any ethnicity focus more on the vocals as an instrument than as a literary device; this also makes it feel very exotic, mixed in with how many influences and different genres are fused into one! Someone here has definitely heard of them as the live video has over five hundred thousand views, so I wanted to spark a discussion on this band the moment I heard them. All of the musicians here have major talent, with how well they play their instruments, the control the have, and the pure emotion here is something else that I just adore!  I find it insane that this band single-handedly formed their own unique genre that is now influencing many artists in the progressive rock scene, including Caravan, Opeth and Porcupine Tree. bands that emulated Magma exploded in France during the 70's, and their influence and musicality lives on until this day! It must be noted that there is a renaissance going on with Japanese rock bands taking inspiration from Magma! Hope you all absolutely love this stellar band! I linked the live version around the top if you missed it :D","Not only did Vander invent the language, all of the albums together are essentially a giant space opera about the colonization of the planet Kobaia by refugees from a dying Earth, and later the conflicts between those settlers and later waves of Earth refugees. Magma is great, but you've definitely gotta be in the right mood for it.",36
k0dcxp,"So, not sure if you‚Äôre all aware, but the Grammy nominations were announced today. One of the biggest surprises was the fact that ‚ÄúYummy‚Äù by Justin Bieber got a nod for Song of the Year. If you‚Äôve heard the song, you know what an embarrassing piece of nearly unlistenable trash it is. It legitimately could pass as a parody song made by someone like The Lonely Island or Nick Kroll to make fun of artists like Beiber. Meanwhile, The Weeknd, who enjoyed widespread critical acclaim for After Hours (and especially the hit song ‚ÄúBlinding Lights‚Äù), was completely shut out of all the categories. Pretty much every single music-informed person is absolutely baffled as to how this occurred.  Anyway, I don‚Äôt see how the Grammy‚Äôs can possibly defend this decision. They had almost no credibility before this and now, well that‚Äôs pretty much the last of it down the drain. Edit: got the category wrong. It was Performance of the Year apparently.","The Grammy's still had credibility? I was unaware that they'd nominated *Yummy* for song of the year, but it really doesn't change my view on the Grammy's.

It's no secret that people like Beyonce, Whitney Houston, Ariana Grande, Mariah Carey, John Legend, Celine Dion, and many more are excellent singers. However, there are many other singers who realistically aren't that good, they can sound off key or out of tune, but for the music they make it sounds good. For example, Courtney Love is not considered a great singer to a lot of people, but for the music that she made with Hole, her voice worked because it wasn't perfect.

k22kt9,"Hey, guys. Post-punk is an amazing genre, and it‚Äôs my favorite type of music. I like/love a lot of classic post-punk, and I‚Äôve noticed that post-punk can be *very* experimental/progressive in its own way. Progressive rock can be very complex, too, but I wonder if post-punk equaled/potentially surpassed prog in reference to the complexity.  To be fair, prog did push the boundaries of rock. Prog favors long songs, skilled instrumentation and an emphasis on technicality. Prog has elements of folk, jazz and classical, and prog can have avant-garde bits, too. Yes, King Crimson, Genesis and Camel demonstrated how complexity could advance rock, and prog attempted to increase rock‚Äôs musical vocabulary. Gamelan influenced King Crimson, and Pink Floyd has psychedelic, atmospheric sounds.  However, post-punk turned into something that was completely different in comparison to punk. Post-punk emphasizes experimentation, and it took punk‚Äôs ethics into territories that were unexpected and bizarre. Some of the Birthday Party‚Äôs stuff veered into free jazz, and they had elements of the blues & noise rock. Pere Ubu did stuff that was *weird*, since they had innovative (and abrasive) synths, jazzy bits and dissonant, surreal sounds. Joy Division‚Äôs dark, cold and austere sound had melancholic elements, and Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure & Bauhaus pioneered gothic rock. Echo & the Bunnymen have neo-psychedelic elements, too.  Post-punk has clear influences from funk, and it was inspired by reggae and dub, too. Free jazz could be found in the more ‚Äúout there‚Äù representations of post-punk, and Krautrock definitely influenced stuff such as Public Image Ltd & Wire. Gang of Four‚Äôs Entertainment! is very danceable, too, and post-punk can have psychedelia & electronic, as well.  I get that prog has a thing for intricate, detailed arrangements in the context of rock, but post-punk is such an innovative genre that took cues from so many styles, and post-punk led to another wave of experimentation in rock.","It's *progressive* but not in the same meaning of the word as prog rock is. Prog is used mostly as a genre term. A lot of modern prog you see today isn't actually that progressive in the way you put it, but rather reminiscent of the sort of style you'd see from the old days. Nothing really starts out as a genre. Prog rock was called so because it pushed boundaries and was experimental, but after a while you could sort of pin down some of recurring elements of it and you get a retrospective appreciation of it. So these recurring elements became integral to a style of music making, regardless of how wildly different it would be even within the genre (Gentle Giant, Yes, Rush, Frank Zappa can all be called prog, but are wildly different on a whole). I don't think prog as a genre has much to do with actual experimentation anymore (though there can of course still be, and often is). At this point you can sort of map the influences to find out whether it's rooted in classic prog (eg. Rush > Dream Theater or King Crimson > Tool), and to some point make a checklist of whether it follows these signature recurring elements. It's kind of arbitrary, as with any genre definition, but I think this is what separates Post-punk from the prog label. It's not about whether it's actually progressive, but just whether or not it fits the genre label.",119
k2ia4t,"So recently with MGK's new album and his relationship with Megan Foxx, the man has been in the music news a lot recently. He performed at the AMA's and it seems like his relationship with Foxx has now pushed him into the mainstream pop culture nexus.  With this added attention, I'm here to say that no artist in the 2010's is more derivative and uninspired than MGK.  With the beginning of his career (Black Flag, Lace Up) there was a clear focus on trying to be the hardest rapper. Trap and hip hop beats with boastful lyrics of ""look at me, look where I've been, I've been through the shit, I know I'm hard"". There was hardly anything separating him from every other wannabe Mac Miller.  MGK signed with BAD BOY and continued to push out albums from 2013 to 2019, with them mostly being your standard rap fair. During this time he also started a feud with Eminem. This probably what he was most known for during this time, as the man was straight embarrassed by Em. This proved that honestly he wasn't a good rapper and was just corny for trying so hard.  Fast forward to 2019 and Mr. Kelly seems to have undergone a complete transformation. His whole persona has changed from ""Call me Steve-O, Im a wild boy"" to "" OMG I'm so sad at everything, I wish I could be like Lil Peep."" Seriously, the man has tried to become a total emo wannabe.  He went from being a Slim Jesus clone, to a Lil Peep try hard, and if anything in 2020 comes off as disgusting its MGK trying to postulate like he's this hurt artist, when for a decade he's been trying to tell us just how hard he is. That not to say there's anything wrong with being sensitive as an artist, or to even show growth in your music, but to be one way for your entire career, and then to switch up only after there's been a successful movement in music (emo rap/soundcloud rap) just strikes me as disingenuous and like he's just trying to capitalize on something.  I realize that many people find his most recent album to be fresh and different from him, but I honestly can't feel like he's being authentic at all. If anything, it feels like Kiss and Disco, Garth Brooks trying to be Chris Gaines. It just doesn't work.","Man it‚Äôs totally fine to hate MGK, and your reasons for disliking him are totally valid, but there are plenty of artists who are just as unoriginal if not more. Most artists follow trends, especially in rap. I don‚Äôt like his music either but dang bro he‚Äôs just tryna make money lol",451
k2t4cz,"Recently I‚Äôve gone through my playlists playing some of the older songs on there, and I realized the music didn‚Äôt have the same sound and kick to it.   I played a few newer songs and it felt somewhat the same. It sounded powerful and emotional like it always had, but much less so. It sounded like... nothing? It just felt like background noise, to the point where I would subconsciously just block it out and only hear a few words or sounds. It somewhat hurts actually.. these were, and still are some of my favorite songs, but I don‚Äôt feel the same as I did when I first heard them. Is this some kind of condition or is this normal? If you could respond with some kind of answer to this, it would be very much appreciated.

k3bo6b," You know the saying along the lines of ""you can't help what you like""? Basically meaning that you aren't really choosing what music/food/whatever you like better or worse than others, its just whatever your body responds positively or negatively to. It goes deeper than that though. If you're a passionate music listener like me, maybe you might WANT to like certain music that you don't like at the time being. I wanted to get into stoner metal for whatever reason, but I didn't actually enjoy it completely yet. I liked grunge, so I listened to a lot of grunge, then went into stoner rock/heavy psych, then finally stoner/doom metal. My question is, do you enjoy listening to music that immediately sounds pleasing to your ears, or (in my case) like the music much better when you had to ""work"" for it per se? I remember listening to a doom metal song a few times and only thought it was decent, but then the fifth or sixth time it clicked for me and now I love it. In my experience, pop and other accessible music that's designed to sound catchy and pleasing from the very first listen, is also music that gets stale the quickest. I can enjoy a good pop song, but I don't really feel a connection with it. It was almost too easy to like. Maybe your self identity has a lot to do with this too. As someone who somewhat ties their music taste to their identity, I wanted to listen to stuff that fit with my persona. Just like how a big tough dude might want to take the metal or old school rap direction, or someone who's hipster wants to associate themselves with some indie shit. I want to listen to music that is ME. If nobody felt connections with music or wanted to get into things they weren't into at the time, nobody would listen to avant garde jazz and we would only bump Top 40 hits. Interested to see thoughts on this.","I've heard most peoples music taste stops changing after they turn about 30. So it could be an ageist approach but maybe the nostalgia for the relative simplicity of one's 20s just feels comfortable and safe and people stop looking for new sounds? I'm not quite there yet so personally I don't know how I'll feel in a few years but I'm fairly determined to keep checking in with what's new and exciting and I think with the internet that whole 30 yrs  theory might be defunct. There's something new out there for everyone now a days its just not always very easy to find.

I like their music (A Day In The Life and Across the Universe especially) but when people say it's the greatest of all time I just don't quite hear it myself. I love Britpop and I always see people comparing Oasis songs etc. to the Beatles (especially She's Electric, which is probably my favorite song ever). From what I've heard, I don't hear the similarities. To be fair I'm 20 so I definitely wasn't around while they were releasing music, but my dad is a lifelong fan of the Rolling Stones fan and never was as into them. I don't have his musical tastes exactly, but I've also become a casual Stones fan after growing up hearing them and personally also think they're a lot better than The Beatles. The thing is that another part of me sees them as the greatest band of all time and I'm convinced I just can't hear it. Anyone have any suggestions that someone somewhat familiar with their discography should hear to further appreciate them? I have listened to Abbey Road fully and it was good but didn't blown me away.","It‚Äôs hard to recommend where to start on the Beatles because they changed so much across 12 albums and 7 years.  The red and blue albums walk you through their entire career from 63-70 which a nice mix of hits and deeper cuts. The 1 album has all their non album number one singles.  If you want to start with an album, I‚Äôd go Rubber soul. Not too experimental and still has plenty of that classic beatlemania charm. Some of their best work is on this album. Norwegian Wood, drive my car, girl, Michelle, the word, in my life.  If you want more old school, straight up Brit-pop I‚Äôd watch the movie Hard Days Night. It‚Äôs a comedy movie to accompany the album and is full of energy and dry-as-hell 60‚Äôs British sarcasm. Great pop tracks and a great fun movie. If you like these in particular listen to their previous two albums also, which are soaked in Brit-pop fun.  Post 1965 they got more experimental. For slightly edgier, psychedelic rock go with Revolver (probably my favorite of theirs). This album oozes flower pop/hippie-psychedelic-summer-of-1966 energy. Plus it has Tomorrow Never Knows, Eleanor Rigby, and 3 whole George tracks.  Abbey road is another classic. Sleeker, heavier production more akin to the upcoming 70‚Äôs. Has everything from the pop hit Here Comes The Sun to the 8 minute, sludgy, dark, heavy doom rock track ‚ÄúI Want You‚Äù. Plus the second half of the album all flows together in a seamless and intricate medley that‚Äôs equal parts fun and beautiful.  The white album is a double album that came at a time when the Beatles creative unity was fracturing, so it was more a collage of songs written by each of the Beatles rather than the Beatles making Beatles songs. This album is more popular with established fans as its a bit experimental, weird and directionless as far as Beatles albums go. But it‚Äôs full of absolutely smashing tracks like Dear Prudence, Blackbird, Helter Skelter, Long Long Long, Back in The USSR, and about 25 others.",450

Outside of various folk traditions (most of which got a rock'n'roll treatment in 60's anyway), only a few really distinct styles exist, in any country. In Russia, I would say that local ""bards"" were unique enough to deserve a mention. Bards were what is now called singer-songwriters living and working in Soviet Union. They were never ""mainstream"" while USSR existed, in that they almost never could make a career out of their music and had very little official recordings, unless one happened to find a place for his songs in a movie, but they were extremely popular nevertheless. Musically, they were influenced by pre-Revolution tradition of [Romances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_\(music\)), but also by much simpler folk songs and prison songs. But the real distinction of bardic music lies in lyrics and in themes. If you ask anyone in Russia to define this genre, its defining characteristics would be six-string guitar and songs about tourism. Yes, you've read this right. While not all bards sang about mountaineering, boating or camping, songs about such experiences were extremely common, and become associated with the genre as much as trucks and beer are associated with modern country music. The reason behind this was a huge boom in non-organized tourism, which started a decade after the Second World War, when country recovered enough, and people finally had free time on their hands. Official, organized tourism could only offer trips to overcrowded resorts to a limited number of citizen, and the rest were left to entertain themselves, which they did. And so bards sang of campfires, of dangerous mountain passes, of meeting new friends and of partings. I'm not sure if any other country had anything like those songs. Well, maybe American trail songs come close, but they went out of vogue before Soviet bardic music was born, and frankly, were more about movie cowboys than the real ones. Bards, on the other hand, were often avid mountaineers, boaters or campers themselves. However, in reality, bards were never limited to just one theme. Their songs ranged from love letters to their girlfriends to commentary on international politics. Many were satiric, making fun of pecularities of living in USSR, or of things common to all humanity. Since there almost never were performed officially, they had much more freedom in criticizing USSR, its leadership and handling of dissent, though of course some norms had to be observed, for author's safety. I started writing this post because I really wanted to talk about one of my favourite Bards, Vladimir Vysotsky, whose voice and music, I think, largely determined my musical tastes in my childhood (as his was pretty much the only non-children music heard in our house, my parents being tired of Russian rock and European pop available to a casual listener by the time I was born). But I realized that I wanted to showcase more than one bard, and also Vysotsky really needs a long, long separate post (I'm thinking about giving a rough translation to one of my favourite songs of his, but it's so full of references few people outside of USSR would understand it would require yet another long post just to explain it all so the song makes sense). So, let me just give you a few examples of what I was talking about above - without translations, but with some short explanation for each song. [""Solnyshko Lesnoye""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaQx4o8kmLM) - ""(My) Sunny of Forest"". THE bardic song. If you ask a Russian citizen to name one, you get this one. Covered by large number of other artists, this song by Yuri Vizbor tells about the sadness of parting from a woman the song's hero met on a trail. But now his trip is ending, and he must fly away. The refrain suggests they might meet again some time, but he doesn't know when or where. I love this song, though by now everyone's pretty tired of it, and it is considered somewhat cliche. [""Nochnaya Doroga""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnBZIaB5Ues) - ""Night Road"". This is the song I sing to myself every time I have to drive at night on some deserted road. Deeply philosophical, it make a parallel between the road and the life itself. ""A road has no ending, but it has a resolution: the roads are hard, but better than no roads"". It can be interpreted in many ways, from the general advice on life, to expectation of societal changes. [""My Vrashayem Zemlyu""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=857vy90Yb60) - ""We Turn The Earth"". Another popular theme with early bards was the Great Patriotic War (Russian part of World War 2, for those no so well-versed in our historic conventions). Few did it better than Vysotsky: his considerable acting talent and his rough voice gave his songs about war the feeling of authenticity which even drove some veterans to claim Vysotsky served in their unit (even though he was born too later to participate in the fighting). [""Oduvanchikov Dym""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I1JwlZQCMc) - ""Dandelion Smoke"". Ivaschenko and Vasil'ev duo (""Ivasi"") are bards from something like 3rd generation, starting in 80's. This song is a tale about a man who wants to go camping, to be in the woods, but never can find the time. It's a bit funny, but ends on a somewhat morbid note, as he notices himself getting older, and now only dreams about finishing all his business and dying peacefully (it's not as morbid in lyrics as it sounds in description, but it's really hard to get the nuance across the language barrier). [""Svadba #1""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tthDS15Mbw) - ""Wedding #1"". Leonid Sergeev invented what he called ""bard-opera"", and this is a prime example of this genre: he sings for the whole cast of a typical lower-class Russian wedding, from the calculating bride, to confused groom, to their mothers already trying to pin all sins on another's son or daughter, a choir of guests who are only here to drink, a bored official who registers the marriage and immediately supplies directions for a divorce, a drunk-out-his-mind witness and even groom's grandfather. And finally for this brief overview, here's a modern spoof of a bard song: [""Snezhinka""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkWoBs_OAso), ""A Snowflake"". The song starts as a generic ""I sit near the campfire and watch a snowflake drift over the flame"" stuff, then goes on into absurdity (""We don't change our habits away from our homes / In my rucksack I have pig fat and matches, and 8 tomes of Turgenev""), then makes a seeming detour into a romantic message for a far-away female friend, and then plunges into a furious diatribe against all city dwellers and city ways, including a jab at then-current mayor of Moscow and his grandiose 850th birthday of the city party and even the local favourite soccer team. Today, many modern Russian singer-songwriters seek to distance themselves from ""bard"" label, to avoid being pigeon-holed into ""weird bearded dudes in sweaters singing about campfires"" genre, and even feud to some degree with the remaining hardcore bard community. All I can say, the music has really been commercialized and it done it no good, so let's leave it at that.",This is super interesting! You should consider submitting an expanded version of this to *The Wire*  magazine as part of their primer series.,87
k8exu9,"I've huge rock/metal fan since my senior year of high-school in 2016, but I've only recently really gotten into more extreme types of metal like death metal (technical/melodic), black metal, doom metal, deathcore, etc. Lately, I've also been getting into a lot of nu metal bands (I know nu metal isn't close to extreme metal don't @ me) from the late-90s and early-2000s, with Korn, Linkin Park (RIP Chester Bennington), System of a Down, Deftones and Slipknot, as well as a few Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach singles. Even as a little kid I remember bands like Linkin Park and Evanescence being massively popular and played extensively on both rock and pop radio. When I was in high-school however, pretty much everyone in my grade didn't like any of these types of bands. A lot of them laughed at Limp Bizkit (for understandable reasons) and a lot of people considered Linkin Park cringey. It didn't help that songs like ""In the End"", ""One Step Closer"", ""Crawling"" and ""Numb"" became memed to death. My question is how/why did nu metal become so popular. Listening to it without knowing any context I would not peg it as a genre with any commercial potential. It seems too abrasive, yet bands like Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Korn, etc sold MILLIONS all around the world. Significant Other and Meteora are 7x Platinum and Hybrid Theory is 11x Platinum. Again, I was a teenager during the mid-to-late 2010s so my early memories of popular music were after nu metal fell out of the mainstream. Honestly, I truly do feel like the nu metal period was the last time a subgenre of rock/metal was a dominant force in both mainstream music and popular culture. I know pop punk, post-grunge, indie rock/garage rock and emo were also very popular in the mid-to-late 2000s with bands like MCR, Panic!, Fall Out Boy, etc but even those genres didn't dominant the discourse like nu metal did.","We didn't have the internet like it is now, so our access to music was very based on if it was on the radio.

k9g63x,"You usually don't celebrate your heroes until they are gone. That's the unfortunate happenstance with the passing of Harold Budd, pioneering pianist who worked on several albums with Brian Eno and several albums with Robin Guthrie (one of which has just come out). https://pitchfork.com/news/harold-budd-iconic-ambient-composer-dead-at-84/ I've spent a fairly good amount of time listening to Budd's work but, tonight, it feels like I haven't spent nearly as much time as I could have.

Sad that he has passed, but glad that he was able to live a long and hopefully fulfilling life.",34
ka9975,"Recently discovered some amazing Ethiopian Jazz artists from the 70's, thanks to the HBO show High Maintenance and started doing a deep dive through Youtube/Spotify. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the father of Ethiopian Jazz, **Mulatu Astatke**. Born in Jimma, he was forced into music at a very early age and was mostly classically trained. It wasn't until he came across Latin music while living in America when he started to make his own music with vibraphone and conga drums. My favourite tracks - [Tezeta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy-v-FgiUD8) & [En√© Alantchie Alnorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RP7Z_SFyNg). In 2015, he joined Black Jesus Experience, an Ethio-Jazz band from Australia. One of the most critical moments of the golden Ethio-Jazz age, was when **Hailu Mergia** joined **Dahlak Band** to create the album *Wede Harer Guzo.* The album came out during the Derg dictatorship, when censorship was prevalent and if songs had lyrics, they had to be in support of the government - therefore Hailu found a loophole and recorded a mostly improvised and instrumental album. Listen to the album [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vJAlNc36o0&list=PLMh9h8twoGyKxy4PJGb1_TLJMyg63bvyg)  Hailu now drives a taxi in Washington, DC to and from the airport as seen in a recent [documentary about him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKiJhJQv-mQ&t=508s) There's so many more artists to be discovered so please share any other amazing Ethio-Jazz artists of this era (or beyond!)",The only reason I even know about Mulatu Astatke is because of the Broken Flowers movie by Jim Jarmusch. I would absolutely love to dive deeper into this. Thank you for the topic,35
kbajzd,"Not too long ago there was what some people have called a ""tipping point"" to transgender visibility. This was largely marked by the presence of actress Laverne Cox in the popular television series *Orange Is The New Black*, with the actress even featuring on the cover of several popular magazines. Within context of US history, this was fairly unprecedented, as many transgender people, especially trans women and trans-feminine people, experience derision and violence for merely existing, and have historically often found themselves excluded from employment, housing, etc. The presence of transgender people and people who defy gender norms is not a new thing in society and did not come from nowhere, but for many people, seeing someone like Cox in a very public sphere was their first time engaging with a transgender person's contribution to television. The music world had a transgender tipping point, albeit on a lesser scale, several years ago when Laura Jane Grace of the popular punk band Against Me! came out. To many fans of rock and punk, she was the first major musician to emerge as transgender within the popular sphere. But even within the music world, she was not the first. As an example, there's the well-known musician [Wendy Carlos](https://youtu.be/Z3cab5IcCy8), who among other achievements provided the score to films like *A Clockwork Orange* and *The Shining*. But the bigger transgender tipping point in music may be within the past year or so. Today in the US there are a number of transgender musicians who have made an impact in the pop music world. I can't help but think of 100 gecs' Laura Les and the producer Sophie, the latter of whom has worked with mainstream musicians. And there's artists like Kim Petras and Dorian Electra who have broken into the pop world as singers. As a transgender woman, I have done a lot of searching for other transgender and gender non-conforming musicians and their role in history. There's an inherent difficulty in this: people have not always used identifiers like ""transgender"" to describe themselves, and it feels disrespectful to label someone with an identity that they did not use. As an example: would someone like [Gladys Bentley](https://youtu.be/7LeDbXK7H20) identify today as gender queer? There's no way of answering that question. But there are other older musicians, like trans woman [Jackie Shane](https://youtu.be/yUYW2iwimBw) who are still alive and able to speak about their own preferences. While trying to remain respectful of others, I would like to ask for examples of other musicians who are transgender or who may fit into the broader transgender umbrella of identities. There's a lot out there! But much of this history can be obscure, whether it be because of setbacks transgender people face, or the less accessible nature of some of their music. I'll leave you with a track by one of my favorite trans musicians: [Anohni](https://youtu.be/n35yiLa18R8) doing a cover of the incredibly important Velvet Underground track ""Candy Says""","This thread has been tagged as a list thread.

kbj3m3,"I've always loved music that tells stories about people or things that don't exist, and in my opinion I've been seeing less and less of those over the years. Those kinds of songs have always been huge in folk music, which is my main style, and with the folk revival of the 60s-70s they sort of entered the mainstream, but it seems like they died off after that. They held on a bit longer in rock music, and they've always been prominent in metal, but I feel like in pop and hip-hop they're pretty rare. Is it just because of my relative lack of experience with those genres? Or is it a larger societal trend? And if so, why? In my experience, I've been seeing more and more music either about personal experiences, or abstract concepts, and those are all valid topics but so are fictional stories and they don't seem to get nearly as much love. I've noticed this especially when performing these sorts of songs, people will often be shocked and be like ""do you really feel that way?"" Like no dumbass the narrator feels that way! It's a goddamn story! It seems like more and more people are unable to separate the content of the song from the person who sings it. Has anyone else noticed this?","No - Taylor Swift literally just released 2 great albums doing this. I agree it isn't as popular as it used to be, but especially with the success of folklore and evermore, prepare to see WAY more of it in the future",143
kc4cu2,"Please don't attack me, I come in peace. I don't mean for this to be a confrontation. But reading the 1999 discussion has finally pushed me over the edge to ask this. It's not that I hate Prince, although I do, but that's not the point. There are plenty of musicians I can't stand and would pay to avoid hearing, but *usually I understand why people like them.* I get it. The very factors that make me describe James Taylor's music as ""the auditory equivalent of the taste of lukewarm water"" are probably the same factors that his fans would describe as ""pleasant"" or ""soothing"" or something. I know we're hearing the same thing. Our brains are just reacting differently. And if just one person told me ""I love Prince, he's one of my favorite musicians,"" I would smile and nod and quietly note to myself not to take any album recommendations from them. But what confuses me is the fact that on forums like this one, Prince is held up as a genius of some sort. Not only that, but it is *taken for granted* that this is the case. It is the normative default opinion. Hell, scroll all the way to the bottom of the 1999 ADC post, and someone who feels the same way I do about Prince got buried under downvotes (admittedly he/she wasn't entirely politic about it), and the top response is ""I'm sorry for your loss."" I'm so confused. Admittedly I've never listened to an album of his, but I grew up in the 80s so I know the singles, and in the ADC discussion a lot of the songs I know are mentioned as recommended listens - ""Cream,"" ""Little Red Corvette,"" ""Purple Rain,"" etc. I don't get why. They strike me as among the most banal and forgettable pop music in a decade that virtually specialized in banal and forgettable pop music. You could switch ""Huey Lewis and the News"" or ""Debbie Gibson"" for Prince in this discussion and I'd be exactly as lost as to why we were holding this artist up as exemplary. I can think of a number of reasons why artists become highly-regarded legends, and I cannot apply any of them to Prince. He wasn't groundbreaking, at least as far as I can tell; I can't see what new genres or subgenres he founded, what other musicians' careers are defined almost single-handedly by his influence. I may not personally be a fan of Black Sabbath but I totally get how they're foundational to countless artists who followed. I can't see this with Prince. Or there are interesting and innovative fusions, when artists combine elements of genres or styles in brilliant ways. But I don't hear Prince as doing this either. What's he doing that the world wouldn't have been the same without? Or there's mastery of an art. Some artists just blow you the hell away with how good they are with what they do. Think of an instrument or a vocal style and I'll bet you can think of artists who boggle your mind with how elegantly they're perfected it. But there's nothing I've heard on a Prince song that stands out more than if a programmed robot had been doing the same thing. What am I missing? Finally, there's charisma, that great X-factor that sometimes just lifts that one specimen above the rest. It's hard to define, but you know it when you see it. Charisma is why Nirvana sounded fresh and original in the early 90s; Sonic Youth and Swans and the Melvins might have been doing it earlier, but Kurt Cobain had charisma. Or take Billie Eilish. I'm not at all sure I believe she can actually sing - in fact I'm pretty sure she can't - and I'm saying this as a fan. And maybe that's a great example, because she seems to be one of those artists you love or hate viscerally without ever being able to define quite why. In Prince's case, like I said, I hate him. Sincerely. I find his presence repulsive - sleazy, greasy, weasely. But I'm willing to acknowledge this might be one of those things I just don't ""get."" Like Donald Trump. People tell me that he's charismatic, and I have to believe them, on the objective basis that he, like Prince, has millions of adoring fans. His charisma is objectively verified. But apparently I'm immune to it, because I find him repulsive. Is there something of that in it? Please, Prince fans, as I said, I come in peace. I just want to know what it is you're hearing, or perceiving, that I don't. Because never has a revered artist fallen flatter on me than this one.","I‚Äôm friends with a guy who worked camera at Much Music (Music video channel in Toronto) 15+ years ago and heard a lot of famous musicians roll through the studio.  Like me (and you) he also kinda hated Prince‚Äôs vibe and music. Prince set up for his sound-check, performed a song and apparently then went over to the sound board, where the in-house technician had worked for years, and personally spent half an hour tweaking the board.  When he played again my buddy said he sounded 100 times better than any other famous band or performer that he‚Äôd heard play that room.  And he can play pretty much any instrument. Sounds like he‚Äôs a genuine savant?",270
kcjejk,"There are days where love, happiness, blah blah blah feel like a total fucking farce; where everything is shrouded in misery and disgust. And in times like that, sludge metal is the perfect soundtrack. Sludge ain't yer typical stoner jams, but rather the bastard birthed from doom metal and hardcore punk. The first sludge songs don't come from the metal world at all, but rather from hardcore punk legends Black Flag, with the B-side to their seminal album [My War](https://youtu.be/CwI9bEIm-bs). Dropping the tempo from their typical ferocious pace to a crawl, across three dirges Black Flag found a perfect backdrop for their typically bleak and angsty lyrics. Each song is a black hole, and while it turned off a lot of the punks that were listening, it became influential to the first major sludge band, and thus to all sludge to come. Black Flag weren't the only inspiration for the sludge sound, but is the most important. The Melvins took the sounds heard on My War, and twisted them. They are a band that is overall hard to define, but across their early records like Bullhead and my personal favorite [Lysol](https://youtu.be/JtO_Awk4pqU), they helped create a new language for sludge musicians, one that had a ripple effect across the music world. That's right, without sludge, Nirvana likely wouldn't have turned out the way that they did. In the Melvins' wake there were an explosion of sludge bands looking to bring their grimey sound to the masses. There's the often bloozy Southern sound of the NOLA scene, with bands like Eyehategod and Crowbar; there's the weird and wild Acid Bath, and the utter pits of despair generated by Grief and Noothgrush. Sludge wasn't just an American sound; one of the most acclaimed sludge bands is Japan's Corrupted, whose lengthy tracks often combined heavy riffage with quieter moments of calm. In the wake of these sludge bands there emerged a new scene of bands looking to combine the heaviness of sludge with sounds not typically heard within the genre. Originally called atmospheric sludge, post-metal bands took their cue from Oakland's Neurosis to present moments of lightness and interesting time signatures to the scene, and bands like Isis and Pelican have garnered more fans for sludge metal than the original scene did. I would be remiss to not include Baroness and Mastodon here. Originally a part of Georgia's sludge scene, with each record they expanded their sound, and eventually broke into the public's consciousness, with both of the bands releasing a slew of popular records. While neither play sludge anymore, it has been a pivotal part of their original sound, and it's doubtful they would have become the band's they are if they weren't originally interested in sludge. There is a lot more to the sludge story than what I included here, but hopefully this serves as a good primer. Maybe some of you can contribute more in the comments. I'll leave here a list of some of my favorite sludge records: [Corrupted/Noothgrush - Split](https://youtu.be/taCVj60Qmiw) [Grief - Come To Grief](https://youtu.be/68iDMP_5zfw) [Thou - Heathen](https://youtu.be/J9FPhpuNrwg) [Burning Witch - Crippled Lucifer](https://youtu.be/_qwA1sivuHo) [Agoraphobic Nosebleed - Arc](https://youtu.be/aBngZL0gfec) [Salome - Terminal](https://youtu.be/fDWNybkBtBY) [Asunder/Graves At Sea - Split LP](https://youtu.be/pJAHyaJmIG4) [Primitive Man - Scorn](https://youtu.be/JQ4f15Xxnpk) [The Body - All The Waters Of The Earth Turn To Blood](https://youtu.be/18E9nf57H48) People interested in sludge but want something gnarlier or more extreme can check out the death-doom and drone doom subgenres as well. Perhaps there will be posts to come about those genres? Anyway, what do you think about sludge? What bands and releases do you like the most? Is there anything in particular about the sound that you dislike? What are the releases you would recommend to people looking to get into the genre? Let's talk sludge!","Not sure if this is the proper place to ask, but after years of reading about music genres I still don't know the difference between sludge and stoner for sure.

kewy67,"To be fair, I‚Äôm not a big prog fan these days. I‚Äôve started to develop negative opinions on Genesis, and the Mars Volta can be exhausting & overwhelming. I don‚Äôt love Porcupine Tree, and I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Godbluff & Still Life. Gentle Giant wasn‚Äôt my thing, as well, and Jethro Tull is ok. There is prog that can be over the top, bombastic & geeky, but I‚Äôve always liked Yes. Yes is absolutely one of my favorite prog bands, and they‚Äôre definitely one of the most important bands for that genre. The Yes Album, Fragile & Close to the Edge are excellent albums, and they transcended prog in so many ways.  I *love* the vibes/melodies for those albums. The Yes Album, Fragile & Close to the Edge have happy, uplifting interpretations of prog that really added a lot to the genre. Those records have cheery, feel-good tunes/sections that were joyful and *fun*; even when things were very technical, Yes excelled at incorporating optimism & enthusiasm into their music. ‚ÄúYours Is No Disgrace‚Äù, ‚ÄúStarship Trooper‚Äù, ‚ÄúRoundabout‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd You and I‚Äù (and more) made you feel *great*; The Yes Album, Fragile & Close to the Edge encouraged you to get out there, jump around and live life to the fullest.  There was *incredible* instrumentation, too. Steve Howe‚Äôs guitar playing speaks for itself; he is absolutely a virtuoso, and I love how his style has bits of country. He nailed acoustic parts, too, and Chris Squire‚Äôs basslines are phenomenal! Chris played these muscular, nimble basslines that were ridiculously complex, elevating the role of the bass to amazing extents. Chris‚Äô tones are brilliant, and Bill Bruford‚Äôs drumming is classy, extremely technical & very creative. I love Bill‚Äôs jazzy bits, and his beats went above and beyond the typical rock drummer. The Yes Album, Fragile & Close to the Edge have masterful instrumentation, and Rick Wakeman‚Äôs keyboards added an elegant/classical feel to Fragile & Close to the Edge.  The Yes Album, Fragile & Close to the Edge have tight structures, too, along with excellent songwriting and distinctive moods. Whenever I listen to those albums, I‚Äôm stunned by the structures of the songs; the technicality, odd time signatures, etc. never got in the way of the song. Everything is there for a reason, and The Yes Album, Fragile & Close to the Edge have epic adventures. The Yes Album is very balanced, with smooth sounds and a more modest feel, and Fragile is a great distillation of Yes‚Äô classic era. Fragile has the solo pieces and an upbeat, vibrant feel, with ambitious parts that were presented in a tight way, and Close to the Edge has gorgeous, extremely lush sections with psychedelic tinges.  The Yes Album, Fragile & Close to the Edge are classics, and they‚Äôre among the best that prog can offer for you. I‚Äôm more of a punk/alternative/experimental guy these days, but I can‚Äôt tire of The Yes Album, Fragile & Close to the Edge.","I remember being in high school in the early 80s and feeling that I missed out on seeing Yes in concert.  Then they reformed for 90125 and I reluctantly went to see them because Steve Howe was not in the band. But they opened with Yours Is No Disgrace and I got such a big smile on my face.  That song and that Album (the Yes Album) are so good. Subsequently Yes have toured so many times in so many iterations that I eventually got to see Steve Howe with the band but it was so nice to hear those tunes that first time. Like you, I'm a very selective prog fan but Yes have some great stuff, especially the three albums you bring up.",35
kf9dg3,"Genres are a common topic, they're a pretty useful way to describe music and distinguish scenes, and people kinda get carried away with them. On here often it's rightfully brought up how focusing on genres can hurt music by acting like they're precise scientific categories everything has to fit into, so it's cool when people exploit the fact that genres are really just arbitrary. One way this happens is by people making ultra-specific pseudogenes to describe their music and the small scene around them, like Rustie calling themself ""Aquacrunk"" or Liturgy's infamous ""Transcendental Black Metal"" And now I wanted to get into the slightly less serious side of people coining their own genres. Plenty of genres start as a joke, such as 'Witch House', today I wanted to go over notable ones meant as a joke specifically insulting the music it describes. And at the end, I'll name the very most insulting one of all \-Dad Rock By far the most popular of any, likely because when you hear the term, you instantly know it's talking about the mellow classic rock and hard rock found on the radio. While meant as a joke, it's become a term of endearment, with dads everywhere adopting the term, proudly referring to their own favorite music as 'dad rock' \-Butt rock an undeniably hilarious term for the post-grunge type of music around in 90s and 00s. Bands like puddle of mudd, staind, trapt. It took itself far too seriously, everyone knew an asshole frat guy way too into it, so the term stuck. The sure sign of a butt-rock band was that they completely faded from memory the second they were no longer relevant. \-Yacht Rock The most mellow of dad rock, bands like Toto that could be enjoyed by any dentist on their yacht. This one became a fairly legitimate genre name. It has a RYM tag, that means it's real to me. \-Mallcore/Mallemo Mall is a common prefix, most commonly seen here to refer to the edgy pop-punk/emo-pop you'd hear in Hot Topic that's primarily responsible for the screamo scene to have to start saying 'skramz' \-Fidget house Another term started as a joke among producers that ended up becoming something used sincerely.  coined by Jesse Rose and Switch ""as a joke, which has now gone a little too far."" A microgenre of electro-house that's dirtier and glitchy, and usually has a bunch of choppy vocal samples \-Bro country, brostep, and brocore Bro is one of the most popular prefixes here, Bro country and brostep becoming, for the most part, totally legitimate genres themself. Brocore referring to ""bro"" style hardcore. The genres are different, but there's the same attitude here of ""These bros aren't where they belong and derailed our genre!"" It's a bad sentiment, but decently sympathetic seeing how bro country is 90% of what people complain about with country, how 'dubstep' means a completely different thing than it did pre-skrillex, and the problem of assholes moshing in the punk scene. \-Easycore Overlaps with brocore, somewhat became a legitimate genre. It's like Hardcore. But instead of Hard, it's ""easy"". Hilarious. \-Landfill indie Most of these involve bro or mall, landfill indie is such a fantastic and creative name. It's hard to describe landfill indie, but you know it when you hear it. Indie rock that's upbeat and energetic, has that alt-rock feel but still pop-ish. Landfill indie were typically one hit wonder bands that for some reason, always happened to come out of england. Think ""Maximo Park."" Think 2007 and you're at the pub with the lads. \-Crabcore Objectively, the funniest name on the list. Directly making fun of the band Attack! Attack!, specifically the way one of the band members assumes a low squatting crab stance while playing guitar in their music video ""Stick Stickly"". Instantly became a meme, and even the band themselves admitted they thought it was funny. \-mu-core Music popular on the 4chan music board /mu/, especially albums found on the infamous /mu/ essentials list. There's one of these for almost any site, tumblrcore, redditcore, but mucore is the most significant. It became necessary given how many people who thought they were on the deepest level of the cutting edge for listening to Death Grips. \-Twinklecore used to refer to the newer style of math rock and midwest emo that has clean ""twinkly"" guitars. Often inspired by American Football, features open tunings and noodly riffs. \-Weedmo refers to the new wave of 'slacker' emo thats mixed with pop punk. most notably includes Mom Jeans. People only use this talking about bands they don't like. Mom Jeans gets called this all the time, but prince daddy and the hyena never gets called it because they're pretty well-loved (but admittedly is totally weedmo) And now, honorable mentions before I get to the #1 most insulting genre name. MOR (middle of the road), Hair Metal (also called 'Pantyhose metal in sweden, so i'm told), Mumble rap, glam blues, meme rap, PBR&B, scenecore, adidas rock, fashion punk, buffet country And now our grand champion \-IDM It was never intended as an insult. But this does something not a single other genre name does, it manages to not only insult the music called IDM, but also everything that ISN'T IDM, by implying it's dance music that isn't intelligent. The term is insanely stupid, and I don't think anyone even likes it. Virtually every artist called 'idm' regularly speaks out about how they fucking hate it. Understandable seeing as how unfitting it is. I mean, who out there is getting down to Autechre, honestly? The idea that electronic music = dance has been a bad stigma for awhile. The most insulting part about this is it isn't even an intentional active effort to insult. Someone really meant ""Intelligent dance music."" So now I ask you. Do you have any favorites? Are there any you use? Ones you made up yourself? Is there such a thing as a 'fake' genre, and when does a name go from ""joke"" to ""legitimate terminology?""","Isn't ""krautrock"" the ultimate of these? ""Kraut"" was a derogatory term for Germans dating back to WWI.",273
kfn4ft,"I have read all around and tried a ton of strategies, but my friends and I all struggle to get any traction. Can anyone share their thoughts on the state of the music industry/publicity nowadays?  For reference, this article: [https://www.muserlists.com/post/how-to-get-your-music-on-spotify-playlists](https://www.muserlists.com/post/how-to-get-your-music-on-spotify-playlists) covers pitching to Spotify playlists, contacting third party curators, and paying for playlisting companies. I can't tell if any of these are effective for most people.",The problem with all of these is you have to pay to play or already have a big following. The only way ive heard of actually working is finding the playlist maker on social media and DMing them and asking if you can get your song on the playlist. Even still you probably have to pay around $100 but you can build a mutually beneficial working relationship with the playlister for future songs.,125
kg75u0,"Most of them have really basic portraits of the musician on a solid color background. They almost remind of stock images with how uninspired a lot of them are. I know it's probably the simplest solution. You can't have an infinite amount of covers for the same Chopin nocturnes. It's probably better to show off the musician but I end up getting sort of distracted when listening and end up minimizing it on Spotify. Second is post-grunge albums. A decent chunk of them look sort of amateurish or have the same problem as the classical albums but at least a decent amount of them have character. Indie, and alternative rock usually have the best looks. If they have photography, the pictures are usually pretty creative or colorful and otherwise they might have some graphic design that really tries to portray the vibe of the album. I think it comes from wanting to show off where they stand out whereas in something like Classical or Post-grunge it's about something commercially acceptable and easily understandable.

kh1rrp,"This might not be the hottest take but I've noticed certain parallels between the ""[rockism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockism_and_poptimism)"" debate, and 19th-century developments in classical music. I wonder if it might be useful to generalise ""rockism"" into something broader, applicable to more styles and forms in music. I propose the term ""artism"", defined roughly as:  *An ideology which holds to the ideal of the musician as a solitary creative genius, and of the music as the true, uncompromised expression of his vision.* (Note ""his"" vision; I feel this kind of thinking intersects heavily with Great Man theory and with a culture that has long socialised men to Follow Their Dreams (TM) and women to clean up after them ‚Äì but that's another discussion.) I call it art*ism*, because it takes this Romantic ideal of the art*ist* and turns it into an ideology, an *-ism*, with its own values, dogmas, heroes and villains; it always leads to this peculiar disdain for people who are making or enjoying music the ""wrong"" way. You might also call it ""artsification"". But which specific developments am I talking about, and why do I feel they can be lumped together under one heading? #Classical The stiff, snooty atmosphere surrounding classical music is a relatively recent invention. It was always the music of the upper classes, true; but those upper classes did not always see music as monolithic works of art that must be enjoyed in silence and darkness. Until the 19th century, it was understood that music served some other purpose: the glory of God; the glory of the composer's wealthy patron; or simply an evening's entertainment. (Note how many Baroque compositions take the form of dance suites.) Although talented composers were certainly admired, they were viewed more as skilled craftsmen working within those constraints, than as uncompromising visionaries. Nor were performers tasked with simply carrying out the composer's vision to perfection. Baroque *basso continuo* notation left musicians to improvise basslines based on a series of root notes ‚Äì not unlike rock band practice where the chord progression sheet is the main form of notation. Lead instrumentalists and singers for their part were expected to add their own little flourishes to the music as written, showing skill and creativity. They were performers in a real sense, expected to entertain, improvise, and play to the ‚Äì often rowdy ‚Äì crowd. It was mostly 19th-century German composers who demanded silence and respect for the music as a standalone work of art, and began seeing themselves as Artists with a capital A. And their Art was to be enjoyed in a specifically defined context. I recall reading somewhere that some of Mozart's arias became popular ditties in his day, performed far beyond the opera house (even by street musicians) and that this was a badge of honour for a composer: you had a hit! Wagner, by contrast, long resisted separate performances of a breakout hit like the Ride of the Valkyries ‚Äì you had to enjoy it as part of the whole, or not at all. (Singles vs. albums, anyone?) In recent years there have been experiments with classical concerts in the setting of a pop concert, with listeners standing instead of seated and allowed to mingle, talk, and grab a beer during the performance. It's seen as a bit of a gimmicky experiment now, but this was the standard mode of classical performance for centuries! However, generations of classical musicians and listeners have been raised on the ideals of Wagner and Mahler, which forbid so much as tapping your foot or nodding your head along to the music in the classical concert hall. #Jazz I've only just begun to explore the jazz canon, but there seems to have been a similar rise in pretentiousness or ""artsiness"" within jazz sometime around the 1940s-'50s. Bebop put more emphasis on complexity and instrumental skill than on catchy, danceable tunes. Eventually this led to extremes like free jazz, which is definitely not meant to be easily appreciated. More broadly, isn't it odd that we've come to see ""jazz"" as a separate *form* of music ‚Äì alongside classical, pop, and folk ‚Äì rather than a *genre*? I've been listening to music from the '20s and '30s a lot, and in those days such a distinction would have been silly, not to mention impossible to draw. Jazz overlapped heavily with blues; with show tunes and Tin Pan Alley pop; even with country (Western swing!). It was one genre among many, not an isolated tradition. Today, we see it as a form of its own, somewhere between pop and classical in terms of snootiness and exclusivity. I see this as evidence that ""artism"" took hold of jazz at some point and didn't let go. I vaguely recall a TV news item about the North Sea Jazz Festival, maybe 5-10 years ago. It shone the spotlight on a band from Japan or South Korea noted for their infectious dance grooves. One of the band members was interviewed and said something along the lines of, *""Our audiences are often surprised to find that jazz isn't just 'listening music'; that it can be 'dance music' as well.""* A line that certainly would have sounded bizarre to Louis Armstrong or Benny Goodman! #Rock The debates around ""rockism"" are probably more familiar to the average reader of /r/LetsTalkMusic, so I won't recap them too elaborately here. The long and short of it is that starting in the 1960s, a norm was introduced that ""serious"" artists (modelled after the example of the Beatles and Bob Dylan) should write their own songs; doing ""cover versions"" or working with off-stage songwriters ‚Äì both of which had been perfectly normal before ‚Äì became frowned upon. For even more rock & roll cred, the songwriter-performer should also have Something To Say: a poetic and/or political message that went deeper than just another silly love song. The long-playing album (preferably with meaningful cover art and elaborate liner notes) was glorified over the hit single. Later, similar norms were applied against drum machines, synthesisers and sampling, in favour of ""real musicians"" who played ""real instruments"". #Tentative conclusion Certainly, there are many differences between the three forms of snobbery outlined above. ""Artism"" in jazz glorifies the improvising performer; in the classical world, it treats the performer (except for a handful of top-flight soloists) as a mere tool in the hands of the genius composer and conductor; in rock, it insists that the roles be combined into the same person. In rock, it is bound up with a mythology of rebellion against The Man; in classical music, it upholds conformism and elite values. However, I feel that the definition of ""artism"" I gave at the beginning applies, one way or another, to each of them, and that it's a useful concept. A useful shorthand to remind us that each of these musical forms had their own phase of increasing romanticisation of the Great Artist (and increasing disdain for the Mere Entertainer) ‚Äì and more importantly, that *none of them started out that way*. # Artism vs. accessibility One hypothesis to ponder: *In a rock/pop context, ""artism"" was defeated; in classical music and jazz, it became the dominant philosophy, and that's part of the reason why those forms have been relegated to the margins of the cultural landscape.* In rock and pop music, rockist ideals never really dominated broadly; artists working in a very different mode kept topping charts and shaping genres. Starting from the 1980s, rockism was named as such and increasingly called out. Today, these are dynamic and accessible forms, where it's relatively easy to go from casual fan to connaisseur, or from bedroom guitarist to jam-session regular to member of a small local band. In classical music... Many passionate classical musicians and music lovers make it their life's work to convince mainstream audiences that classical music ""isn't boring"", and it always feels like they're fighting an uphill battle. Not in the least against many of their own colleagues who roll their eyes at any attempt to introduce more flair and expressivity into the rigid classical tradition: watered-down kitsch! I own a [book](https://www.thomasrap.nl/wp-content/uploads/imagecache/cb6e8fd517815663fc4d61263be7a23c_cache_.png) that's supposedly meant to raise enthusiasm for classical music among newcomers to the style ‚Äì and even that starts with a long gatekeeping screed against Ludovico Einaudi! How mysterious that it's hard to draw casual listeners into classical music... As for jazz, I would guess that a young person who isn't a music wonk tends to have two associations with jazz, if they're aware it exists at all: 1) one of the standard tropes used to evoke a ""classy"", ""old-timey"" setting; and 2) ""that difficult music with 15-minute saxophone solos that eccentric old dudes are into"". It's become an insular, highly ""artsy"" thing, not an integral part of the popular music tradition as it once was. (Though I'll admit I don't know a lot about modern jazz or its audience so this might be too black-and-white; this post is meant more to provoke thought and debate than deliver hard-and-fast verdicts, anyway.) #Closing remarks Is ""artism"" with all its pretensions then always a bad thing? Some nuance is needed. I'm not saying that everything needs to be accessible and bite-sized. I too prefer to hear my favourite rock songs in the context of the original album (or a thoughtfully compiled playlist) than as a 20-second snippet in a commercial or an autotuned RnB cover on the supermarket PA. And I'd rather listen to one of those fancy-schmancy early music ensembles doing Bach and Buxtehude than to an Andr√© Rieu concert. Some kinds of music demand longer and deeper attention from the listener than others, and that's perfectly valid. And some musicians maybe need that ideal of the visionary Great Artist in order to push themselves to innovate and come up with truly new things ‚Äì though it's certainly no prerequisite: the aforementioned Bach was one of those composers who in their day were seen as masters of a well-defined craft; his canonisation as a mythical genius began decades after his death. And many of the most inspired pop songs were recorded long before anyone had heard of Bob Dylan. I guess my main beef with ""artism"" is that it throws up hurdles and judgements against the *gradual development* of interest in music. In a healthy music scene, people can have varying degrees of interest. People drift from casual listeners to hardcore fans and back; they explore different genres; as creators, they combine and borrow from different styles. It may not always produce results that satisfy your ears, but the general process should be celebrated, not condemned.","TBH part of what made jazz so exciting imo is that in its initial dixieland form, it brought back some of the magic of older classical music - improvisation, meaning that every performance of say Tiger Rag was different, unusual tunings and rhythms (""bent"" notes and ""swung"" notes), and the use of orchestral instruments in a way that could compete with folk music. Stylistically, old New Orleans jazz wasn't that different from African-tinged offshoots of classical music like ragtime, cakewalks, or the habanera, but the way it was **made** was something that hadn't been heard for decades (and hadn't been easy to propagate before the emergence of sound recordings as classical music scores have no place for unevenly divided notes, microtones, and improvisation). 1950s rock and roll (before it simultaneously became more commercialized - with the rise of teen idols and manufactured bands - and more artistic) had a lot of the same traits as dixieland and as pre-Wagner classical music.",62
khk4v0,"I always look forward to the Top Ten Albums of the Year feature that Metacritic puts out and I made a small infographic to highlight some trends. It is a work in progress and I would welcome any criticism, perceived errors, or suggestions as to what data would be worthwhile to extract. Considering annotating the album release number (ie, is it a debut, sophomore, the fifteen album, etc), ""missing in action"" which are highly reviewed albums each year that didn't crack the top 25 or 30, and noting artists which consistently place in consecutive releases. [The infographic](https://i.imgur.com/CAxlmEq.png) and the most recent [Best of 2020: Music Critic Top Ten Lists](https://www.metacritic.com/feature/music-critics-pick-top-10-best-albums-of-2020) from Metacritic. Some noteworthy aberrations - 2018 seems to have been the weirdest year overall. **Noname**'s *Room 25* was the highest rated album of 2018 yet it didn't receive a *single first place* ranking. The highest overall ranked album, **Kacey Musgraves**' *Golden Hour* (also the highest ranked country album of any year by a massive margin) is the only yearly top rank to receive neither the most 1st or 2nd place rankings on individual lists. It was also the only year where the album with the most 1st place rankings placed 4th overall - **Idles**' *Joy as an Act of Resistance.* There seems to have been a shift away from male artists and vocalists to female artists and female-fronted bands in the popular scene. Electronic music hasn't fallen out of favor but it definitely seems to be doing better lately when it is multi-genre. Singer-songerwriters get reviewed well but doesn't necessarily translate to end of the year lists. (Not shown in genre. Might have to highlight that) Pop music often gets higher rankings than their album rating would suggest, such as those by **Adele, Rihanna, The 1975,** and **Carly Rae Jepsen**. Moreso than any other genre *Small note, 2020's rankings are unfinished and still updating. Genre isn't always so clean and I expect there will be issue with several categorizations.

It's so cool being in the same room as your favorite artists and listening to them work their craft.

kjk67f,"To me, 99% of Christmas music is unoriginal and cringe worthy terrible. If I had to put a finger on it, I'd say it has to do with the fact that it shares many similarities with ultra uatchy Commercial Jingles. Commercial Jingles made to be just on the cusp of unbearably annoying, and catchy enough that they get stuck in your head the instant you hear them. If I had to guess I'd say that modern Christmas music shares these features because it started at the beginning of America's capitalist boom, and alot of Commercial Xmas Music was written for commercials. I have no evidence to base this on, its just a guess.  Thoughts? Am I right about Xmas music or am I just a Grinch.

kk9gcb,"With the advent of music streaming site, YouTube, and social media many bands from the alternative movement have undergone a rediscovery.  For my first pick I present to you the [Chainsaw Kittens ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7Fo3gFeSFjoFg4ky6NyRjC?nd=1). An alternative rock band out of Norman, Oklahoma like Flaming Lips and the much more accessible of the two bands. Fronted by the dynamic Tyson Meade with a whopping 460 monthly listeners on Spotify a month this band is a perfect example of the kind of bands I‚Äôd like to bring much more attention to.  They deserve so much better. That‚Äôs not just underrated that‚Äôs literally forgotten. That‚Äôs really unbelievable for a band as talented and dynamic as this. Fans of Jane‚Äôs Addiction, Smashing Pumpkins, and 90‚Äôs alternative/grunge have a lot to like in this band.

So what happened? Why didn‚Äôt Chainsaw Kittens ‚Äúmake it‚Äù and sell a bunch of records and have success on MTV? Well no one can say for certain perhaps it‚Äôs as simple as they just missed their moment. Perhaps there were just too many other bands in releasing records for them to standout in a year like 1994 with well over 300 major label releases that year to get recognition. Maybe it‚Äôs their band name.  Whatever the reason it‚Äôs unfortunate because the band deserved a much better fate. With 5 full length lp and 3 ep from 1989-2000 it sure wasn‚Äôt from lack of trying.

kkmbs6,"I love reading music biographies/memoirs and reading about the 1980s-90s Minneapolis and DC indie/punk scenes got me thinking about place-based scenes in the years since. My assumption is that the internet has largely made that kind of local scene - specific to a geographical area - a lot less relevant in music. Do you think that's true? Are there still vibrant, place-based music scenes? If not, what do you think are the positive and negative effects of this? Besides the obvious accessibility of music that has been part of the online nature of entertainment in general.","I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot. I came up in the mid/late 2000s in the Dominican Republic. There was a really cool rock/metal scene that wasn‚Äôt huge but was very active. Shows every weekend. Not many bands but it gave those of us who played a lot of playing experience. I moved to Florida in 2009 and spent two years there. The scene was also super cool, a lot bigger than what I knew. Lots of touring bands that would play the smaller venues. When I found a band we also got to play a lot because again not that many bands. I now live in New York. When I moved here in 2011 I lived in a small college town for a bit with not much of a scene. The bigger college near me had local shows with bands formed by the students, our college had like one band. No touring bands came through. We were an hour away from the city though so going to hear music wasn‚Äôt a hassle. I now live in Brooklyn and haven‚Äôt found a scene as active as I knew in DR and FL. I find the large amount of people that live here make it hard for the scene to be tight. The scenes now revolve more around a group of bands than actual genres. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a hardcore/metal scene, but there‚Äôs a scene for like, these 5-10 bands. Then another scene for these other 5-10 bands. And so on. I now work professionally in jazz, and the scene with that is a lot more put together, and that‚Äôs due to a few factors. Jazz doesn‚Äôt consist of ‚Äúbands‚Äù. In rock and so, a band is a non-changing unit of 3-6 people or so. If the drummer can‚Äôt do the gig, it‚Äôs not happening. In jazz it‚Äôs more modular. Since musicians can sightread and the music is improvisatory, it‚Äôs a non issue to do a gig with a different drummer, pianist, etc. It has to be this way because musicians are actually making a living with these gigs. Rock gigs don‚Äôt often pay as much (if you‚Äôre local). But because subbing is so common, networking is very important, so you need to know all the musicians to be on their radar so you can possibly be hit up for gigs. Also, since jazz is improvisatory music, it relies on the live aspect of the music. Records are just snapshots of what bands do. Rock albums are the opposite and are the sound the band strives for, live shows only try to replicate the record usually. Because of this, rock bands can exist on the internet and independently of a scene. With the prevalence of the internet now, it‚Äôs easy to see how local scenes are smaller and less active because a lot of what musicians want can be achieved online.",193
kl6r9v,"As similar as a music taste my friends have always had to me, I feel like I never found anyone who delved into Fugazi the way I did. I, personally, find them to be one of those perfect bands.   1. Never put out a bad album, in fact I feel they got better all the way to the end.  2. Had a message. Went against the system. (And some awesome obscure lyricism) 3. Had values. Decided to stop being a band over raising ticket prices over $5. 4. Influence. I think the Argument put a huge dent in shaping the way indie music sounded after that.  5. The only band to put on shows I wish I was at. Not cause I like the band so much, but they understood that shows were about energy and enhanced them with that mindset.  My personal fav albums are Red Medicine and the Argument. I‚Äôm always going back forth on which one tops. Anyone have any favs, unfavs, memories or opinions to share?","The first time I ever heard of Fugazi was about 30 years ago when I was around twelve years old. I was a little skater metalhead and an older friend of a friend who was into punk had a ramp with the band's name spray painted on it. In my naivety, I thought it was some sort of subversive way of saying ""fuck Ozzy"", as in Ozzy Osbourne. I figured punks maybe didn't like Ozzy and because I was a huge fan of both Black Sabbath and Ozzy's solo stuff, I didn't ever ask for fear of embarrassing myself. It was about a decade later before I heard the band's name again and recalled that ramp but I  didn't actually listen to them for about another ten years. I happened to be listening to a local college radio station one night and they played something off the ""Instrument"" soundtrack, and I was instantly captivated. If you don't know that album, it's very uncharacteristic of the band but it scratched an itch I didn't realize I had at the time for instrumental rock music. That was the only album I knew until one day I bought Repeater on a whim at a CD store. From there I bought In on the Kill Taker and a few other albums.  I got to see a jazz show about seven or eight years ago in DC where their bassist, Joe Lally was playing his bass using a purple dildo on the frets. Needless to say, it was a weird show. Anyways, at best I have remained a casual listener but they've held a place in my brain for a very long time due to that skate ramp in my friend's driveway. I still put them on sometimes but mostly it's when one of their songs comes on when shuffling my Spotify playlist.",85

kn198b,"I recently discovered Glen Campbell and while he wrote neither of them, his versions of [Wichita Lineman](https://youtu.be/Q8P_xTBpAcY) and [Gentle on My Mind](https://youtu.be/mfMnNqn-hKg) are both iconic. My thing is, you've probably heard this before: I like basically everything except for Country. But why is this? And also, Gentle on my Mind especially, these sound closer to what I would call *folk* rather than *country.* And I feel like the biggest distinction is really the lyrics. They're both very poetic and evocative in a way that I don't associate with country music. I guess there's some Johnny Cash hits that might fit that bill, but he tended towards a lot of rambler's ballads. Story songs.  But what do you think? Am I just trying to draw the line in the sand between country, folk, and bluegrass too harshly, or have I just missed a lot of good, poetic country songs? *and I don't mean for this to be a recommendation thread but I would totally not mind some recs.*","With regards to terminology, country music was initially known by a variety of different names including Southern folk music, Hillbilly music, and western music. Eventually, the term ""country and western"". From there, it became shortened to just country music. Hank Williams actually topped Billboard's [Top Folk Records chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Top_Folk_Records_of_1949). It was only in December 1949 that Billboard changed the name of the chart to [Top Country & Western Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Top_Country_%26_Western_Records_of_1950).  With regards to their history, both country and modern folk music had developed in the same way that other popular music styles had previously developed: with the migration of rural folks into urban cities. But whereas country music developed in various urban cities in the southern and western regions of the United State of America, modern folk music was a phenomenon that largely developed in one particular city: New York. Sure, artists from other parts of the USA eventually adopted the modern folk style but during the 1940s and 1950s, it was very much associated as a New York thing.  Now musically, there is a slight difference between country music and modern folk music. Both shares a common origin in the folk music of European-Americans, including the folk music descended from English, Irish and Scottish immigrants known as [Appalachian music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_music). But early country music had more diverse influences than modern folk music. This included the folk music developed in the Western regions of the United States of America, hence the term [Western music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_music_(North_America)). Gospel was another influence, hence the proliferation of Christian songs in country music. And then there was the influence from the blues and jazz, particularly on western swing and bluegrass. Modern folk music didn't had all these different influences. Consequently, the modern folk music that the likes of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger developed was usually stripped down and rather sombre, at least before Bob Dylan went electric. It was somewhat more similar to traditional folk ballads. Even to this day, modern folk music is still largely associated with and stereotyped as a solo singer-songwriter playing an acoustic guitar. Not exactly party music. But country music could be party music. Bluegrass, western swing, and honky tonk were mostly lively stuff with more instruments than typically found in modern folk music.  Hence if you're coming from a background of someone that's into modern folk music with its predominantly stripped down acoustics and sombre tone, then you're not going to find a lot of country music very appealing. Same roots but different directions. There are some country artists that straddle the line between the two genres in varying degrees. You already mentioned Johnny Cash but there's also [Kris Kristofferson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbqGWTxwZEA), [Emmylou Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4bufWfOnuA), [Townes Van Zandt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zprRZ2wFQD4), [Gillian Welch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwjgskF5Qa4), [Guy Clark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6bZ37nexSY), [Nanci Griffith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBeP8dzYdg), etc. You could also try out some older artists like [Hank Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WXYjm74WFI), [Jimmie Rodgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbzc77Tz6PA), the [Carter Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewnfWoSQz3o), etc. If you're already into fusion genres like folk rock, then country rock might be right up your alley.",123

kodn79,"As part of my Masters, we studied the concept of being 'tasteless', when it comes to consuming music. In short, treating all genres and musical styles as valid, as important as each other, not having a preference for one particular style of music. William Brooks, author of ""On Being Tasteless"", suggests that it takes work to be truly tasteless - we're surrounded by our peers, our society.. all of which may force us to make a choice and develop a specific taste in music in a bid to identify ourselves as part of a specific tribe/culture. By being tasteless, Brooks suggests, we might open up opportunities to meet people we may not have met, experiences we may not have had before, with tastelessness allowing us to move past our own habits and histories.  Personally, I used to listen to a lot of mainstream pop music. More recently, I have expanded my music library and listen to anything from Salsa to Folk.. as a result, I now feel more open to different subcultures, fashions, people, and feel as if it has changed my outlook on the world, even!  Are YOU tasteless? What do you think of this theory/concept?","While I guess I‚Äôm tasteless in the sense that I‚Äôll give all music a shot, I definitely have preferences. I stick to rock and all its sub genres (hard rock, grunge, punk, etc), heavy metal and all its sub genres, and pop.",51
kot4t1,"I recently got my first vinyl player for Christmas and let me tell you, it's one of the best gifts I've ever gotten. As someone who loves music history, being able to take care and put on a physical record while I get to hold the artwork *in my hands*, while I get to look at all the interesting design choices that goes into the whole thing, how I get to look at the whole list of people who worked on it, it's so much fun.  But then I started thinking on how I got to this point: a couple years ago I don't think I'd have anything but a passing interest of ""oh that's cool I guess, but I can just play this on Spotify"". Even now if you say ""I like listening to music"" it sounds like a passive hobby. So for me, what brought me to making music an ""active"" hobby for me was a couple things: -Throwing stuff into a playlist rather than curating it. I use playlists mostly to organize why I like certain sounds (e.g. heavy bass, driving playlist, experimental sounds). Focusing less time on making the playlist perfect and more so just making it a song dump. I almost never throw on a playlist I just use it to organize. -I write about music... a lot, I love searching up the history and meanings to my favorite songs, so for the past couple of months I've been writing in a word document the history behind the tracks. -When I talk about music with my friends I try my best to be as specific to what and why I liked it. Usually I like to compare it to other things I've heard. -Becoming confident in what I liked and why. I used to be scared in sharing what I listen to just if I thought someone didn't know who that person/band was. My music taste is centered around rap, electronic music, and  little bit of alternative r&b and soft rock. Even when I mention someone that my friends don't know, I try to get them engaged by talking about who they like and ask if they have any recommendations, and comparing what sounds we both like :) There's more I can say but I'll leave it there for your guys' input. Obviously given the subreddit, I feel like we all like actively participating in music in one way or another. So how do you make listening to music an active thing to do? Edit: are there any songs in particular that you like to gush over and talk about that make you feel like you're activity participating in music discussion too?","I don't know. I'm just the kind of person who will quite happily spend several hours with a pair of headphones on, just staring at the ceiling. It's something I've done for as long as I can remember. I've just always gravitated toward music.  I'm at a point now where genre has become kind of meaningless to me. There's so much talent spread across the board. And it's the talent that draws me in; whether it be in musicianship, lyricism, or just general creativity. Lately, though, the underground/alternative hip hop scene has been pretty amazing. I think 2020 was arguably one of the best years for the genre.",128
kpektp,"If you clicked on this, i have to assume that music makes your life better, helps you cope, teaches you various things, allows you to relax etc. we have all had good and bad experiences in life including myself and music has always been there for me, my bands and artists have always been there when ive needed them most.

What makes music even more amazing is there is always something new to discover.",105
kprd7r,"Nearly all of the music most of us are familiar with in modern western society uses the 12 TET (twelve-tone equal temperament) system. The reason for this is a somewhat complex mix of music theory, mathematics, and practical limitations that I'm not going to get into right now, but if you're interested, [this video](https://youtu.be/ZOLRvbPURXQ) provides a concise and digestible explanation of it. Microtonal music refers to the use of tuning systems that are not the 12 TET system; that is, music that splits the octave into more or less than 12 tones, in some way or another. Now, microtonal tunings have been used in non-western cultures for centuries, including Indian, Indonesian, Thai, Burmese, African, and Arabic music. However, this post is mainly about microtones in modern music, so I won't really dig into those cultures much either.  My exposure to microtonal music is deeper than many people, however it is still a pretty base level understanding. Although to be fair, microtonal music is still a relatively undeveloped field of music considering the nearly endless possibilities it opens up. The first microtonal music I came across that really grabbed my attention was the music of Sevish, specifically [this song](https://youtu.be/l9wINwlgxRU). The song is called ""Gleam"" and uses both 22 TET and and a 5/4 time signature. Which brings me to one of my favorite aspects of microtonal music. Many electronic microtonal songs are pushing the boundaries of music and are experimental in many ways. Many of Sevish's songs use unconventional time signatures that really compliment the alien and lopsided sounds of alternative tunings. [Starfish](https://youtu.be/Z0seAc_Snk4) is another great example of a song he made using a 5/4 time signature and 22edo (22edo and 22 TET mean essentially the same thing), and this time with the added layer of tempo changes used in a way I've never heard before. If you like the songs I've linked here, I highly recommend checking out the rest of his stuff. I personally view microtonal music as similar to jazz in the sense that both were quite unconventional when they first showed up. Jazz was hated by many initially (and still today by some people) because the harmonics and chord progressions used were just so *different* from what most music sounded like at the time. However, once you get past the initial shock of how *off* it sounds, you can start to appreciate it and enjoy it as something completely new and incredible. The same thing goes for microtonal music. Of course, computer technology is the main reason why microtonal music is able to be explored now, as opposed to earlier in music history, and why so much of it is electronic. It's not very practical to split the piano into 31 different notes per octave, after all. Although electronic music is not the only modern genre of music where microtones have been tried out in. Just recently I listened to *Flying Microtonal Banana* by King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, which is a psych-rock album made in 24 TET using special instruments that have the ability to play quarter tones, rather than just half tones. There's a lot out there I'm sure I haven't discovered as well. Anyway, that brings me to the end of my ramblings. There is plenty of microtonal music out there other than 22 TET and 24 TET, some of my favorites being 31 TET and 19 TET. Some questions I have for anybody reading this are: How familiar with microtonal music are you? Do you think we're just hitting the tip of the iceberg with it and if so, how do you think it will develop in 10 years? 20 years? 50 years? Lastly, do you think we'll ever see microtonal music branch further into the mainstream, or do you think it's too out there to ever get much more traction than it already has?",King Giz just dropped another microtonal lp https://open.spotify.com/album/6uuQKwM3fRETiscHqlnxuo?si=bb8HGMsvRCW_Hhqzq3gjMA,50
kq7zcz,"MF DOOM's legacy is a strange thing to reflect on. Despite being respected by every MC who listened to his records, the Villain's  fanbase never really evolved beyond a cult following. I can't think of many worse-marketed careers: the constant name changes, the general avoidance of hooks, the obtrusive beats, the impostors at the live shows... It's no wonder he always stayed in the shadows of hip-hop, quietly carving  out one of the most bizarre and impressive discographies the genre has produced. A genius who never wanted (or needed) the limelight. Was DOOM the greatest rapper of all time? I wouldn't say so... Skill is one thing, but soul is another. Biggie, Nas, Andre 3k, Eminem, Chuck D, Kanye West: all these rappers were very serious minded, using rhyme to convey a message and their humanity. But for DOOM, rhyme wasn't a means to an end: it was its own reward, the perfection of the craft being his only real objective. In the same way that the more technically-skilled Joe Satriani can't compete with Hendrix's guitar for depth of feeling, I would argue DOOM cannot match Biggie, Nas or Eminem in the GOAT rankings. This is not to say DOOM was without soul: his love of humour, performance and language shine through his raps- they give the music heart. English becomes DOOM's playground, and the listener becomes enthralled in just how far he can push the medium of rhyme. Because he never gave a damn about ""keeping it real"", he was free to create impossible fantasies where ""Freudian"" rhymes with ""accordion"", and ""super"" rhymes with ""duke her""/""trooper""/""King Koopa""/""TV blooper""/""D.B. Cooper"".  Every DOOM fan has their own favourite couplet, endlessly posted on forums- I'm still in awe of his opening to ""Guv'nor"":  ""Catch a throatful from the fire vocaled/ With ash and molten glass like Eyjafjallaj√∂kull"". In short, DOOM was about proving rap was *fun*, that the process itself was joyful, the perfect tonic to the materialistic, dead-end posturing of post-gangsta. For me, this is enough to put him in the top 5 MCs of all time, perhaps even top 3 (yeah, I know I'm contradicting myself). This love of the craft is, of course, why DOOM is so respected in the first place. His flow is the highest ranking in all of hip-hop, no contest; statistically, he has the [fifth-highest vocabulary](https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/index.html) (the GZA is the only major rapper who outranks him); no-one ties rhymes together quite so exquisitely. *Madvillainy* is the hip-hop nerd's bible, and every fan has that one DOOM album they swear is underrated (seriously, more people need to hear *The Mouse and the Mask*)*.* I'm hoping that his tragic death will force more listeners to acknowledge him not just as a great rapper, but as a great *artist*. He deserves a place in the history books alongside John Coltrane and Eric Clapton- virtuosos who pushed their craft to the absolute limit. RIP to MF DOOM, Zev Love X, King Geedorah, Viktor Vaughn, Metal Fingers and, most of all, Daniel Dumile. What are your guys thoughts on MF DOOM? A penny for your thoughts?","Kept to himself, didn‚Äôt want fame, wore a mask ffs, the most humble dude to do it who had his own struggles and a somewhat hard life, which makes him all the more relatable to the Everyman.

The best MC ever as espoused by many many great, still living musicians and will so be into the future. There is so much to say here and everyone will have their opinions, for the most part we should just keep listening to the music that he made and try and follow his example of heart and humanity.

kqt001,"I‚Äôm glad that post-hardcore happened. I like hardcore punk a lot, but post-hardcore is (IMO) one of the most interesting offshoots of punk. Post-hardcore took hardcore‚Äôs rage, drive and ethics into more complex territories, and it proved how hardcore could experiment with/move away from conventions.  Husker Du, the Minutemen and Big Black (along with other bands) started the post-hardcore thing in the 80s, and they (in addition to numerous artists) did so much for expanding hardcore‚Äôs musical vocabulary. Husker Du had a melodic take on hardcore, and Zen Arcade is a massive, ambitious adventure that has fear, joy, surrealism, anticipation, etc. New Day Rising has bright, gorgeous melodies, and the Minutemen were groovy and nimble. The Minutemen‚Äôs aesthetic was very different in comparison to regular hardcore; they favored great instrumentation, spiky guitar work, groovy basslines and odd time signatures, and Big Black had grinding, ear-splitting guitars. Fugazi, Drive Like Jehu, Unwound and Refused contributed a lot to post-hardcore, too; Fugazi‚Äôs early era incorporated angular, sharp guitars and basslines that took cues from dub and reggae. Drive Like Jehu has tricky guitar parts and complex structures, and Unwound used unusual guitar tunings. Refused had a *very* heavy approach, and At the Drive-In‚Äôs Relationship of Command has trippy bits. Gospel‚Äôs The Moon Is a Dead World is psychedelic and progressive.  Post-hardcore took cues from multiple places, too. Bob Mould talked about the Beatles, the Byrds and the Who, and he liked Unknown Pleasures. Bob Mould grew up on 60s pop, and Husker Du covered the Byrds‚Äô ‚ÄúEight Mikes High‚Äù. The Minutemen liked Wire, Gang of Four and the Pop Group, and D. Boon grew up with Creedence Clearwater Revival. Sonic Youth influenced Fugazi, and NEU! inspired Drive Like Jehu. Justin Trosper talked about John Coltrane and the Velvet Underground, and in general, post-hardcore can have post-punk, psychedelia, jazz, metal and noise rock. Post-hardcore took hardcore‚Äôs goals into intricate, unexpected places, and post-hardcore can have math rock, dissonance, funky bits, etc. Post-hardcore led to/inspired other genres, too, and it can have multiple emotions. Emo came from post-hardcore, and the Minutemen and NoMeansNo led to the development of math rock. Emo led to screamo and powerviolence, and post-hardcore has popped up in alternative metal. Post-hardcore encompassed the blinding, white-hot rage of Husker Du, the jazzy/funky fun of the Minutemen and the aggressive, harsh sounds of Big Black. Some of Unwound‚Äôs stuff is beautiful and melancholic, and Gospel‚Äôs The Moon Is a Dead World has very surreal/desperate parts. Fugazi‚Äôs early era has passion and integrity, and At the Drive-In favored an energetic approach with progressive structures and jagged guitars.","Probably my all-round favourite genre of music. The scope is huge but you just know that yearning sound when you hear it and the influences coming through. Fugazi, At the Drive In, Trail of Dead, Rites of Spring, Title Fight, Drive Like Jehu, Every Time I Die. You could include the likes of American Football or Slint even if you pushed it enough, even though musically they have basically nothing in common with hardcore.",64
kr8mhr,"I was watching a video about what some artists were saying about the Beatles. Amid all of the overwhelming flattery and praise was Lou Reed's comment that stuck out like a sore thumb. He calls the Beatles ""garbage"", saying that he never liked them. And that Lennon never did ""anything"" until his solo career. He eventually points out one song he likes by Lennon called ""Mother"" (good song, for sure, but to my ears, less impressive than prime Beatles stuff). Beatles fans in the comments were outraged.  With Lou Reed's case, it almost seems ""on brand"" for him to hate on the Beatles, as they were contemporaries, but seemingly made music with different sounds and intentions for commercial appeal (although I've heard many times that Lou Reed actually wanted to make hits a la Sunday Morning and that Cale was a major driving force behind their weirdness). While I find his comments interesting and generally inoffensive, I just thing he's wrong  and unnecessarily harsh. It's hard for me to listen to songs like Eleanor Rigby, Day in the Life etc. and hear ""garbage"". On the contrary, it sounds beautiful. At the very least, catchy and fun.  So I'm curious: what do you think when artists mouth of on other artists? What is the intention? I know it depends on particular scenarios, but should we just take it at face value that they just don't like that music, or is there more? Jealousy? Pretentiousness? Anger? Resentment?  Also, there are some artists who seem to put down other people's music A LOT. Lou Reed here, Thom Yorke used to do this a lot, the Gallagher brothers, Morrissey oftentimes etc.  Who are some others? I find the negatively kind of pointless. You don't like it... that's totally fine. But some seem to want to make a point out of it.","Sometimes people just don't like some music. It doesn't have to be malicious. Take Led Zeppelin for example. Pete Townshend, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Richards, Malcolm Young, Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker,  and other artists of the day all talk about Zeppelin's music being a bit shit. For some of those guys, that's not at all out of character, but a little more so for others.    I don't think it's jealousy, pretentiousness, anger, or resentment. I think they just thought Led Zeppelin was a bit shit.      With that said, it is also possible there is some angry in their statements. I can imagine it could be rather frustrating see something like that happen in real time. I guess worth noting that in this instance some of the complaints were more that just ""I don't like the way it sounds."".",251
ksf4mc,"(Not quite yet) happy 2021! Let's hope it gets better!  So, how does everyone listen to music? I was born in the 70s but came of age in the 80s, which means that I have always had fondness for vinyl but also listened to a lot of CDs and, in recent years, streaming audio. Through it all, I've collected and listened to vinyl for many reasons: I enjoy the active listening involved in selecting a record and placing it on a platter and playing it. I love the scale and creativity of the packaging. I like knowing that, very often, the artist was involved in most aspects of the design and creation of the product. And, honestly, I like living with a library of my favorite music. I love the physical thing and the physical motion of listening to records. However, if I am being honest, I am not an audiophile. In fact, I have impaired hearing in one ear. I enjoy the sound of vinyl and can discern some sound that I cannot hear on streaming services. And I think that subtle difference is a factor, but it is not THE factor. And, I must say that the portability of streaming services and the exploration of new music through smart algorithms is something I actually appreciate. Seeing where Spotify goes from The Kinks or Jonathan Richman or Pavement is interesting and pleasurable to me. Any thoughts or feelings on the matter?","Technically, uncompressed digital at even the unadventurous standard of CD audio (16-bit 44.1KHz) does outperform vinyl in accuracy. However, most streaming formats are a long way off even that ancient CD quality. Pleasurable is subjective. Here are my aguments for both options: Vinyl - the art of setting up the record player and amp, pulling out the vinyl, setting it on the turntable and dropping the needle is a great precursor for active listening. Vinyl takes a little time to experience and that preparation helps in the later appreciation of the music. Further, you're more likely to listen to an entire side rather than skipping as skipping requires you to carefully lift the needle and accurately drop it at  the start of the next track using the visual difference in the grooves of the vinyl to identify the small section of silence. Listening to the whole album in one sitting allows you to enjoy it as the artist intended, particularly on a concept album where a story is being told. Streaming - listen to what you want in what order you want. You don't need to own it, you can curate your own playlists, you can shuffle, and disappear down rabbit holes of related artists.",186
kt4l86,"Disclaimer: This is all based on my extremely biased opinion.  As a former Grimes super fan, her evolution as an artist and as a person has been deeply disappointing for me.  I discovered Grimes in 2012 on her KEXP session and was absolutely taken with her. I listened to Visions almost exclusively for about 3 months and revisited it for years after that. I also listened to Halfaxa, while less ‚Äúpop‚Äù I loved how weird and unconventional her sounds were.  I found art angels to be less inspired but still a few bangers with kill V maim and Venus Fly being the standout hits. I also enjoyed hearing her transition from a more alternative sound to genuine, interesting pop music.  However, I found Miss Anthropocene to be nearly unlistenable. I wanted to like it, I listened through the album several times but couldn‚Äôt find a single hook that spoke to me the way her older work does.  She has now catapulted herself into superstardom by dating an extremely famous person (which felt a little calculated to me). As a result she has abandoned all the philosophies that were once a cornerstone of who she was and the work she created.  Her interviews years ago were about her process and seemed very raw and intense, which was reflected her work. Now watching her interviews I get secondhand embarrassment by the way she talks about her life and work. To me this really seems like a classic selling out situation. She‚Äôs involved with a billionaire, locked in now that they have a child together, and is milking that fame for all its worth. Her art has suffered, she has clearly abandoned her personal values, though her career has launched into overdrive.  This is just my opinion, I was such a die hard Grimes fan so it really felt like I watched a hero in my life turn into a complacent bystander among global supervillains. But again just my opinion.","I'm not sure I believe anyone can sell out anymore. That being said, as someone who loved everything up to and including Visions and hated everything after, she definitely opted for being more of a pop musician at that point. I know I'm in the minority but I found her post-Visions output incredibly boring.  And yeah Elon Musk sucks, but I'm not sure how much impact that had on her music.",130
ktnyy4,"Ariel Pink is a top 5 all time artist for me. I genuinely think he is one of the best songwriters of the past 20 years and his albums like Doldrums, House Arrest, Before Today and Pom Pom are as good as (mostly) lo-fi music gets. I don't like to throw this term around too often, but in my eyes the man is a songwriting genius.  &nbsp; I'm sure many of you have heard by now, Ariel Pink was [inexplicably seen at a Trump rally and now dropped by his label](https://www.vulture.com/2021/01/ariel-pink-dropped-by-label-in-wake-of-trump-capitol-rally.html). People have been debating both sides of cancel culture and I have seen various arguments pop up about the ""dangers"" of exiling someone with an opposing political view. I see it as more of a grey area and view each situation differently as I imagine most people do. However, this is the first time in my life that I have been THIS disappointed in an artist that I love so much. I've always been a firm believer of separating the artist from the art and for the first time in my life I really felt like that was being put to the test. For context, I'm a massive fan of the Smiths and while I think Morrissey is a vile racist POS, [it still doesn't take away from the brilliant music](https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/06/nick-cave-morrissey/) him and Johnny Marr made some 30 odd years ago. For me anyway. &nbsp; So while initially being massively let down by an artist, who if I'm being honest has had a history of being a sketchy weirdo with some bat shit opinions, I decided to throw on some of his music for the first time since hearing the news. A funny thing happened. I was completely lost in bliss to the back to back songs I chose [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vIRJbzAjVA) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of13sCQVMQA0). All the disappointment with his Trump allegiance fell by the wayside and I could only hear the songs I have been infatuated with for well over a decade. Of course, once the music stopped and the euphoria wore off I was again reminded of his unfortunate personal choices. &nbsp; Many people have canceled him and swore to never support his music again. Totally fair. However, I also imagine a fair amount of people don't feel nearly as strongly about his output as I do. Not to say that there aren't massive Ariel Pinks fans out there who are now done with him for good. I reckon the majority of people either haven't heard of him, or thought he was ranging anywhere from crap to good, but certainly not worth the trouble of supporting someone whose ideology is so different from their own. Had this been an artist I was only lukewarm about I don't think I would have any hesitation with moving on from them for good, although I rarely do that since I always try to separate the artist from the art. I understand that not everyone is comfortable with that. &nbsp; What I learned from this experience is that when you have such a strong emotional connection to an artist, the leash you give them is obviously so much greater which leads to the discussion of fans tending to put their heroes on a pedestal while trying to ignore their flaws. John Lennon did some terrible things to his first wife, Bowie slept with a very underage girl, Jimmy Page even more so.  More recently celebrated musicians like Mac DeMarco seem to have been able to avoid being blacklisted [despite exhibiting some very shady behavior](http://archive.is/iURtf).  &nbsp; I've had people tell me that there is so much music out there, that it shouldn't be too hard to find something else to replace Ariel Pink with. However, replacing a personal top 5 artist is very difficult. I've had some of my favorite musical moments with an artist who has been a big part of me for 10+ years that it is very tough to simply move on and erase. Now obviously everyone has a line, and for many this Trump incident for Ariel has gone too far. I'm coming to the realization that the greater the artist, the harder it can be for them to fall in your eyes. That leash of what they get away with becomes bigger. It's easier to hate on Kid Rock for being a misogynistic douchebag than it is Lou Reed for doing the same. I know I'm not saying anything too profound or new in this post, but I would love to hear about other people's experiences with coming to terms with a problematic artist they held dear to them. I reckon some may continue to listen to the music, but refuse to support the artist financially. If you had a similar experience, how did it effect you?","fucking clusterfuck read and weep, all ye latecomers",182
kudbh1,"  Lately, I have been questioning and contemplating for a while about where the music scene worldwide will go in the post-COVID world. In recent years and last year, the world have been witnessing a disco-revival, domination of K-POP music and the continued domination of rap and hip-hop music. Currently, with artists like The Weeknd, Drake, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, BTS and Justin Bieber and a number of other artists dominating the music scene, I'm very excited and eagered to know your opinions and possible predictions about the future directions of the music landscape.  I'm extremely intrigued and cannot wait for lockdowns to be lifted, clubs and bars to be re-opened, live concert tours to be back and see what will actually happen to the world, society and especially the music world.  Comment the genres, music and types of genres that you think will take the lead in the post-COVID world. You can go deeper into predictions for music trends in America, Latin America, Europe and Asia if you are interested to!  P.s. As the nostalgia game has been extremely strong in the past few years. What trend do you see returning? And will it be in the new form or the original form.","I think it's going to be really difficult for mid-tier acts to tour. Here in America there have been a dozen notable venue closures already, there'll probably be more before everything is back up and running. Add to that, talent agents - the people who book tours and work out logistics - were let go pretty much immediately at the start of lockdown. Those jobs will probably come back to a degree but not to the size they were pre-COVID. So smaller acts don't have booking agents and have less places to play. I think there will be plenty of live music, *a lot* now that everyone has been deprived of it for so long. Legacy acts playing huge arenas owned by AEG or LiveNation will do crazy sales. Local bars with local acts will do fine because there will be demand for anyone to play a song. People in between those two poles are going to have a tougher time. The infrastructure for those acts has taken a huge hit.",193
kv0tqu,"I'm on a bit of a slowthai bender right now. He's so refreshing in how he's clearly and (very punk-ishly) cursing down the British establishment, opening up conversations about the class gap, and more. This guy is truly one to watch - unfortunately, pretty much underrated in places that aren't hiphop centered, music critique, or British.  In the past, we had outfits like RatM directly challenging the state through astute lyricism. This continued even in the naughts with Green Day's American Idiot, for example - the ills of society, authoritarianism, and more were *absolutely* addressed in lyrics and not just hinted at with themes. They were the centerpiece of many songs; Bulls on Parade, American Idiot come to mind. And not without good reason: these albums and songs become and remain mainstream hits, with their overarching political statements being often a non-negotiable part of these bands' popularity and artistry.  Many of our current biggest popstars are vocal about socio-political issues, but stray away from penning any true political lyrics - for ""good reasons"" I guess, aka pandering to corporate overlords and optics. I guess virtue signalling can also be part of this conversation, but I digress. When will music, if ever, return to a more bonafide connection between people and artist, addressing directly issues that affect the kid listening to Nothing Great about Britain through his laptop speakers? Will the current political revolutions on the grounds of so many of our countries finally reflect artistic pursuits in the same way that way of life and entertainment were so keenly connected a few decades ago? Let's discuss!","Political music never left. I'd wager in terms of volume we have more of it in 2021 than we ever have.  Just this past year, we have Run the Jewel's 4, which is exceedingly political.  Now, if you're asking something like ""will political music make consistent radio play in 2021"" I'd say no. But that has more to do with the decentralization of popular music than anything.",123

However, in America they seem to be losing steam.  Still, I think the predictions that CDs will be extinct are kinda exaggerated.  I haven't seen much signs of CDs becoming non-existent this year.  There still are CD albums being printed by the likes of small companies like LaLaLand, Intrada, and some others.  I'm sure there will still be a niche for those people.","Totally agree. I thought I'd be fine with just having digital albums, but I recently shelved my CD collection, and it just made me sad that I didn't have more.

kw2gvl,"When looking into a community relating to a specific instrument, you will hear the same names. Drummer communities have Buddy Rich, Neil Peart, John Bonham, maybe Gene Krupa but these are the main people you hear about. All of these guys proficient a phew you may describe as ‚Äúgenius‚Äù but, why the fuck do I have hear about these guys talked about as gods every time they are posted on drum forums?  These drummers were important in a lot of ways but why is everyone else overlooked or worse yet, people compare them to more modern drummers as a way of putting them down.  That last point is interesting because it shows how hero worship stems from insecurity, if you worship these guys who were great you gain said greatness (without acknowledging that they worked hard for their skill). It becomes this excuse to not try as hard at your craft, then when you inevitably hit a wall in your skill they simply resort to the excuse of ‚Äúthey were born that way‚Äù or ‚Äúnobody else can do what they did‚Äù. Understanding basic techniques or rhythmic vocabulary is some giga brain feat to pull off, that could lead to becoming a rip off of the artist, but it‚Äôs your job to find your own path to expound upon the things they set up. But when nobody puts effort towards analysis, stupid shit just gets past around. I‚Äôve read that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt even know how Rich did what he did‚Äù which is utter bullshit, they‚Äôre hundreds of videos explaining his techniques (which, like most hand, techniques aren‚Äôt even that complicated), not to mention his music wasn‚Äôt that interesting to listen since it‚Äôs most rudiments played at high speed. My point being that when we don‚Äôt take the time to analyze and humanize these musicians, it makes it hard to talk about music technically. This whole attitude has really gotten on my nerves and I was curious what other people thought about this?","You‚Äôre just tilting at windmills man. You‚Äôre displaying a very common attitude amongst people these days, the idea the a statement that is obviously an opinion is stated without the expressed qualifier of ‚Äúin my opinion‚Äù somehow becomes an offense. Personally I am more annoyed by people who take things like that so seriously. In essence you are demanding people speak in a way that makes YOU feel comfortable about yourself and your beliefs or ideas. It‚Äôs so regressive and petulant. Just because some artists will forever be held up as gods of their craft doesn‚Äôt mean innovation is dead. Stop worrying about devotion to artists and how people express themselves and worry more about your own musical path.",195
kwjn08,"This is something that's been kicking around my head for a while. I'm a frequent RYM user, and I was looking over the albums I've rated 4.5 or 5 (out of 5). Some of these I find that I've rated in the past year or two, and then seldom listened to again. I stand by my rating of these, I think they're absolutely perfect or near-perfect records. However, I still don't really have the urge to come back and hear it again.  Conversely, I have many in the 3/3.5/4 out of 5 range that I find myself listening to weekly or daily.  It's not always this way. There are obviously some albums I consider perfect that I listen to a lot, but it's nowhere near universal.  Do you fine people see a similar trend in your listening? I recognize this is absolutely naval gazing and incredibly unimportant in the grand scheme of music. I just found it interesting that there's such a wide divide between the things I find to be the best vs. the things I find to be the most enjoyable.","I think sometimes with music that I think of as ""really good"" I feel obligated to make a ritual out of listening to it and be very active and appreciative when listening to it.

kxiawa,"I‚Äôm a teenager and I only really got into music about two or so years ago, so I‚Äôve had streaming the whole time. If I want to discover new music, I just look up something that‚Äôs been suggested and hit play. I can‚Äôt imagine having to buy every vinyl, CD, or even digital download. You could go purchase something and just not like it at all, so it would just be money going down the drain. Before streaming, were there even music nerds that know every classic album and underground genre like there are today? It just doesn‚Äôt seem possible financially.","In the late sixties and seventies FM radio was what you would listen to if your were into music beyond the charts. They would play full albums, broadcast live shows, pull out some deep record you never would have heard of and played it. These DJs and curators were on air well into dawn. This was how you could supplement whatever record or tape collection you had and hear a great deal of different kinds of music you weren‚Äôt like to find on the shelves. Especially if you lived in a place without a real record store. Most records were sold in department stores and would only carry the titles and artists that would be most likely to sell. FM radio was where you went if you were a music nerd. Edit: I would like to add that music publications, such as Melody Maker, Rolling Stone, Creem and others were essential for genre classification, album reviews and best of lists. Robert Christgau was a very influential voice at the time with his weekly reviews of albums, and as the years went on, his numerical classification of albums. He and many other music critics of the day were vitally important in knowing which record to buy to ensure your money indeed didn‚Äôt go down the drain. Though as someone else on the thread here said, if you bought an album you made sure you found *something* about it you liked",402
ky8yk1,"I'm sure every music fan in this sub struggles to some degree keeping up with new music with the absolute hordes of releases that drop every week nowadays, but for me it's actually started to negatively affect my enjoyment of music as a whole. Over the last year I've ended up looking at the ""New Releases"" page of sites like Album of the Year as a challenge, even though the logical side of my brain knows I can't possibly keep up with the thousands upon thousands of releases that come in any given year (and sorry to all the ""underground"" artists I listened to last year, but I found that much of it was unknown for a reason... lol).  This completionism led to a phenomenon where despite listening to a massive amount of records last year, I only came away with a handful that I actually made the time to listen to enough times to really love and appreciate them. I'm left to wonder how many albums I could've formed a deeper connection with last year had I not instead spent my time listening to some random crap that wasn't worth the time at all. To combat this issue, I've decided to try limiting myself to 5 new albums a week, each of which I would listen to at least 2-3 times to really form an opinion on it. Another benefit of this would be time opened up to dive into some classic records, since I'm still pretty uneducated on music history as a fan who has yet to enter his 20th year. I'm sure I'll feel some FOMO about the ""underground gems"" that I'm missing out on since I'll likely keep it to albums that are getting both positive and significant buzz, but my hope is that if something from the depths is truly special I'll hear about it through one of my music discovery channels and put it on my weekly list. I'd like to know all of y'alls thoughts on this though. Has anyone had a similar issue? Do you think my solution is a good one? I feel like it seems kind of rigid and restrictive, but I think it's time I do something to start prioritizing quality over quantity, ya know?","There are sites you can connect your lastfm, spotify or apple music to and they notify you every time an artist you listen to releases new music.  I agree that it's hard to keep up with the new music because there's new releases every single week.

kywzb6,"**Well, how do you discover music?** It is well known that being a self-professed music nerd was harder in ye olden days, as crate digging, radio and parties, although more involved and arguably more rewarding, were definitely more difficult than loading up a streaming service. Cassette trading in the 90s, and later in the 90s and early 00s Usenet groups and file sharing forums were also popular. &#x200B; I've always been the one to take a more ''structured'' approach to listening to music. This meaning my sources of music are forums (Facebook music groups, the music sphere of discord, subreddits like this one), youtube channels (such as theneedledrop, [deep cuts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYhCg0DHloE9gn-PAiAYNg)..) and charts ([like this one](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/706528753018470480/798633632826392596/Mucore_template.jpg)) to satisfy my music discovery needs.  Keep in mind that this does not necessarily mean discovery of *new* music meaning released recently by unknown artists - in my case this rather means discovering genres and classics that already exist.  Lots of my friends discover music more organically - through recommendations by their friends, music played at house parties, youtube algorithm leading them onto new stuff (Looking at you, [Molchat Doma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crz1PpKk3dU&ab_channel=MolchatDoma) and [Plastic Love](https://youtu.be/3bNITQR4Uso)) Other acquaintances are more dedicated, trodging through the new bands on Bandcamp and selecting who to support. To end the body of the post, I'd like to mention some youtube channels that can solicit some music discovery (disclaimer: I have no affiliation with any of these channels!) [MyAnalogJournal](https://www.youtube.com/user/zagorofficial) \- a really amazing channel that plays mixes of music generally extremely underrepresented in the music discussion spheres I frequent. Examples include [Peruvian Cumbia](https://youtu.be/6GwdWSx8v0c), [Congolese Rumba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0YaT-OqGZs), [Oud playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzfGJSOKXag), Yugoslav jazz, and lots and lots of other international mixes and genres that could really use more attention. [Dronemf S.](https://www.youtube.com/user/Dronemf11/videos) \- great channel posting music from most likely forgotten tapes and records from mainly Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe. You can find anything ranging from experimental music, noise, [orthodox christian gothwave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60TnV2Uf5xA), darkwave, punk...  [Harakiri Diat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFKg7hJdIitGtq4B-nxW0eQ) \- self-proclaimed tastemaker channel that boasts an eclectic mix of (new!) stuff from underground artists on Bandcamp labels. Here you can find the most modern stuff, so setting genre labels is difficult - there's a loth of experimentation going on on this channel, and most of this stuff is unknown. And now for two websites: [http://everynoise.com/](http://everynoise.com/) \- Website that plots 5000+ genres uploaded to Spotify along a few vague axes (left- dense and atmospheric, right - spikier and bouncier, up - mechanical and electric, down - organic). This site is amazing, yet extremely overwhelming as you get a huge chunk of all digitized music mapped and thrown at you. &#x200B; [http://radio.garden/](http://radio.garden/) \- Tune in to thousands of worldwide live radio stations on an interactive globe. &#x200B; With the points laid down and a few music discovery channels lined up (and lots of links) , I'd like to ask some questions to foster discussion: How do you discover music? Do you have an interest in discovering music that is outside the same few hundred artists that are always discussed in these music discussion spheres? If so, how do you do it? What do you think of music discovery today? How does it compare to earlier times? Do you have any interesting places to discover new music?   How much new music do you listen to compared to the music you already know? What do you think about the stuff I've linked? Do you take a more structured approach, or do you let music come and go organically?","My approach to finding new artists isn‚Äôt really structured or planned out in any way. If I hear an artist that I like, I‚Äôll take the time to listen to some of their records. If I really like the artist/genre I‚Äôll look into some of said artists influences or any bands in the same genre/timeframe. That‚Äôs how I discovered The Smiths, my favorite band, through Radiohead. While listening to The Smiths I then branched out into other new wave bands like Devo, The Cure, The Romantics, and Talking Heads, as well as some of Morrissey‚Äôs influences like David Bowie, T Rex, and The New York Dolls.

kzdnk4,"It's funny which musician's deaths hit you. I suppose this one in particular gets me down because it emphasises the fragility of the Dolls' legacy. With the exception of frontman David Johansen, all original members are now gone. And with their legacy never blossoming the way of fellow commercial failures Ramones and the Velvet Underground, they're a step closer to disappearing into history's ether. When Spotify shows you've got less than half as many listeners as The Replacements, things aren't looking good.  This doesn't change the fact that the Dolls were a seminal, prophetic and wildly influential band. And you can hear Sylvain's motoring guitar driving both their debut and its even more underrated sequel. Johnny Thunders was a genius, but his anarchic lead needed a platform to jump from: Syl gave him that. RIP.

l1bn4n,"I've been thinking that over the past year, I dove straight into Nine Inch Nails pretty heavily since I needed something to vent my 2020 sentiments. Even though I'd listened to them years ago (really only discovered who they were through Quake, even though I had heard Trent's work on movies or the Black Ops II theme), nothing really ever clicked for me until I began diving deeper into their stuff throughout a shit year. I found that NIN resonated me on an emotional level, and though I love the heaviest, most-abrasive stuff when I absolutely need it, there's something beautiful about the more somber tracks to help me reflect (stuff on the *Still* album or *Ghosts V*). I wasn't sure what to think of NIN initially and found songs in my Spotify library that were clearly cherry picked when I first listened to them, but between *The Downward Spiral* and *The Fragile* (maybe *Year Zero* too), those albums in their entirety really helped me get through some lows. To me I realized for the first time that music never really reached that high of an emotional peak before. I honestly didn't think NIN would become my favourite band period, and the fact that it took first place before favourite bands I've listened to for far longer (like Queens of the Stone Age for the past decade) speaks volume on their impact on me.  After that I began seeking out everything about them, watching concerts online, reading up history about Trent and NIN, buying merch, consuming every piece of music that there was and ultimately just solidifying that this was my favourite band. Even though my time with all of NIN was shorter, I think it's safe to say this takes the #1 spot easily on my list of favourite bands/artists. Not only this, but I have to thank NIN for getting me used to more abstract/abrasive sounds, and again (similar to how I got into NIN) I started listening to Radiohead's other albums recently and *Amnesiac* really clicked for me on the first listen as it reminded me of *Hesitation Marks*; an album that's underappreciated and similar in sound, plus I'm nostalgic towards it now since it planted the NIN seed that bloomed last year. I've heard *Amnesiac* and *Kid A* don't click on first listen, but there's something special about it to me when it did because it was a gratifyingly cohesive jump as a NIN fan.  So I guess I could thank NIN for getting me into Radiohead's more weird electronic pieces and Muse because that's how I discovered Radiohead ironically. There seems to be a lot of cross pollination between my favourite artists to the point where I begin valuing eachothers underappreciated works, or coming across obscure stuff like [*Mantra*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaF5U6AmlU) (wish those 3 would collab on a whole album)*.* I was recently relistening to Matt Bellamy's [*Tomorrow's World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-IlcrDrw4) and I loved how much it gave me Radiohead despite it feeling like a lyrically weaker version of [*Pyramid Song*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Agt3XfmccM), and the same goes for a lot of Muses' slower songs that I began to appreciate more **because** of Radiohead. [*Ruled by Secrecy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKiayHSR4DI) sounds alot like [*Everything In Its Right Place*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUnXxh5U25Y) and I just love the similar beats of the both even if others might use that as fuel for the Muse-is-Radiohead argument (unironically). Even though QOTSA isn't my first all-time favourite like it was when it was all I listened to in my first few years of high school, I have a huge soft spot for them because it's the band that got me into music discovery outside of pop radio tunes. I also jumped back into Fall Out Boy's *Folie a Deux* a lot last year because it hit the right emotions at the right time in my life, and ended up finding a new appreciation for the evolved sound after listening to it so frequently (same could be said for Paramore's *After Laughter or* QOTSA *Like...Clockwork*). Boldly reworking or cohesively evolving your music is something I didn't really *get* or understand until hearing all of NIN or Radiohead who have really mastered their art, but now I admire it when bands get me to come back because of their maturing library of sounds that I can listen to in order. I know for me there are plenty of artists that I've thought could be a favourite band/artist contendor, but usually songs gets relegated into my main playlist without much thought other than *""I like listening to it but I won't go out of my way to learn more about them or see what else they have to offer""*. Sometimes I even come back when a band I tried to get into releases a new album and wonder how they even captivated me in the first place. I have a playlist to hear all my radio pop tunes from my childhood, but it's never my go to besides channeling moments of brief nostalgia, or annoyance with songs like *Soulja Boy Tell'em*. Fall Out Boy is my go-to nostalgia music from high school that I end up listening to them **a lot** subconsciously (based on my Spotify stats), whereas Queens of the Stone Age still remains as my go-to gap filler when I don't want anything new to listen to and need to rediscover their sounds before venturing to find new stuff (their music feels like the home that'll always be there when I need it). There are a lot of bands I used to convince myself they'd become a favourite only for me to give up on getting invested because of a lack of variety or just because doesn't channel emotional resonance. At the end of the day it's always my favourites I can come back to because I know how familiar the sound and lyrics are alongside who they are as artists, or they naturally grow emotionally with you. So I'm wondering defines a favourite for you? Is it the soundscape? Is it the artists themselves? I know a lot of people use nostalgia for one, but is there any emotional connection to the music that makes the music for you to have it as your own favourite? Do you go through phases of discovery before things eventually click? Do the bands/artists help you discover other bands that end up on your favourites list? Do you come back to them a lot? Are there qualifications you have before something can be your favourite? Do you remember menial things like all of their albums titles in chronological order lol? (I know I do).","I‚Äôve had a handful throughout the years, but it comes down to what do I keep coming back to that seems to consistently hit the spot; never sounds dated or uninteresting. It‚Äôs usually a 5+ year thing. My top-tier favorites have been so for 20-25 years. Their catalogues deeply explored and processed. I tend to look into their inspirations and side projects. Acquire band merch and gravitate towards certain band members, if it‚Äôs a band instead of solo artist. I have my objective ‚Äúbest‚Äù opinions on personal favorite albums/songs and what I think new listeners should start with, but what I like to hear is always changing. There‚Äôs always situational and seasonal associations that influence listening quite a bit. I‚Äôll also take breaks, intentional and not. Somehow I always find myself going back to the favorites I‚Äôve had since my teens up until recent years.  Stereolab has always been at the top with Cocteau Twins following closely. Edit:  spelling solo vs Apollo",96
l21lmo,"This is a thought I had listening to a few bands today that are very much revivalists.  Durand Jones & The Indications are one such band. They make music that owes a lot to classic soul music, mo-town, classic RnB. And while they have some great tunes, I certainly wouldn't say they reach the same heights as a Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, Ray Charles for example.  It is a similar thing with Leon Bridges. He makes great music, but perhaps doesn't reach the same heights as many of the Genre's classic.  I find I am more interested in RnB music that likes to add some experimentation to the Genre, like a Frank Ocean or Blood Orange; even though there is still a lot to love about revivalists like Leon Bridges and Durand Jones.  __________________ ... But this got me thinking, are there instances where revivalists can be as good or reach the same heights as their influences?  This is a very subjective question, so I imagine there will be a lot of different perspectives on it. _____________________ The best example I can think of is with 60s/70s psychedelia revivalism, neo-psychadelia. There seems to be cycles where this genre regains footing in the underground. Weather it be Bands like The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Flaming Lips, Wooden Shjips, Spacemen 3, Spiritualized and even Tame Impala and King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, there seems to be musicians of every generation that go back to pillage influences from the psychedelic bands of the 60s and early 70s. Sometimes entire scenes are created from a 60s revival, like the Elephant 6 bands in Athens Georgia that included the likes of Neutral Milk Hotel, Of Montreal, Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control and so on.  These bands wear their influences on their sleeves proudly, and fully indulge in genre tropes.  Many of these bands can get quite popular as with Tame Impala and The Flaming Lips; although we will probably never see any of these bands get as big as The Beatles or The Beach Boys were.  We see some records like this become very influential and gain cult classic status like Neutral Milk Hotel's Aeroplane album, but will it ever be as influential as Velvet Underground or Lou Reed Albums? Likely not. But many of these bands put out records that can truly measure up in terms of quality. At least to my ears.   ______________________________ What are some other examples that you can think of? Which genre revivals do you enjoy the most? Which ones do you find too derivative?","I think to answer this question fairly, we have to look through the lens of history, rather than at current bands which, by virtue of being current, affect our perception.  Led Zepplin, Cream, etc? They were copying the blues masters, then they discovered something and their music became its own thing.  The Beatles were a cover band playing German pubs.     To me, as a musician, or as any type of artist, I think the desire to be new is more damaging than the desire to copy.  I am right now working on building my repertoire as a musician.  I am learning classical guitar in the style of classical guitar. I am learning jazz in the style of jazz. I am learning rock, blues, soul, country, flamenco, Hell, I'm learning Disney covers (which I've seen seem to get good audience response) because I want to go play restaurants and bars and build hours as a performer.      I had a philosophy/magic teacher once who said that the major problem affecting most magicians and philosophers is that they believe they are not affected by their history and the culture they were raised in. They're modern, self-guided, and have shucked those things off.  Because of this, they are blind to the affect it has on them, and often, on digging, can't understand why they are driven to do certain things.  He posits that only by digging into our cultural history are we really empowered to recognize and then control how it affects our own actions.      I think this is especially true in art, and the more we learn from the masters, and understand their processes, and what affected them, and how they were shaped by the forces around them, that we get real control over our own artistic process.     All art is derivative, be it from other artists, or from nature and the world we live in.  To me, knowing what my influences are, REALLY knowing them, is vital.",69
l2olpx,"I get peeved by the instant tributes after a musician dies, thinking they could have enjoyed the accolades a few days earlier.  But I have never expressed to a band that I like them, other than by purchasing albums or going to a concert. How do you show or tell a band that you like them? How do (established & famous) bands want to receive our affection?   A letter?  Financial support?  Wearing a homemade t-shirt with their name on it around town?  Or maybe they don't need it at all, and I should leave them alone?","Depends on the size of the artist, tbh. If it's a huge artist (for the sake of conversation let's say, Paul McCartney), I'm not sure there's a thing that you, an individual, can do, that would show appreciation in a way that would matter. And that's not to say he's a dick or anything, he's just been told he's awesome every day for almost 60 years.  The smaller you get the more it makes sense. Then there are really three things that (in my experience) actually matter. Buying shit (which is a catchall for making a financial contribution to the artist), sending praise, and getting other people into them. If they're really small all of these things go a long way, because it really just helps move them forward towards being a professional full-time musician. In some cases, if they're really really small they might have never gotten paid or been praised by a stranger for their music, and in my experience, it always blows their mind.   Two anecdotes that always stick out in my mind:  1. There was a band I found on the old B9 Board (which was a web forum for fans of hardcore punk music, run by the record label B9) called Flawless. I thought they ruled, so I found their Bandcamp and paid $5 for their EP. It was one of those ""pay what you want"" releases. Someone in the band stalked me through my username, found my Last.fm, and sent me a thank you message there. It was very obvious this meant a whole lot to them.  2. I was at a show in Philly at a spot called The Barbary. I want to say I saw a show that was like, None More Black Man Overboard, and Gypsy. I saw this guy in the crowd that I recognized from a show a few days/weeks prior (Touche Amore and Trunks & Tails, I think?, this was 10 years ago now). I never caught the name of his band so I just went up and told him their set ruled and could he give me a link to the band or something. We chatted for a minute, he said the name of the band was something like ""Very Magic"" or ""Like Magic"" or something. I never did find a website for their stuff, but I could tell he was moved by a random stranger coming up and saying that their music ruled even though their set was in front of like 20 people.  Sorry, this got long winded fast. I guess just coming from a DIY scene where literally everyone you listen to is relatively accessible I had a lot of these experiences.",136
l32t52,"Think about it.  Both artists have massive discographies that are almost completely devoid of quality, and yet have amassed large followings of fans that act by a unique code of conduct while at their shows.  Both Jimmy Buffett and ICP have a ""quantity over quality"" approach to their music and both are willing to throw any asinine thought they have into a song.  Both groups embrace being tacky (albeit in different ways) over anything else. In conclusion, if you know a boomer who is into Jimmy Buffett, it's not that much of a stretch to imagine them as a juggalo had they been born 20 years later.","I wouldn‚Äôt say that Jimmy Buffet‚Äôs catalog is completely devoid of quality music.

l35k30,"The Ramones are a band that I‚Äôve always liked, but recently, I‚Äôve *really* gotten into them. Their first four albums are pivotal parts of punk, and I admire their style.  Frankly, I love their simplicity! The Ramones (circa their debut to Road to Ruin) didn‚Äôt use super-complex compositions, and they used barre chords & downstrokes. The rhythm section wasn‚Äôt flashy, and the Ramones were a stripped down band. However, I love all of that! I like how the Ramones had a ‚Äúto the point, no BS‚Äù style; their songs were over in 2-3 minutes or less, and they didn‚Äôt waste your time. The Ramones did a direct, straightforward interpretation of rock that I love. I admire how the Ramones were bare-bones in many ways, along with the lack of guitar solos and how they focused on making fast-paced songs.  The Ramones were melodic, too! Sure, they‚Äôre one of the pioneers of punk, but they were catchy! Their first four albums have tons of hooks & melodies, and the Ramones did pop tunes that were fast, raw & covered in distortion. The Ramones never forgot about melody, and there were sweet elements underneath the roughness. The melodies are excellent, too; memorable, distinctive & incredibly yummy.  The Ramones are charming, as well. The lyrics are simple, and they didn‚Äôt deal with super-deep stuff; the Ramones‚Äô aesthetic consisted of a constant sugar rush. Their first four albums never came off as cheesy to me; there was humor, irony & an endearing quality that brought another layer to their music. The Ramones sounded like they had a lot of fun, and even though a bunch of their songs followed a formula, there was a magic to the execution that kept their first four albums from getting tired.  As a side note, I‚Äôm astounded by the impact of the Ramones. Saying that they defined punk is an understatement; their impact on that genre is *huge*, and I‚Äôm sure their first four albums set a template that was expanded upon by many musicians. The Ramones paved the way for hardcore punk and thrash metal, and you could say that they inspired pop punk. Even parts of post-punk, post-hardcore and noise rock were inspired by the Ramones; just look into Wire, Big Black, John Reis, Bob Mould, Sonic Youth, etc.  Kevin Shields liked the Ramones, too; Johnny Ramone impacted him, and Kevin Shields admitted that for him, the Ramones were THE revelation. O.o","The Ramones‚Äô legacy will never be measured in the total number of records sold. Instead, you have to look at how many bands and solo artists they influenced. Far too many to list here, but from U2 to Green Day (and all of the popular and not-so-popular bands in-between), there isn‚Äôt a modern day rock/punk rock band that can‚Äôt thank The Ramones for paving the way. Hell, they even inspired a look and fashion that lives on in rock and punk rock circles over 45 years later. And if a band‚Äôs success just happens to be defined by how many of their t-shirts are sold to teens at shopping malls across the world, then The Ramones are arguably the most successful band in the history of bands whose name, sound and image have been appropriated by mainstream culture. Bonus: They even star in their own cult classic film.  Was every Ramones album a winner? No. They had a couple of duds. But even the bad albums are fun to listen to, and listeners are guaranteed at least one or two head-bopping, bubblegum chewing punk rock anthems.  So ‚ÄúGabba Gabba Hey!‚Äù to The Ramones, ya cretins.",52
l43at3,"I was listening to the album Discovery by Daft Punk, one of my all time favorites, and was thinking about how some of the songs are just a repeated little snippet over and over again for 3-4 minutes with the same lyric repeated for the entire song ([superheroes](https://youtu.be/UBGfS7S9BYg) is an example of this). However, I don't find myself getting sick of the song or annoyed with it so I wonder what makes the repetition in this song work. An example of repetition where I find it incredibly annoying would be [The Rockafeller Skank](https://youtu.be/nmsTwQb1csc) by fatboy slim (seen in the late 90s classic, She's all that). I cannot stand this song, it is so bad.  So I wonder, what is it about Daft Punk (this is just the example I've chosen, it's not the only example of good repetition in music) that makes repetition sound good compared to the rockafeller skank that makes a 4 minute song seem like an eternity?","In the example of Daft Punk with Superheroes, yes the song is extremely repetitive, but you have to also look at all the parts that come in and out over the course of the song.  It starts with the very simple drum beat before the main vocal line fades in. At the same time they are playing an almost muted version of the main beat before it is switched on. And they slowly keep fading in more instruments every 15-30 seconds or so.  Then drums drop out before coming back in pounding for this triumphant sound and then the key line hits and that really grabs your attention.  The song although repetitive is constantly changing and evolving which is what is keeping your attention heightened.  This is how pretty much every great repetitive song works. Think Since I Left You by the Avalanches or even All My Friends by LCD Soundsystem.   Now in opposition look at some of the songs on Human After All. That album is a far more minimalist and industrial album and some of the songs will be harder to get through. Or a band like Suicide. Their songs are pretty much just drum and key loops especially on the first two albums which turns a lot people away because they get bored.  Now dream baby dream is one of my favorite songs but to someone looking for new music I can see how it would lose their attention after the first minute. In summary some repetitive music keeps your attention easier because of how lush and over arching it is, as opposed to songs that never change and have a greater chance of you losing interest fast",159
l4jise,"I just wanted to walk through the connections between the ""Post-"" genres. (If you want me to get to the point, jump to paragraph 5, starting with ""But getting to the point"") Post-Punk was the first, obviously. The Post-Punk bands saw that punk cleaned the slate for what rock could be, and they decided to start building from there, inverting the expectations for rock music. But they weren't actually starting from zero. In the mid 1960s, The Velvet Underground saw that rock was basically considered kid's music, so they wanted to make ""rock for grown ups,"" basically, incorporating John Cale's noisy, avant-garde cello and Lou Reed's dark street poetry. Psychedelia also pushed rock into avant-garde territory, especially Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, which tackled things like surrealism and mental illness while doing psychedelic jams that were more radical than anything San Francisco hippies like the Jefferson Airplane or the Grateful Dead were doing at the time. The Stooges were of similar mind, combining free jazz, psychedelia, and an extremely primitive, aggressive take on the blues. In a way punk was a rebellion against the early 70s artsy prog bands like Yes and ELP, but punk was actually very influenced by the avant-garde art rock bands of the era. Glam bands like Roxy Music are obvious, but the most important influence on the Post-Punk bands was probably the German art rock scene, dubbed by foreign journalists as ""krautrock,"" a frankly ridiculous name I'm surprised people still use. But anyway, these German bands were rebelling against old German ideas about purity and traditionalism by pushing rock into the most extreme avant-garde territory possible, and they still haven't really been topped. Bands like Can, Faust, Neu!, and many others are key influences on post-punk, industrial music, post-rock, and shoegaze, and just about everything else experimental that's happened in popular music for the last 50 years. Joy Division often gets credited with basically starting Post-Punk, and IMO it's deserved. Frankly, most Post-Punk bands still sound a lot like Joy Division, with the dominant bass, chiming guitars, mechanical-sounding drums, emotive vocals, and spacious production. But there are post-punk bands that predate Joy Division. How can Joy Division have started the genre, while not being the first? From the beginning punk had avant-garde-minded bands like Television, Richard Hell & The Voidoids, Pere Ubu, and Wire. It's only later that those bands were retroactively labeled post-punk, because they were so much more experimental than what most people consider punk. These labels get confusing, since bands like Television, Pere Ubu, and Suicide can also be considered proto-punk, since they were some of the bands that helped start the entire punk movement. There's actually a subgenre that predates Joy Division that went farther than they ever did, no wave, with artists like DNA, James Chance, and ex-Richard Hell fianc√©e Lizzy Mercier Descloux. The no wave scene totally informed bands like Sonic Youth and Swans, and by extension all of noise rock. Composer Glenn Branca, who got his start in no wave band Theoretical Girls, was also a key influence on post-rock. But getting to the point, the post-hardcore bands were fully aware of how post-punk had moved on from the original punk movement. They basically had the exact same reaction to hardcore that the post-punk bands had to punk - they didn't want to be boxed in by the confines of the original genre. The very first post-hardcore bands were people involved in the hardcore scene, who were also alienated by it. Some would say the first post-hardcore bands were H√ºsker D√º and the Minutemen. Hardcore tended to be very scene-centric, so from the get-go H√ºsker D√º were outsiders, coming from Saint Paul, MN. They were also way more talented than most of their peers, and more interested in things like songcraft and melody. They were one of the fastest hardcore bands of their era, but they started drawing from the 60s pop of The Byrds and The Beatles - a source post-punk bands like The Soft Boys had likely inspired them to draw from. The Minutemen were also outsiders, and similarly, they wanted to incorporate everything from funk to Creedence Clearwater Revival into their sound. The Post-Punk influence only gets more obvious from there, with Fugazi's biggest influence possibly being Gang of Four, Jawbox having an obvious Joy Division influence, and NoMeansNo being as noisy and weird as any of the post-punk band. The earliest examples of post-rock may be post-punk/new wave acts like Talk Talk and The Durutti Column, who had more ambition with their compositions than virtually any of their peers. However, if there's one album that really started post-rock, it's Slint's Spiderland. And Slint were a straight up punk band. They were literally little kids who would hang out at the punk shows and obsess over bands like Fugazi. Slint started rehearsing obsessively together throughout their teenage years, virtually creating their own musical language. It's basically built on a dynamic where they build tension through long quiet sections, pushing that tension until it gets to a breaking point, then releasing it in these loud, thunderous, cathartic sections that go way farther than loud-quiet-loud conventions of bands like the Pixies or Nirvana. The Post-Metal connection is the most interesting to me. Pretty much the defining Post-Metal band is Neurosis. Neurosis started out as a thrashy punk band, and they were obsessed with the weird, dark, post-punky crust of Amebix. Amebix themselves started out playing a primitive, raw take on Killing Joke's mystical, tribal sound. Making that sound more raw made Amebix sound like a band from a post-apocalyptic hellscape, and Neurosis had the musical ability to explore that more fully than Amebix ever did (before anyone gets into it, yes, I'm aware of Amebix's recent, sad political contoversy). Someone else who deserves a lot of credit for Post-Metal is Justin Broadrick of Godflesh/Jesu. Broadrick got his start in grindcore legends Napalm Death, but when he started, Napalm Death were a noisy, experimental anarcho-punk band. They were influenced by Amebix and Discharge, but I think it's important to consider how connected to post-punk the anarcho-punk scene was. Some of the most amazing post-punk bands came from the anarcho-punk scene, including Flux of Pink Indians, The Ex, Dog Faced Hermans, latter-day Crass, Rudimentary Peni, and Zounds. Napalm Death were surely aware of this, and Broadrick's guitar on recordings like Hatred Surge sounds very bizarre and very post-punk. But even a metallic band like Discharge sounds somewhat avant-garde, with intense political ranting over big, noisy guitars. Broadrick left as Napalm Death started to go in a more death metal direction, with Broadrick going the opposite way, forming Godflesh and drawing from industrial groups like Einst√ºrzende Neubauten and Throbbing Gristle. Helmet is another big influence on post-metal, and they came from the same post-hardcore scene as Quicksand. Another big influence is the sludge metal of bands like the Melvins, who themselves had been influenced by post-punk bands like the U-Men and the Wipers. Sludge is often characterized as simply a combination of raw hardcore and doom metal, but that ignores how experimental and challenging even seemingly straightforward bands like Eyehategod can be, with their thick, noisy guitars. Sludge itself can be traced to Black Flag's album My War, which follows a similar post-hardcore mentality I described earlier - they were sick of hardcore's constraints, and wanted to go in a more challenging direction.","I don't think there's much of a link here except the fact that they're all rock subgenres. Obviously they've been combined before, of course bands like Slint exist, City of Caterpillar also exists, but that doesn't mean that post-rock is actually connected to post-punk more than it is to any other genre. What does Godspeed have to do with Joy Division? Not a thing. In post-hardcore bands vary a lot, but are you really going to tell me that Escape the Fate and Neurosis have anything in common besides the ""post-"" in their genre titles, or that either band genuinely has anything to do with Gang of Four or Wire? That stream of post-hardcore has more to do with 90s punk than it has to do with post- anything. I'd like to ask where post-bop, post-industrial and post-mininalism come into this? You have post-hardcore groups like Midori and Naked City which fall much closer to Charles Mingus and Miles Davis than to Talk Talk or Slint. Anyway, my point isn't that these post- genres aren't linked at all. My point is that most genres are linked regardless, especially if you're just looking at rock subgenres, and it really isn't the ""post-"" that's holding things together.",66
l517yx,"I find it interesting seeing how College Rock Radio was. It wasn‚Äôt a very mainstream thing until bands were being picked up by mainstream labels like Warner Bros. and they created the Billboard Modern Rock Charts for bands like these. I‚Äôve been on a binge listening to a decent amount of these artists. I like that underground aspect you don‚Äôt see too often in music anymore. With the internet being at our fingertips, it‚Äôs hard to really have an underground music genre when you can easily discover new genres. The closest current one I can think of is the Stoner Rock and Doom Metal following, which is quite small.  Some of my favorite groups from that whole college radio scene were H√ºsker D√º, Pixies, The Jesus And Mary Chain, Jane‚Äôs Addiction, and The Smiths. They all captured something special while writing interesting music that even people my age can enjoy (I‚Äôm 20)! There‚Äôs plenty of other of artists/bands that I haven‚Äôt mentioned like R.E.M, Siouxsie and The Banshees, The Cure, The Stone Roses, Violent Femmes, Depeche Mode, Sonic Youth, and The Replacements that also played on College Radio.  It‚Äôs sad that hair metal was more dominant (in the U.S at least) during that time, they had less substance than a lot of the bands you‚Äôd hear on college radio. I guess at the time audiences weren‚Äôt as ready for that type of music. I want to make it clear that I don‚Äôt hate hair metal, but I feel that it hasn‚Äôt aged as well with me as most other genres. It‚Äôs kinda like hip-hop in the 80‚Äôs, the audiences weren‚Äôt as ready, they still had prominent groups like The Beastie Boys and Public Enemy, but wouldn‚Äôt be widely accepted and expanded until the 1990‚Äôs.  We probably all know the story about how alternative and indie became mainstream in the 90‚Äôs. The term college rock would die out in favor of alternative and indie. Alternative rock would also go through another phase in the early 2010‚Äôs with bands like Cage The Elephant, Twenty One Pilots, Foster The People, and Arctic Monkeys as the new alternative. Whether you hate or love the fact those bands are considered the new alternative, that‚Äôs how most people describe alternative as today. People my age are interested in the new alternative and that‚Äôs fine with me.  I guess I might as well ask a few questions to continue the conversation.  Were you alive when college radio was a thing? If so, do you have any memories of that time period? What do you think of the new alternative that has been coming out the last decade? Do any of you have any favorite groups from the college radio period? Did I miss out on anything important when talking about college radio? If so, I would like to hear more about it. I‚Äôm still newer to it and digging into discographies of a lot of them. I‚Äôd like to discuss it more.","You should be able to stream a bunch of MTV 120 minutes on YouTube, it will give you some idea what the general alternative mood was at the time. Search out the Dave Kendall hosted ones, not Matt Pinfield. Pre-1991/Pre-Lollapalooza years.  The breakthrough of Nirvana really changed everything, them and Pearl Jam.  Before Nevermind ‚Äúalternative‚Äù really was alternative. The Pixies were criminally overlooked in their time by the mainstream. Sometimes I imagine today that kids think Echo & the Bunnymen, or the Cure were actually played on the radio. You had to have a decent college station to hear them at all. Or stay up past midnight on Sunday to maybe see them on MTV.  The first Stone Roses is a perfect album, but it sounds like you already heard them. Disintegration by the Cure is another perfect one. I tended more towards shoegazer, proto-shoegazer like Jesus & Mary Chain, Ride, My Bloody Valentine.  Lesser big names to check out- House of Love, Slowdive, an obscure hidden gem for shoegazer is the Drop Nineteens (but only Delaware)",106

l7pie2,"Sometimes a song is so good you have to praise it to the world. For me, this punk masterpiece tops every British single of 1977, which includes ""God Save the Queen"" and ""Complete Control"" (My favourite punk single ever, ""(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais"", wouldn't be released until 1978). At a dicey 162 bpm and a 2:19 duration, it's as intense as anything by the Ramones themselves... The difference being, of course, that the Ramones singles' were fun and anthemic: ""Ex Lion Tamer"" stings and smacks with volume and acidity. Those guitars aren't there for you to rollercoaster on: instead, they wallop you in the jaw.  If ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" makes you feel like you're driving at a 100mph, then ""Ex Lion Tamer"" raises your pulse like you were in a fist fight. Lyrically, it's a masterpiece, with the mundanity of the lives of television viewers juxtaposed against the faux-thrills that the box provides. It acknowledges the boredom of the modern age, and how entertainment can numb us to reality. We become invested in the ""great danger"" that TV series provide whilst surrounded by ""fish fingers all in a line"" and ""milk bottles \[that\] stand empty"". Don't worry if you're unhappy with reality: ""Next week will solve your problems!"" This dystopic tone becomes further emphasised by the ominous mantra, ""Stay glued to your TV set!"", with the moronic cries of ""TV"" in the backing vocals making the listener feel damn uncomfortable. But it's not too patronising: Wire definitely sound complicit in this system, with the narrator seeming to acknowledge just how exciting TV can be from first hand experience. What I've always loved about *Pink Flag* is how ordinary Wire seem on the album... they don't sound like punk heroes (*The Clash*) or punk anti-heroes (*Never Mind the Bollocks*). They sound like normal lads who picked up guitars and decided to get everything wrong with the world off their chest. And ""Ex Lion Tamer"" is the peak of that endeavour. Check it out if you haven't already. Are there any other Wire fans here? A penny for your thoughts? [https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=ex+lion+tamer](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ex+lion+tamer)","Wire are too intelligent for this world IMO. *Pink Flag* is one of the best punk albums of the era because it creates such clear caricatures of society in sixty to ninety seconds pieces. ""Field Day For The Sundays"" is less than thirty seconds and you get such an exact picture of the target of their ire that there is no way to mistake their message. That's the power of this album, it knows what it's doing and does it over and over and over flawlessly like it's a judo routine. It creates portraits of people sliding into mediocrity better than any other punk album because it's as acerbic as it is sincere. It doesn't feel like ""us vs. them"", even if their music is critical it still feels compassionate. I have multiple versions of this album as it's been released and rereleased in various formats with slightly different bonus content over the years. A Japanese expanded version of this album has a live show from the era tacked on. I hope I have this right and I'm not paraphrasing, the banter before going into ""Commercial"" is just ""pay attention, it's the commercial"" to a silent room. How amazing is that as a statement? And the fact that it had no response, you'd have to assume they knew it was going to be the case but this simple sloganeering would be planted into the showgoer's mind and would germinate later.",43

l96g2s,"Music creates a motions in all of us. Happy music makes us feel happy and sad makes us feel sad. But if you, like me, are the kind of person who struggles to express their emotions, ""sad"" music is more than that.  I'm 3 weeks into a breakup from my girlfriend of 7 years. Aside for the breakup conversation, 3 hours sitting and talking, saying goodbyes, I've been unable to express or show any sadness. It only comes out through music, the way music is always pulled emotions out of me.  Suddenly a song about love ending I've listened to a thousand times has a whole new feeling. Like I connect to the song better. Like ah-aha moment in my brain where the original songwriters lyrics finally makes sense the right way.  None of my friends listen to music and process it the way that I do, and that's okay. I don't think there's a right way or wrong way to love the music you love.

l9mxs6,"Jethro Tull completely perplexes me. The hard guitar and Ian Anderson's snarl against catchy riffs and a flute makes total sense. But that's like 5-10 songs. There are dozens of other albums where the band goes into English Folk, Prog Rock, Synth Metal and other areas. And yet, they're really the only Rock band to successfully and consistently integrate the flute. Sometimes, their music sounds like Renaissance Faire stuff. Sometimes it sounds like early Floyd or Traffic. Sometimes it sounds like Dream Theater. Sometimes I think Ian Anderson is sincere and sometimes I think it's a lark. And yet, I know that for 15 years, they had gold and platinum albums and, even in the 80s and 90s, they seemed to have a loyal following. I've listened closely to most of their stuff and I am left with two questions: 1. How do people describe their appeal? 2. What are other bands that have been so consistently unusual and consistently popular for decades? Honestly, Radiohead was a comparable in my mind.","This thread has been tagged as a list thread.

lb01us,"People talk about the Beatles all the time, but it's much rarer to see McCartney's later career discussed as a body of work in its own right, in fact a quick search suggests there's never been a single thread dedicated to it on this subreddit. Despite being much larger in size it often seems like his work gets less discussion than the post-Beatles projects of his fellow Beatles. McCartney's latest release caps off a trilogy spanning his entire post-Beatles career, so it seems as good a time as any to tackle it. Over the years McCartney has had critical successes, as well as critical slatings. He achieved massive chart success, while at other times being hopelessly uncool. His work has been accused of being frivolous, shamelessly commercial and gloopily sentimental. And there's often some truth to that! The case against: * Most would agree Paul peaked in the last years of the Beatles. That's when he was at his most ambitious, and wrote most of his most iconic material. After that, aside from dabbling in the popular styles of the time, and a handful of orchestral and electronic side projects, he mostly sticks to variations on things he's done before. Not much of his stuff tends to be seen as important or essential the way the Beatles and even some of solo Lennon and Harrison is. * John and George usually strived to express something sincere with their music, and tended to disappear when they had nothing left to say.  Paul on the other hand cranks out music relentlessly whether he has anything lyrical to say or not, so you get a lot of simple or nonsensical lyrics, and his work rarely aspires to being deeper than fun pop. You're not going to get raw emotion like Plastic Ono Band, or a rock epic like All Things Must Pass, and his records tend to lack the edgier sensibilities brought in by the other members. The case in favour: * Paul is, I think it's fair to say, a melodic genius, and that didn't stop the second he left the Beatles. And just because he mainly makes pop doesn't mean it's not really good music. His songs continue being full of unforgettable tunes and well crafted arrangements. Plus you get lots of his multi-instrumental skills (it's easy to poke fun at Silly Love Songs, but his bass playing is *tight* on it). * He's prolific and pretty consistent with it. He might not reach Beatles level highs that often, but imo everything he put out from '70 to '83 is at least decent, and there's a lot of it. And though he went on a familiar declining career trajectory in the 80's, he doesn't have many true stinkers and has also had a fairly fruitful late period, with a decent run of albums over recent years. * His catalogue has full of something The Beatles doesn't have (thanks to everyone knowing their work inside out), which is hidden gems. In the 70's especially there are so many singles, b-sides and bonus tracks that long after you're familiar with his main albums you can still find yourself stumbling on great songs that fall through the cracks. I've been deep diving through his catalogue over the last couple of months, so while it's all fresh in my mind, here's a run through of what I see as some of the key McCartney albums: **McCartney (1970)** Might as well start at the beginning. I have a theory that the three songwriting Beatles all rebelled against expectations with their first solo releases. John makes a bleak, raw album that openly rejects the Beatles legend, low-key George goes epic and maximalist, and slick studio perfectionist Paul puts out a home recorded album where half the songs seem intentionally unfinished. You could argue it's more notable for it's historical significance than for the music itself, but Paul was hot off his Beatles prime so even a tossed off album can't help but be good. For the most part it's folksy, low-key, and often instrumental. Though it also includes Maybe I'm Amazed, a soaring anthem that rivals Hey Jude and Let It Be, even if it doesn't really fit with the rest of the album. **Ram (1971)** On the face of it this seems like a more fleshed out version of McCartney, and often gets hailed as proto-indie pop. But under the surface this may be the most dense and complex record he ever made. If McCartney showed Paul holding back, this one is him unrestrained. The tracks are overflowing with twists, turns and freewheeling ideas - sometimes ingenious, sometimes infuriating - that are more carefully thought out than it might seem at first. It's probably not a coincidence that there aren't a lot of famous individual songs on this album, but it's the only one he produced an [almost note-perfect orchestral rendition of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8R3V5mkdgY). **Band On The Run (1973)** Wings had a slightly wobbly start (I have a soft spot for Wild Life but it's almost as raw and unfinished sounding as McCartney 1; Red Rose Speedway has lots of finished songs, but they're not great songs imo), but here Paul managed to pull off maybe his only Beatles-style critical and commercial blockbuster. Not much to say about it, just a front-to-back solid album full of variety and great songs. A natural place to start for Beatles fans wanting to try out solo McCartney (though it's technically ""Wings"", Paul played most of the album). **Venus And Mars (1975)** A decent attempt at a Band On The Run sequel; a similar variety of styles with slightly more of a glam rock feel. The songs are not as classic and the quality dips a bit on the second side, but it's still a confident sounding record where even the non-Paul sung songs (not usually the highlights of Wings albums) are pretty enjoyable.   The bonus disc is also well worth checking out, adding a whole ton of extra songs from the period. **McCartney II (1980)** The slick sound of the later Wings period could hide Paul's eccentricities at times, but they're back with a vengeance on his second one-man-band project, mixing new wave and synthpop influences with some of his most oddball songwriting since the White Album days. For those that click with it, one his weirdest, most colourful and fun albums. The only disappointment is he didn't stick to his guns and make it a double album as originally planned, meaning some of the most striking tracks (Secret Friend and Check My Machine) got relegated to b-sides and bonus tracks. **Chaos And Creation In The Backyard (2005)** That 25 year gap might seem brutal, but after the George Martin produced duo of Tug Of War/Pipes Of Peace (both decent 80's pop; slightly over-and-underrated respectively, with his last great hit singles) Paul falls into familiar boomer legend patterns; awkwardly chasing fast-dating 80's fashions before reverting to tasteful but flat attempts at restoring credibility. Flaming Pie is the strongest of these, but for the most part I don't have a lot of time for this period. C&C however is the real thing, probably thanks to Nigel Godrich nurturing his art rock and singer songwriter sides, bringing out some beautiful (and sometimes uncharacteristically dark) material. From this point onwards all his records are consistently worth hearing again. **McCartney III (2020)** Might as well finish at the end. Even before hearing a note I had to love McCartney for making this. He's 78, extremely rich, and put out a lengthy record just a couple of years earlier, so no one could blame him had he wanted to take a year off and focus on not dying. But circumstances handed him a one-time opportunity to both get in on the 2020 zietgeist with a lockdown album, *and* kick off the decade with a true homegrown solo effort on the 40 and 50 year anniversary of the other two times he did that, turning them into a trilogy that neatly ties his entire solo career together. I find it very satisfying that he did that. What's more, the album is good. It doesn't sound very much like either McCartney I or II, but it serves the same purpose of getting back to a looser, more ragged and personal place after a series of overly polished studio efforts. It might not have any McCartney classics, but it has a lot of variety and is nicely balanced overall. His weathered vocals are undisguised, but creatively (and physically I hope) he still seems in robust health. That's more than enough words from me on the topic of Paul McCartney. What are your own thoughts on his post-Beatles endeavours, gentle reader?","Ram is far and away my favorite of his solo stuff, and really only falls behind the White Album and Revolver for Beatles albums personally.  Wings stuff I was never a huge fan of, but that has been turning in more recent years.",109
lbcgzd,"Hallelujah is an amazing song, one of the greatest and most iconic songs in the popular American canon. It's covered more times than I can count and holds the prestigious honor of being on a Shrek soundtrack. But it also holds a second legacy, a legacy ruled by people who don't know or care about its meaning. I've heard it sung at masses and Church events my whole life, despite being a bitter love song that includes the line ""Well, maybe there's a God above."" Most of the time, they just repeat the refrain or actively change the lyrics to be more religious. Sure, it has a ton of biblical allusions, but so do the majority of poems and prose in Western literature. In addition to being hilariously coopted by religion, it also seems to be Zach Snyder's favorite song to shoehorn in for the sake of deepness. I know that a ton of political songs have had similar legacies, such as Rockin in the Free World, Born in the USA and Fortunate Son. But I don't think any apolitical song has got it quite as bad as Hallelujah.","It's also one of those songs where there was one cover of the original, and then a million covers of the *cover*. Mad World is another example. As for the most misused nonpolitical song, I think Every Breath You Take is another good contender.",320
lc1pag,"CCR is personally one of my all-time favorite bands. Although they didn‚Äôt last very long, they left a fairly impressive body of work, releasing six terrific albums in the span of only three years, how many other bands can claim that? (How they managed to release Green River, Bayou Country and Willie and the Poor Boys in one year is just mind boggling) Okay, Led Zeppelin definitely can, but other than that I struggle to think of another. Hell, even Mardi Gras, by far their worst project, still has some nice tunes in it, at least the ones by John Fogerty. I‚Äôve seen some people describe CCR as being a very back-to-basics type of band, avoiding the psychedelic fashions of the time in favor of    old-fashioned Americana blues rock, and although there is a certain truth to that there is a great deal more going into their work. Actually a good deal of what makes them so great is the way they combined a wide variety of different influences into their sounds such as country, folk, blues, rock and even some soul. I also appreciate the fact that they eschewed popular themes of love and parties, instead focusing on creating songs about bayous, rivers and soaring political anthems that protested against the war.","Worked with a guy in the mid-90's who gave my favorite description of CCR, ""technical wizards they are not, but man do they rock"". I used to listen to them quite a bit back in that same era, but haven't played them much lately.  Had a really fun CCR moment back in '98.  We went to this gigantic 3 day Phish show way the hell up in northern Maine (I was mildly interested in the band, wildly interested in traveling anywhere).  Ended up being an incredibly fun time.  We had traveled up there in my conversion van that was decked out with giant home speakers that could be hauled out of the van and set up outside.  After one of the shows, back at the van for beers, I randomly put on Willy & the Poor Boys and within maybe 10 minutes had all these Phish kids dancing around the van.  Turned it up and attracted even more.  When the groove is that good, you can't help but get drawn to it.",83
lcjp7c,"From the 20th century onward I've definitely noticed a pattern. Early Jazz was derided as ""not music"" by the previous generation but was loved by the youth which in turn created a huge generation gap in the 20's come to be known as the ""Jazz age"". In the 50's once Jazz had become a ""respectable"" form of music to the older generation, a new youthful rebellion bursts onto the scene: Rock 'n Roll. Another massive generation gap so significant that it gives birth to new term: the teenager. Decades on, like Jazz, Rock began to be seen as a legitimate form of music by the establishment, and as Rock became generational and terms like ""Dad rock"" became a thing, Rock started to lose a bit of it's edge as a rebellious youthful movement. Here comes Hip Hop, which created a generation gap so unprecedented, that it still being debated whether it's ""music"" or not. And this is not even taking into account other rebellious genres of music like the Blues, Reggae, Soul, House/Techno, etc. all of which were spearheaded by young people at the time they were created. My question is this: do new genres of music always start with young people reacting against the ""status quo"" so to speak? Is youth & rebellion a vital part in the creation of new genres? And does becoming respectable/accepted by older generations make said genre lose a bit of it's edge & appeal to younger generations?","I don‚Äôt think every single new genre of music is rebellious against the status quo or based in youthful rebellion. Some def are, see punk or grunge as the ultimate example.  But I think it‚Äôs older people who set this trend. The older you are the more you are resistant to change.  And it‚Äôs these people that set the narrative not the youth imo.  And this doesn‚Äôt even cover musicians , most musicians are always looking for a new genre and if they aren‚Äôt writing the music are often working behind the scenes to help the youth flourish.",92
ldlduc,"When most people think of Warren Zevon the think of 'Werewolves or London'. Most know little beyond this  track, which to me is a damn tragedy.  I simply love the music and I'm always astonished at how unrated Zevon is outside of certain circles. I've seen him described as a songwriters' songwriter. His catalog is packed with guest appearances from those more commercially successful than he; Bruce Springsteen, Linda Ronstadt, Don Henley, Stevie Nicks, David Gilmour, Jackon Brown, Joe Walsh, REM and a boatload of others.  Despite the clear admiration from contemporaries, this never seemed to translate to the wider public.   To me though listening to his music is like listening to an old friend and skilled storyteller. His lyrics and imagery are nothing short of masterful. You can see some beautiful examples here and we're only scratching the surface: https://www.popmatters.com/10-best-warren-zevon-lyrics-2495742581.html Warren's music seems to occupy a distinctively unique place in my heart. Despite having a lengthy career, I only wish there was more music to explore. James Campion in the book 'Accidentally Like a Martyr: The Tortured Art of Warren Zevon' does a fantastic job at relating how Warren's music digs into your very soul, and when your hooked there's no escape. Here's an bit a really loved and totally related to: ""Listening for that voice allows a light to go on somewhere, which illuminates the Zevon Corner and gives you a special pass inside that invites you to fully explore. And trust me, you never stop exploring. This is the musical equivalent of a scar. You carry his music with you. You can't understand how someone wouldn't want to bear the mark. You will quote it. You will hum it. You will revel in it."" What's your thoughts on Warren Zevon?  I've also created a Spotify playlist of what I feel showcases some of Warren's finest moments. However, I find something to admire in 99% of his work be it a single line, a musical motif to the entire composition!

That having been said Excitable Boy and the self-titled are just great.",53
ldzfna,"""Originally released in January of 1997, 'Perfect from Now On' could easily be considered Built to Spill‚Äôs masterpiece. Their two previous albums had been fairly brief affairs filled with smart power-pop songs that knew how to get in, give the hook, and get out, but 'Perfect from Now On' took a different route; the songs are longer and more complex, often stitching various song sections together and then letting them clash against each other.""","Perfect From Now On is one of my all time favorite albums. Randy Described Eternity blew my mind wide open the first time I heard it, and the rest of the album is an incredible journey.  As a side note, Built to Spill is an incredible live band and anyone who likes them should know that they have a permissive taping policy and a tape collection on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/BuiltToSpill). Interestingly enough, the changes in their studio sound that came with Perfect From Now On didn‚Äôt immediately translate to their live show. Doug Martsch had just brought on Brett Nelson and Scott Plouf as his rhythm section, and they didn‚Äôt have a ton of time to learn material after recording the album and before going on tour. So most 1997 shows have similar set lists and a stripped down punky sound that‚Äôs more like their first two albums. By 1998 they had more live repertoire including some interesting covers like a punk rock Linus and Lucy, but their live show still didn‚Äôt sound much like Perfect From Now On. That changed in 1999 when they enlisted Jim Roth as a touring guitarist (and later full band member). That allowed them to expand from the stripped down power trio sound into the more expansive spaces they‚Äôd reached in the studio. Of course the peak era for live Built to Spill is when they brought on Brett Netson as a third full time guitarist in addition to Doug and Jim. I personally feel like 3 guitarists in a band is almost always a bad thing because it‚Äôs hard to avoid stepping on each others‚Äô toes and sounding too noodly. But Doug Martsch, Jim Roth, and Brett Netson really listen to each other and work as a cohesive unit so that it never sounds too busy. Usually one might be playing lead, another rhythm, and the third might be adding textures and accents in the background. The result is a layered, nuanced sound that‚Äôs almost more like what you can do in the studio with overdubs, but in a live and often improvised context.",59
leq6kj,"I've been digging my heels into electronic music for about 3 or 4 years now; you could say I'm fairly new to the scene. Aphex Twin was my gateway drug into many electronic music genres, which I'm sure many could relate to. As long as I've been into music I've always been most influenced by the soundscape and texture of songs. So it would be no surprise that Boards of Canada was an immediate hook.  For those of you who have been familiar with the genre and the tangential artists to BoC during their hayday a few decades ago, did they have a huge impression on the community or have they always been a quiet hit? I'm not terribly knowledgeable about artists with ambient/chill aspects but it really seems like BoC was extremely influential.  I think it was a bit different back in the 90s and early 00s when electronic music wasn't quite as digital as it is now, but there is something absolutely magical about BoC's synthesized analogue sound. Their use of public broadcast programming samples and the textures is so meticulously deliberate yet seems instantly familiar to just about anyone who hears their music. I'm a young millennial, I wasn't alive in the 80s, but even I feel the intense nostalgia (borrowed nostalgia, perhaps) in their yesteryear tones.  I find their music fascinating, esoteric, ambiguous, and for the most part, calming.  Are they an artist who used to be more popular, perhaps in their prime? As a newcomer, I just wish I had more context to their history.",Just dropping in to say that BoC is my all time favorite electronica group. Their albums are so mesmerizing and meditative. They also have a creepy/dark vibe to them a lot of the time that is very engaging and hooks me. My favorite song by them is [Dayvan Cowboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2zKARkpDW4) and it gives me chills every time.  Even listening back through their albums that I've heard start-to-finish dozens of times I find new nuances and quirks to their instrumentation that are so subtle but effective.,70
lfb4n3,"I would not consider myself a huge fan of Fleetwood Mac. Obviously, they've been omnipresent in rock music for my entire life so even not being a fan, you get a sense of their overall image. Over the past few years when I've heard a Fleetwood Mac song that I like, it seems like it is always one that has Christine McVie on lead vocals. In thinking about this, I thought I'd take a look at Fleetwood Mac's singles discography and, surprise, it wasn't just me. I'm using the U.S. charts for this analysis. You can use whatever your home country's chart is and you'll probably come up with the same results. Here in America, Fleetwood Mac have 17 top 20 singles (Peter Green era FM didn't chart here at all). Of those 17, McVie is lead vocalist on nine of them (one is a duet with Buckingham straight down the line, you can give her 8 1/2 singles if you like). They include ""Say You Love Me"", ""Don't Stop"", ""You Make Loving Fun"", and ""Little Lies"" among others. If you were to go by image and promotions alone, you'd think Stevie Nicks was the lead singer. She is lead vocalist on six of FM's top 20 singles (in researching this, I found that ""Landslide"" was never issued as a single until 1998 where it peaked outside if the US top 20 after being on classic rock radio every day for a decade). Lindsey Buckingham has two solo vocal US hits and the aforementioned duet with McVie. Combined, Nicks and Buckingham have as many top 20 hits as McVie. So, what say you LTM? I'm not making the case for Christine McVie being *underrated* because there is no way in which Fleetwood Mac is underrated but I think she is the band's low key heavy hitter that deserves a little more acknowledgement than she gets.",Songbird and Oh Daddy are by far the worst songs on Rumours. I always wish they axed those songs and added silver springs.,48
lfnvqe,"I don't do this very often, but every now and again I come across an artist who's music is so impressive to me that I make a conscious effort NOT to binge their work. I try to pace my listening out so that I still have some of their music to check out at a later date. And usually when I do this, I end up saving some albums for special occasions when I feel like the time is just right to check them out. For instance, it's snowing right now in the UK, and because we're in a national lockdown the streets have been real empty. So I used this as an opportunity to listen to ""F#A#"" by Godspeed You! Black Emporer while on a walk. After listening to ""Lift your Skinny Fists..."" I knew I'd come across an amazing artist so I decided to restrict myself and not binge all their albums at once. I used to save my first listen of Pink Floyd albums for LSD trips, but my days of psychs are pretty much over now so I don't do that anymore. I'm currently saving Jessica Pratt's 2012 self titled album for some occasion in the future (I listened to Quiet Signs a few months ago and it sent me to mystic state). Sometimes I'm let down by waiting (I remember waiting to listen to ""Mental Health"" by Aimee Mann for a certain time and being pretty disappointed), but generally I've found this work out well.  I was wondering if other people save the first listens of certain albums for special occasions. What are your opinions on treating music like this?",Lift Yr Skinny Fists was the *exact* record that came to mind when I read the topic of this! I save that record for long trips on a plane/car etc. It's like a movie and it occupies time so magnificently.,81

lhi0v0,"I've noticed recently there seem to be a few more rock based or at least rock inspired acts making it into the pop scene. In the UK Yungblud has a punk element and uses a full band, and in the more underground scene bands like Black Midi and Black Country, New Road are getting some attention. We also have Phoebe Bridgers getting big and a few more pop acts adding live bands to their sound and Machine Gun Kelly releasing a pop punk album. Not saying it's overtaking hiphop or rap or anything like that, just noticed there seemed to be a few more lately.","I can‚Äôt speak about the UK, but most of the bands you mentioned are completely unknown in the US. Phoebe Bridgers is growing in popularity, and was even nominated for a Grammy, for best new artist, but I don‚Äôt consider her to be ‚Äúrock‚Äù. When you say guitar based music, that could be anything. Frank Ocean‚Äôs last album Blonde, could be considered guitar based. H.E.R., or Lianne La Havas, could be considered guitar based. There are jazz albums that are guitar based, country albums, etc. If you‚Äôre talking about ‚Äúrock‚Äù music, no I don‚Äôt see any significant resurgence. If you‚Äôre talking about guitar based music, I think that‚Äôs too broad. Guitar based music has never gone away, but the genre of ‚Äúrock‚Äù has certainly faded.",180
lhxqvo,"Jazz fusion pioneer Chick Corea passed away on February 9th, at the age of 79, from a rare form of cancer which was only discovered recently. From his early work as a sideman and bandleader with Miles Davis, Mongo Santamaria, Roy Haynes, and many others, to leading seminal groups like Return to Forever and the Elektric Band, this post alone wouldn't be able to do justice to Chick's expansive legacy. I was turned on to Chick Corea's music from [this Tiny Desk Concert](https://youtu.be/15IHNYq6stw) with vibraphonist Gary Burton. This video alone is one of the sole reasons I want to become a musician; seeing this level of virtuosity and freedom in improvisation is inspiring and still blows my mind whenever I listen to it, which is probably every other day.  On top of that, since I'm a younger person listening to more contemporary acts, seeing people like Cory Henry, Jesus Molina, Justin Lee Schultz, and Yohan Kim pay their respects to Chick's music with covers and hearing Chick's influence on their improvisation is a clear example of the impact of his work on modern day musicians playing in this style. Lastly, since the pandemic began, Chick was more active online and on social media than ever. Listening to impromptu arrangements of his original work [on Youtube ](https://youtu.be/Ph_bFM9DM4Y)  and hearing his advice about music and life has had an immense impact on me throughout this time, as I'm sure it has on many others as well. What are your favorite points in Chick Corea's career? What albums or concerts online would you recommend? I'd love to talk about Chick Corea's music and legacy with all of you.","I really like Chick Corea. A great deal has been since his death about his great work as a sidemen and his improvisation ability, but he had a truly amazing solo career.

liad0e,"I was recently listening to My Bloody Valentine's Loveless and kept thinking about how the cover art reflects the sound and feel of the album flawlessly. Some other examples for me would include Pixies' Doolittle and Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures. Do you pay any attention to how the cover relates to the contents ? Can you think of any albums that in your opinion feel exactly how they look ? Obviously most cover arts are in itself meant to represent the music behind them and in the grand scheme of things they shouldn't really matter that much (like with The Beatles' White Album), but they do have the ability to point you in a certain direction and tell you what to expect when you pick up the record.","Kid A by Radiohead.

lj30j0,"I assume it's because the smaller artists usually don't have the legal resources or money to fight the case but if it's a clear theft of intellectual property, wouldn't they win?  Like in a case like this, Lizzo's [Good As Hell](https://youtu.be/SmbmeOgWsqE) is built entirely off a sample of the intro from Night Moves' [Border on Border](https://youtu.be/VJ_3F1GKCmg)   Yet still there is no writing credit for Night Moves, there's no mention of them or the sample online or anywhere near related to Lizzo. And they are both from Minneapolis, so I find it hard to be a coincidence or that they wouldn't have heard it. Do they not have the legal prerogative to win this in court?","So I understand your point here, but the example you‚Äôve brought up doesn‚Äôt really apply and I also think this line of thinking is dangerous.  The two songs do sound similar at a glance but this is because they use the same chord progression (though in different keys) in a similar rhythm. It‚Äôs IV - iii - ii. In other words both are using chords built from the fourth scale degree then the third then the second. If you think in the key of C (with C being the 1) it would F - Em - Dm.  The piano part is definitely not a sample, in the Lizzo track you can hear a melody in the right hand of the piano on the first chord (more clear the second time through the progression) which is absent from the Night Moves track. A sample is not a replayed part but rather an edit of an existing recording. This is not that.  So yes the songs do have similarities as listed above but you cannot, and should not, be able to sue over a chord progression. In most western popular music almost every chord is going to be diatonic (meaning in the key) this doesn‚Äôt give you many options as there are only 7 root notes to choose from. Not all combinations of these seven root notes sound satisfying either, this is why we see so many repeated chord progressions throughout pop music, 1-5-6-4 being the most common. If people were able to sue over chord progressions the music being made would quickly get real weird and no one would have been able to write half the songs we all know and love.  I actually believe we‚Äôve gotten to a really bad place with copyright infringement and music. The Blurred Lines case from a few years ago was over a groove, a similar one yes, but that‚Äôs like suing someone because they also made a film about a superhero that can fly. Songs are more than their individual parts and should be treated as such. Artists are a sum of their influences so there will always be pieces of their musical lineage in their works. We need to embrace this and not sue for inspirations as we are taking away a lot of creative avenues.",208
ljyjpe," The other day I was reading a poem by [Jorge Luis Borges called Limits](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=38643) and I couldn't help but think about how great it would be if there were more rap lyrics that gave space for each listener to form their own interpretation. The 99% of rap lyrics throw you the message straight to the face without much room for interpretation and while I love the storytelling of rappers such as Kendrick Lamar and Daveed Diggs or the wordplay of MF DOOM, I must say I would like to see more rap lyrics that use metaphors or cryptic / abstract elements such as poetry where you have to read several times to try to get your own interpretation of each line. DEATH GRIPS has that abstract element sometimes and I love it.  Does anyone know of a rapper who has lyrics like this? If you write lyrics like that, would it be considered spoken word instead of rap?","Milo is an easy one that comes to mind.

ll825e,"Fifteen years ago, at a middle school somewhere in Michigan, Raindrop (Matthew Hayes) and Mike Glambin (Mike Glambin) went to battle. Back and forth they traded blows in a rap battle that many considered Raindrop to have won handily. Mike Glambin starts off with a dagger but fails to follow up almost immediately, setting the tone for an overall shaky performance. After attempting to mic drop Raindrop just after his second stanza, Raindrop falls in with lyrics bashing what we assume is Mike Glambin's sexual orientation, finishing off his turn with one of the most interesting lines in rap history indicating that Mike's ""face all wells up and it - fades away, yo."" It is at least indicative that Raindrop has listened to hip hop in the past with his inclusion of the word ""yo"", something Mike Glambin strays away from. During the next round, Mike focuses on the lack of poetry from his opponent and then proceeds to shit all over what Raindrop decided to wear to school that day. Mike then ends the stanza almost challenging Raindrop to come back at him by proclaiming ""you can't mess with me."" Knocked down a peg, Raindrop tries to fire back, but once again falling back on Mike's sexual orientation. After that, he starts beating up on Mike for his prior failure during the battle where Mike indicated that he didn't know what to say. This indicates that Raindrop was able to think on the fly and attacked his opponent over something that his opponent failed at mere moments prior. Perhaps one of the most memorable moments of the entire battle occurs at the end here as the camera comes in close to Raindrop and as he delivers his final line, the heat (either from his mouth or from his lyrics) fogs the camera lens. Mike attempts a hail mary, going after Raindrop's overweight physique, but once again falters at the end, indicating that he doesn't know what to say. It's Raindrop's battle to lose at this point and Raindrop delivers. In the last stanza from Raindrop, he proceeds to rattle off poetry which could rival Shakespeare by inventing words to work into his rhymes (fert, poons maybe?), heavily focused on repetition of the ""oo"" sound. He delivers on trashing Mike's clothes, who he hangs out with, and where he lives, after which he drops the mic on Glambin, indicating that he's a ""foo"". &#x200B; The discussion regarding this rap battle: Are raindrops lyrics considered unacceptable in modern times due to his incessant reliance on bashing Mike Glambin for allegedly being gay (or bisexual, considering a lyric which indicates Mike Glambin may be associated with hoes as well)? This really seems like a video that would have aired over the school's television system as a part of weekly announcements done by a school's junior broadcast team. Even if the competitors chosen would have done a fantastic job, is a rap battle an inherently bad idea considering their nature which is meant to be demeaning? Should this battle be criticized to a modern standard or should it be seen in a positive light as a time capsule for how things used to be in the mid aughts? What other questions should we be asking of this battle? &#x200B; [Video](https://youtu.be/MA8rhf2KVzs) &#x200B; Lyrics: {Intro: Mike Glambin, Cameraman, Raindrop} {Cameraman} That's a nice locker you got there, dude {Raindrop} Raindrop, opening my locker, take two {Hook: Mike Glambin} You think you're all that, but you're not I don't know what to say {Verse 1: Mike Glambin} You think you can rap, but you choke You're a fricking joke You're gay, you can't get a girl anyway I'm done {Verse 2: Raindrop} Yo, you're gay You suck fags, oh All night, that, your face all wells up And it fades away Yo {Verse 3: Mike Glambin} Dude, you can't even rhyme What a crime You're wearing a blue T I, you can't mess with me {Verse 4: Raindrop} Yo, yo You suck balls, along with hoes You're so gay that, you, you Don't know what to say You're gay {Verse 5: Mike Glambin} Your name is Matt You're really fat {Hook: Mike Glambin} You think you're all that, but you're not I don't know what to say {Verse 6: Raindrop} You have a bull on your shirt You look like a fert from a cartoon A coon, and it ruins like poons You live with racoons, animal boom You live in Kalamazoo You foo'","i'm glad that you've brought up this pivotal moment in the history of modern popular music. 00s rap, let alone 00s rap originating from the internet, tends to be under-discussed on this subreddit, which leads us away from discussing gems like this. i also appreciate your transcription, it makes it a lot easier to follow along. >Are raindrops lyrics considered unacceptable in modern times due to his incessant reliance on bashing Mike Glambin for allegedly being gay (or bisexual, considering a lyric which indicates Mike Glambin may be associated with hoes as well)? yeah, homophobia isn't cool anymore. i recall Offset being criticized for stating, in a lyric, ""I cannot vibe with queers."" and that, although still very problematic, is a lot more tame then Raindrop's use of epithets.  however, his use of the word c*** wouldn't even work back then, at least in the mainstream. kid probably would've been cancelled these days for that alone, since we're all considering the precedence of the racist white man attempting to appropriate the music of minorities without giving respect to his influences. reminds me of white jazz band The Original Dixieland Jass Band, who had the honor of being the first recorded in the genre. but their clarinetist, Nick LaRocca, claimed to invent jazz and disparaged the talent of musicians he was clearly influenced by. it was okay back in the 1920s (although we're quite critical these days), but this decade? Raindrop would have a lot to answer for. of course, he looks like he was 12. probably had no fucking idea what he said was a racist slur. whatever. >This really seems like a video that would have aired over the school's television system as a part of weekly announcements done by a school's junior broadcast team. Even if the competitors chosen would have done a fantastic job, is a rap battle an inherently bad idea considering their nature which is meant to be demeaning? off the cuff like Raindrop and Glambin tried to do in this video? no way in hell would that work. even if they somehow avoided using slurs, somebody would get pissed off anyway. still, maybe a pre-written skit akin to Epic Rap Battles of History would've worked. children love that shit, i'm pretty sure its still going on. >Should this battle be criticized to a modern standard or should it be seen in a positive light as a time capsule for how things used to be in the mid aughts? this...is unironically an interesting question. i'm not sure how much we can criticize dumbass children who clearly have no idea what they're even saying, but its actually interesting to see them attempt to imitate the hip hop culture of the time. their use of homophobic remarks is a good example, and makes this video nicely pair with Kanye West's famous interview where he [discussed the homophobia of the scene at the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp45-dQvqPo) (which came out the same year, actually. perhaps he had Raindrop in mind). but i digress, i don't think positive or negative are the best words for something like this. there's things to be critical of, and things to laugh of, but its just plain interesting to think about how hip-hop impacted on the youth of the day.  >What other questions should we be asking of this battle? where are they now? it would be incredible of one of them actually became a decent rapper or musician, but having had ""rap battles"" when i was younger myself, i highly doubt this. sure, Raindrop's slant rhymes show potential, as the slant rhyme is the cornerstone of technical rap lyrics. but after a video like this goes viral, i would think he'd prefer to be forgotten. which makes this video kind of unfortunate, if you think about it. the internet and the real world of the mid 00s were a lot more disconnected back then, and it was probably easier to do stuff like this and get away with it without the internet holding a record of it for the rest of your life. plenty of kids were and continue to be guilty of being what we call ""pure cringe"", but rarely are so many people familiar with these cringe actions. perhaps they look back on this video lovingly, but for real? in their place i would not be able to even look at the title, and i can't imagine anyone thinking differently.",99

I won't even pretend that Johnson's AC/DC doesn't sound the same.

You have songs like Rockin' in the Parlour, and The Jack. Crabsody in Blue, and Looysiana Swamp Stomp. And let's not forget the badass instrumental Midnight Rock.    You can look at all of these songs -- and a *ton* more -- and see that they don't at all sound alike.

People seem to bring up the more stripped down, lyrical type artists while not paying as much attention to the musical side of things.

No.  It is actually hard to write great and original songs from simple basis. I would argue that in addition to being a genius lyricist Dylan has always had a really good ear for melodies.

ln518k,"When I was younger, 11 years old, during the height of popularity for Green Day's American Idiot, I decided to do an experiment.  I put my American idiot cd into my boombox and I put my favourite song, ""Wake Me Up When September Ends"", on repeat. Then went to bed for the night with it playing in the background.  I don't know why I did this, I guess I just wanted to see what would happen. If it would allow me to memorize every moment of the song, I guess. The next morning I remember waking up and the song was still playing so I turned it off. I was doing this summer day camp thing that week where you make goofy videos on imacs for fun.  I had ""wake me up when September ends"" burned onto a cd and my plan was to use it in my strange stop motion movie. I put the track onto the imovie timeline and started to play it...  It sounded **fucked**.   Like every instrument was out of tune, like something was incredibly wrong with it, every string pluck like nails on a chalkboard. I couldn't get past ten seconds, something about my favourite song suddenly repulsed me. My theory as an 11 year old was that I took what was regularly a long drawn out period of obsession over a song for most people and condensed it into one night. Creating the overplayed/ ""im sick of this song"" mentality tenfold in just one night. Thankfully, now, WMUWSE doesn't sound as bad as it did that day to me, but I still couldn't listen to that song for years after that night without feeling uncomfortable chills down my spine and like I wanted to tear me ears off. I'm curious if anyone has any similar experience with overplaying music to such an extreme point of manufacturing your own disgust.  Or if there is any sort of academic literature on this phenomenon.  Who knows? Maybe it's just not a very good song....  EDIT: Wow. Great to see this blew up. A lot of people here are talking about mildly getting sick of a song. I'm curious to see if anyone has pulled the same experiment as me and had similar results.

loyb9j,"Perry has arguably invented, or been highly influential, in not one, not 2 but 3 musical genres. Namely, Reggae, Ska and Dub. Today, reggae continues to feature heavily in global charts in its various forms. Dub is used on thousands of remixes. Yet he isn't recognised for his production work in the same way as perhaps, George Martin or Phil Spector. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svR8Tthy6pE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svR8Tthy6pE)","Within the closely-related world of those genres, yes, he's absolutely a revered legend. The issue is that none of them are especially large enough with the mainstream clout to make the notable figures within it well-known outside of Jamaica. You see similar things happening when an artist is incredibly well-known by those who play the same instrument, but has little to no mainstream recognition. James Jamerson and Jaco Pastorius are absolute legends in the bass community. While Jaco has the additional problem of primarily working in jazz fusion, not really the most popular of genres, Jamerson played on tons of well-known number one hits. It's a combination of being a typically uncredited member of the house band for an influential studio (much like Duck Dunn, Carole Kaye, or any number of others) and, again, never being the one in the spotlight. They're not at the same level of influence, but Bruce Thomas (Elvis Costello's backing band, the Attractions) and John Taylor (Duran Duran) are also relative unknowns among the public at large. Geezer Butler is fairly well-known, but his fame pales massively in comparison to Ozzy or even Tony Iommi. So you're *partially* right. But only because in America there isn't *anyone* in reggae, ska, or dub who's well-known outside of Bob Marley. Not even Peter Tosh, Prince Buster, or Jimmy Cliff. The latter of whom, it turns out, *is* in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",141
lpq7xa,"Welp, that was unexpected: Daft Punk has announced they are splitting after nearly a decade of not doing anything. Let's talk about your favorite Daft Punk songs,  your favorite experiences to their music, and what the band has meant to you? There is a lot to unpack personally, it's going to take some time. Let's mourn together.","This is surprising to me. These guys have been together as a band longer than not, and have been producing stuff just a few years back. They have always been a band with slow output (4 albums in 28 years) so that wasn't unusual for them. The break-up is unusual. I wonder why they broke up. Are they quitting music or will continue as solo artists? Will they be trying their hand in different things? (Bangalter was always interested in filmmaking) Anyway, Daft Punk is sick. All their records are solid. Discovery may be my favorite electronic album. They defined the house music sound of an era.",267
lqmda8,"There have been a couple posts in the past couple days that have argued to what extent certain musicians can be singlehandedly credited with starting or representing a genre (electronic music *is* Daft Punk, reggae *is* Bob Marley, etc.) and personally I think it is very misleading and only captures a bit of the story of a given genre or technique. There are several ways to determine the defining artist of a genre and they in general lead to different results: **The artist from the genre who is currently the most prominent, best-selling, critically acclaimed, etc.** - This seems to be the default in a lot of areas and yields a very ""[great man theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory)"" result in which the heroic efforts of one musician or band are emphasized above all others. For instance, the Beatles are pop-rock, Bob Marley is reggae, Michael Jackson is modern pop, Elvis is 1950s rock and roll, etc.  Representatively, for metal this would probably be Metallica (the best selling metal band) or Black Sabbath (for critical acclaim). **The first artist to produce a great, acclaimed work in the genre** - This is [noff01](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/ar0sog/1111_essential_recordings_of_music/)'s approach, and it can lead to different results if the first master of a genre wasn't particularly commercially successful or isn't particularly popular nowadays (for instance, noff picks the Upsetters over Bob Marley for reggae while demoting Bob to represent only roots reggae). For metal, this would be Black Sabbath, generally considered to have recorded the first great albums of heavy metal (and among the best metal albums of all time). **The first artist to commercially record music that's recognizably in or ancestral to the genre** - This is a funky one in that it will favor comparatively obscure 1950s-era artists (Joe Hill Louis, Barbie Gaye, Tom Dissevelt, Raymond Scott, Louis Jordan) who may have recorded a couple tracks resembling a modern style but never really developed it into a genre as the 1950s was the first era when a full variety of sounds (distortion, studio processing, electronic timbres via crude synths/oscillators/organ drawbars) and ethnic and regional musical traditions (mambo, calypso, Asian and Polynesian-tinged exotica, African-inspired percussion) were accessible and palatable to the Western popular-music audience. For metal, this would be disputed as a number of 1950s blues and rock musicians utilized distortion and chords similar to metal (Joe Hill Louis, Pat Hare, Link Wray, and maybe Howlin' Wolf come to mind). If you require one fully metal song, there are several candidates from the Beatles, the Kinks, the Who, Led Zep, and Blue Cheer (such as Helter Skelter). **The artist that is closest to the center of mass of the genre/best represents its sound and culture as perceived either by its fans or the general public** - This obviously is heavily colored by commercial popularity, but there is also the factor of stereotypes (for instance, extreme metal checks off a lot more stereotypes of heavy metal and has a lot more uniquely ""metal"" stylistic features than Metallica does). For metal, this would likely go to an extreme metal band like Mayhem or Death, which ticks off a lot of the stereotypes and distinguishing features of metal (Sabbath are too slow and bluesy, Metallica are too commercially-oriented, and the bluesmen I listed earlier don't have *all* the key attributes of metal). So, is this way of breaking out the different ways of identifying genre-defining artists ""better"" or ""worse"" than the ""great man"" approach? Are there other ways of identifying genre-making artists that I didn't get to? How else would you identify the artists behind the popular genres of an era? Just for reference, the key-artist list I generated for metal is: electric bluesmen, Beatles/Kinks/Who, Sabbath, Metallica, Death/Mayhem. The key artists for reggae would likely be 1950s R&B/early 1960s ska, [a whole bunch of obscure late 1960s musicians](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Reggae/), the Upsetters, Bob Marley, (as he is both the most successful reggae musician and one that checks off almost all the stereotypes and genre traits of classic reggae), and maybe a dancehall star like Sean Paul. For electronic dance music (which includes French house) the key artists would be electronic pop pioneers like Raymond Scott/Tom Dissevelt, Giorgio Moroder/maybe Kraftwerk, the core Chicago house and Detroit techno pioneers, Daft Punk, and Skrillex (representing the ""stereotypical"" EDM genre of bro-dubstep).","I've thought about this a fair amount recently. I think generally it is a mistake to think about it as ""great man history"". While there are some things that I think you could probably say were the result of one band/person doing one thing, for most of the progress that happens it is the result of trends.      For example I'll give you two things that The Who are credited for innovating. Smashing guitars and Marshall stacks. I'm not sure if smashing your instruments on stage becomes as popular as it was without The Who doing it first and frequently. The Who were also the first to start playing with a huge stack of speakers like that, but I think if they hadn't someone else would've. So for one of those I think you can ""great man history"" The Who and say the musical landscape would be different. But for the other, someone else would've wanted to play that loud eventually. So the only question is did they accelerate progress, and if so by how much.  When we look at the history of music we want to point at it and go ""this band created X"", but it is rarely that simple. You talk about metal a fair bit in you post, so I'll use that as an example. People want to point to just one group from around '69 or '70 and credit them with ""creating"" metal, or being the first metal band, but it is not that simple. A lot of bands were getting heavier around that time, it was just a trend that was happening. What caused that trend? Who knows! Maybe it was cultural or social shifts, maybe new technology, maybe something else all together, but it probably wasn't just one band who changed everything. By 1968 recorded labels were pushing blues legends [Howlin' Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Howlin%27_Wolf_Album) and [Muddy Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Mud) to make heavy blues-rock albums, but somehow when Led Zeppelin does the same thing the year after we view them as revolutionary. In reality Zeppelin were doing the same thing those record executives were doing, following the trends. There was no great leap forward, just a series of smaller steps.",171
lreqzf,"I'm as guilty as anyone of using decades as a shorthand descriptor for music. When I say 70s rock and 80s rock, most folks will have some kind of mental image of how the two decades are different. For many genres, the end of a decade coincides well enough with stylistic breaks. Hip-hop changed around 1988 or 1989 but it's close enough that 80s hip-hop and 90s hip-hop has an easy, identifiable boundary. But this cyclical nature of music doesn't always coincide with decades. **When does this approach to describing music not work?** In my opinion, the end of the 70s has a convergence of genres that don't adhere to the end of the decade. The split between the 70s and 80s isn't an accurate descriptor for punk music. Disco music didn't really end with the 70s as most people assume (""Call Me"" by Blondie, produced by Giorgio Moroder, was the #1 song of the year in the United States in 1980).  Roots reggae doesn't have a dramatic change between the end of the 70s and beginning of the 80s (and, additionally, Jamaican dancehall doesn't have a huge stylistic change between the end of the 80s and beginning of the 90s). I know someone is going to come through with ""it's stupid to describe a genre by decades"". Okay, era is a prevalent way to describe music. I didn't come up with it and I won't be the last to use it. Final thought: the decade split has historically fit rock music well but isn't quite as applicable to other genres. Is using decade as a way to describe music a relic of rockism?","Post-punk is a good example of a genre where decade boundaries don‚Äôt really work. The genre was rather active in the late 70s and early 80s and there was not a major change from 1979 to 80. Most genres that are bound to one decade arise in the early to mid part of it. Honestly, it‚Äôs hard to think of any genre that rose in the late part of the decade and didn‚Äôt carry over into the first year or 2 of the next decade. Psychedelic rock is really the only exception I can think of; it‚Äôs very much the soundtrack of the late 60s, but was dying out by 1970.",175
ls6uy1,"In the last 3 years, my ""musical knowledge"" grew a lot, I discovered tons of new kinds of music, studied some music theory, and it was pretty good, but recently I started noticing that I kinda ""lost"" my love for music, I'm not getting that ""F\*\*K YEA"" from any song, everything just became somewhat boring, no matter the kind of music I'm listening to, I just cannot enjoy the music as I used to. It's like I don't hear any feelings in them, just notes, rythm, arrangements, and stuff like this. Even the lyrics has lost its touch, since I started viewing vocals as just another instrument in the composition. Does anyone have some advice to make me ""ignorant"" about music again?","Lay off it and do something else. Read a book, watch a movie, learn a craft.

lsm7yd,"Radiohead is known for their nasally vocals and nonsensical lyrics, particularly more in songs from their later albums, such as Kid A, Amnesiac and In Rainbows. For some this might be a negative factor, and a source of much annoyance with the band. But for me, this aspects is exactly one of the things that make me love them so much. Don't get me wrong, Radiohead isn't the only band that utilizes vague lyrics so as to allow people to have their own interpretations, sort of like a Rorschach test. But Thom Yorke takes it one step further, intentionally making his singing so slurred, and ""off"" sounding in terms of pronunciation, that without seeking out the lyrics it's almost impossible to know what he's actually saying. This is one of the reasons why [Reckoner](https://youtu.be/pYHEpDnvVPk) is one of my favorite songs. When I first heard it, I did not know what he was saying, but at the same time I knew exactly what he was trying to say. It did not speak to me logically like language usually communicates, it spoke to me straight to the soul, like a guitar solo would. And I think that was the point: to make the vocals become just another instrument, unbound by the limits and shackles of language. When I was about to google the lyrics to Reckoner, I was afraid. Afraid that seeing the lyrics would diminish the value of the song for me, like with so many other songs from other artists that I had searched the lyrics of. That it would make the personal relationship and meaning I developed with this song obsolete when I found out the ""true"" authorial meaning behind it. But that did not happen, the lyrics turned out to be almost as ""meaningless"" as the vocals. And when a song appears to be about nothing, it ends up being about anything and everything. To me, Reckoner is a song about overcoming my own nihilism, to see the universe unfold and reveal itself to me (the part at 3:16), showing that things aren't as bleak as I thought it was. But that's just my personal feelings and experience with the song, I bet others have their own, completely different from mine or whatever Yorke might feel when listening to this same song. Radiohead does not do this by accident of course. In the song, [Like Spinning Plates](https://youtu.be/-UAElLsVOQI), Yorke intentionally learns to sing the song backwards, only because he thought the vocals sounded a lot better that way. And then he inverted his reversed vocals to play normally again, thus achieving the dream-like, hallucinogenic and stream-of-subconsciousness-esque sound that we now hear in that track. I understand that this approach to vocals, and lyrics, may not be for everyone. But for me at least, I really appreciate how formless his vocals can be. And this allows for me to connect with their songs to a much deeper and personal level, something that I only previously had with instrumental music, or songs in languages I did not understand. There seems to be so much limitless potential when vocals are treated just like any other instrument: amorphous and yet so much viscerally meaningful.","To me, Yorke really utilizes his vocals as an instrument to his fullest extent.  Even without lyrics (or the very legato and cryptic lyrics that Radiohead is known for), you can portray so much emotion and meaning with your voice, and he is able to take advantage of that much more than other vocalists I have listened to.  Even as early as Kid A, he explored using vocoders and digital synthesis to create an even more entrancing atmosphere.  Gotta be one of my favorite vocalists, despite me not knowing what he‚Äôs singing half the time.",119

However, it was Mike Chapman, the producer, who turned it into 'Heart of Glass' and made the song a global smash hit. Joy Division's early work was run-of-the-mill indie. Martin Hannett, Factory's in-house producer, took the original studio tapes and returned 2 days later with the stripped down, raw tracks that became ""Transmission"", turning the band into icons Lots of bands could be writing great songs. But so often in musical history, it's the producer who takes the artist's original vision and turns it up to 11. And no, I'm not a producer :)","Unpopular opinion, the jangle riff on Once I Had A Love is better than Heart of Glass. Heart of Glass is a favorite. But hearing the non over produced version was a breath of fresh air. I think what you are saying doesnt work for every band, capturing a sound as close to raw live performances as possible for The Stooges on their Funhouse album was better for the band.  Another example of songs becoming OVER produced is all the Smashing Pumpkins demos. Billy wrote some beautiful songs on piano, with minimal production on the album Adore. And when you compare the demos to the over produced sound, the demos sound amazing and heartfelt.",164
ltl65i,"I personally find heavy enjoyment in highly dissonant music (such as Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica. It's one of my favorite records.) and have found others who experienced the same thing. For some, like me, it was acquired over a long period of time. I started getting into heavier music when I was about 11, and now at 18 I derive the same enjoyment from dissonance that I would get from a beautiful melody or chord progression. I can still hear and identify things as being dissonant to an extent, but it's definitely blunted compared to how it used to be. A tritone without it being appropriate as part of a chord progression used to be able to make me cringe, but I don't really hear it as that dissonant anymore. I'm not remotely tone deaf, I have pretty good pitch perception. I think I just conditioned myself to hear it just like any other music. I like lots of music that's more orthodox in its notation and structure, but I've always found myself drawn to the avant-garde too. I plan to absorb as much music as I can before I die, regardless of boundaries or barriers.","There was a similar thread some months back regarding noise music and a comment I made seemed to resonate with people. If I may recycle it -  > There is a passage from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that feels relevant to this question. It describes a room that gives an incredible impression of infinity because the walls are so massive; however, they are neither planar nor infinite because they curve and meet at some point, yet they give a better impression of infinity than infinity does because real infinity is boring and featureless. I feel as if noise in music is similar to that. Well constructed noise and dissonance provides a facsimile of absolute chaos and disorder in a way that is intriguing precisely because it manages to be close to that boundary without becoming that boring extreme. It is most definitely an acquired taste, but much as Tolstoy said, ""all happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,"" I feel there is a similar analog to music, in that all consonant music is pleasing in a similar way while dissonant music carries with it a unique experience unlike other seemingly equally dissonant music. I think there is something to be said about the difficulty it takes to make a pleasing, dissonant track compared to a harmonious one as well. Whereas the latter is more readily primed to please our biology, the former requires a little bit of biological finessing - all of which goes to explaining the general trend of popularity for the one rather than the other. Especially when it comes to maximalist sound, it can be somewhat exhausting by design, actively flooding your attention channels as opposed to a charting pop ballad that delivers the same four chords you know and love with not an acoustic hair out of place to set your system on edge. To also use a food analogy, I think of pop music as fast food. It delivers a massive does of salt and fat which your brain rewards you for consuming and you don't quickly tire of it with the downside being that the simple and replicatable flavor doesn't often provide particularly memorable experiences. But something like Trout Replica Mask is massive and decadent, like a several course meal with many exotic flavors - an experience I treasure but seldom indulge in because of its sheer weight and feeling like my body needs a refractory period to enjoy again. Not saying one is better than the other by any definition of things. Just what you are craving at the moment. Some people do not like to be adventurous with their food but still enjoy a very satisfactory and healthy diet while other people believe they cannot enjoy a plain grilled cheese sandwich if there are not several types of cheeses and foreign jams in it.",251
lunrxw,"It's very common to see people disliking a musician because they are too simple, or basic, or safe. But I would argue that there is an art form in itself of making art that people are comfortable with. Not everything has to be genre bending to be good. As long as the art understands that it isn't complicated I think 'safe' art can be good. Take Billy Joel for instance. Nothing he did was particularly influential, and nothing he did was particularly unique, but he was good at being simple. He knows how to make a great melody and run with it, without doing anything spectacular, and that's fine as long as it doesn't pretend to be unique. And there are many artist like this, just billy joel was the first to call me to mind. I read an article that put it this way:  sometimes we want fine dining, like a nice filet mignon or salmon, but sometimes we really want a hotdog, and as long as we want it to be a hotdog, then it's fine that it's not a steak. I honestly don't know most people's opinion on this statement, and I was just wondering if people agree or disagree. I was a little modest about billy Joel here because I myself am definitely a fan. I could probably sing the stranger album front to back.","This leads to a very interesting conversation on what was once original and cutting edge can become safe over the years. Pearl Jam is a great example of a band who was (mostly) original in their time, but their music was so influential it lead to a large number of milquetoast knockoffs in the late 90s/early aughts that made their music feel safe (even if the continued to innovate).",164

lw7vyn," I should preface this by saying that, obviously it's up to you to explore new music for yourself. That said, growing up being told that only one genre of music is good gets in your head and influences how far you search.  So, like many here, I grew up in a household filled with ‚Äúdad rock,‚Äù which is the blanket term for popular 60‚Äôs-80‚Äôs rock classics. AC/DC, Zeppelin, Queen, The Eagles, Journey, Van Halen, etc.   Now, I should preface this by saying, on one hand, I‚Äôm *glad* my parents listened to that stuff. Classic rock is, and will continue to be, my favorite genre ever. Powerage by AC/DC? Zeppelin II? Van Halen S/T? Boston S/T? Hard to beat.

I missed out on Judas Priest, and Iron Maiden. The Misfits and Black Flag. Alice In Chains. The Temptations, WAR, any rap whatsoever. So many genres, artists, and songs I missed out on.

lx0bzl,"I just found out the soundcloud rapper ""6 dogs"" died a month ago. I didn't even realize it until googling him today trying to find new material since a few of his songs were stuck in my head. 6 dogs was among my favorites of the new gen z crop of rappers; he was 21-years old and now he's dead. Jim Jones (rapper not cult leader) once said being a rapper was the most dangerous job in the world. While that statement is definitely hyperbolic, the mortality rate of rappers has always been disturbingly high compared to other genres. Just looking at my spotify hip hop playlist, and good chunk of guys are dead now... Everyone from Nipsey Hussle, Mac Miller, MF Doom, 2PAC & Biggie; to the emo-rap scene like Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, Juice Wrld, Slutty Sonny, Hella Sketchy, 6 Dogs; to the drill rappers like L'A Capone, King Von, Capo, Young Pappy, Lil Jojo, Fredo Santana, Pop Smoke. What's sad is how young these guys all were. Aside from Nispey & Doom, everyone here was either in their 20's or a teenager. Sad....   Do you think it's mostly a matter of them trying to live up to the image of what fans expect of them? I mean some of them are just deeply troubled & grow up in a life of crime (like the drill guys), but a lot of these deaths are drug overdoses as well.

lyg95q,"Wes Montgomery is one of my all-time favorite guitarists. I love his eccentric and wonderful style of playing, using his dexterous thumb rather than a guitar pick, octaves galore and generally eschewing showy riffs and solos, and even to this day when so many fine musicians have been influenced by him (Eric Johnson, Bobby Broom and Pat Martino to name but a few) he still sounds utterly unique. Despite being very prolific, especially considering how young he was when he died, I feel as do many people only really know him for Incredible Jazz Guitar. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs an amazing record, but it‚Äôs barely the tip of the Montgomery iceberg; Full House, Smoking at the Half Note, So Much Guitar, Boss Guitar, not to mention the collaborations Bags meets Wes, Jimmy and Wes are all must-listen albums.","What makes him Boss Guitar imo: Jazz guitar during his time used basically no effects, distortion, capos, gadgets whatever. It was just the guitar, the amp and the person with maybe a pick (or half a pick, [Joe])in between. As an instrument that basically had a limited dynamic range - I mean, it‚Äôs hard to control the volume in a nuanced way while you‚Äôre playing, at least before volume pedals - Wes distinguished himself by being able to ‚Äòbuild‚Äô a solo.  Starts with single notes, moves to octaves and ends big with chords. It was technically impressive that he could be so nimble with the octaves and so melodic with the chords. If not, the solos would have been messy and hard to follow - he never lost the melodic thread that made it an improvised solo - even while building it up.  So in that sense, combined with the distinctive thumb-tone, Wes was very much a textural player. Which is to say, his playing is very easy to *feel*. And that quality to me (in addition to his many fine music fundamentals) is was makes him so unique.  Add to that his self-taught approach and basically little to no knowledge of theory, and you have this wonderful, fresh perspective in the instrument and the style.  Anyways, I‚Äôm blabbing.",57
lz4owc,"As of March 6th 2021, [Bryter Layter](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quietus_production/images/articles/12194/nice_drake_bryter_layer_1367935703.jpg) will be celebrating it's 50th anniversary.  The second album released by Nick Drake on March 6th 1971, this album was meant to give Nick Drake a more accessible sound after the low sales of his debut [""Five Leaves Left""](https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/five-leaves-left-nick-drake.jpg). The record used extra instrumentation by musicians like ex-Velvet Underground member John Cale and members of folk rock band Fairport Convention. This album tried to give Nick a commercially appealing sound, but on release, it suffered the same fate as Nick's debut, only selling around 5000 copies on its initial release and receiving mixed reviews in the music press. Nick would ultimately end up stripping the sound of his music and would employ his minimal instrumentation on his third and final album, [Pink Moon](https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nick-Drake-Pink-Moon-Album-Cover-web-optimised-820.jpg). Ultimately, I would say that I love this album for what it is. Songs like [Northern Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBBkFWXiL9Q) and [One of these Things First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDtsgVgAx6k) gives the album a very nice and mellow sound, while others like [Poor Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLJFSj3b4q0) and [At the Chime of a City Clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qlNDTfecGY) employ a jazzier sound compared to Nick's previous work. Overall, I think Bryter Layter is my personal favorite album by Nick Drake. What do you think about the legacy of Bryter Layter as it reaches its 50th anniversary and the sound that Nick employed on the album? What do you think of the songs that are offered on the album? Do you think it should have been more successful than it actually was at release (I sure think so)? Also, why did they not release Northern Sky as a single, which Nick believed could be a hit?","I was mildly obsessed with this album last fall. For my own part, I think the extra instrumentation works to this album's advantage. I find the arrangements lush and engaging without smothering Drake's compositions. And the great lyricism that people celebrate in _Pink Moon_ is also present on _Bryter Layter_. I'm not prepared to explain the economics of the 1971 music business or why this didn't hit, or why it's still a less recognized album than _Pink Moon_. But I can definitely endorse this album, it's worth everyone's time.",56
m0e2e5,"You know as well as I do: the Vietnam War had a profound influence on the music of the 60s and 70s, and produced innumerable songs protesting the conflict and the concept of war in general. Hell, some songs ended becoming anti-war anthems based on the context alone (contrary to popular belief, CCR's ""Run Through the Jungle"" was about gun ownership in the US, not Vietnam). Some tracks became iconic (""War"" by Edwin Starr, ""Give Peace a Chance""); most faded into history. ""Gimme Shelter"" is, of course, in the former category, but for me it's beyond that. It's the piece de restitance of the peace and resistance era (sorry...). See, there are plenty of songs that capture the grief and misery of war, or that righteously sneer down war mongering madmen- but this is one of the only songs I know that perfectly captures the fear and terror of war. That ominous opening riff sets the tone before Mick Jagger goes into a narrative that makes choices both obvious and daring: present tense, first person, from the perspective of someone actually in a warzone. Interestingly, his narrator doesn't appear to be a soldier, but rather a civilian swept up in the conflict. In lesser songwriters' hands, this would all be too on the nose: but Jagger/Richards wisely add a level of ambiguity by utilising natural disasters as metaphor (""storm"", ""fire"", ""flood"") for the subject in question. Then there's the chorus, where they let loose the song's message: peace is delicate, a mere ""shot away"", the horror of which is shared by Jagger and Merry Clayton in their wailing vocals. But it's the bridge, wisely left to Clayton alone, that really illustrates the true cost of war, bluntly stated: ""rape, murder"". These are the inevitable terrors that come with war, no matter how righteous the cause. It's a beautiful sneer to anyone who would dare try to act like war is somehow valiant*. And then, the outro, a rare moment of sincere tenderness from a band who built themselves on gruff sexuality: ""love is just a kiss away"". It's simple and somehow beautiful, offering a glimmer of hope. I find a lot of 60s hippie-dippie-love-is-all-you-need utopianism fairly saccharine: this makes love sound real, simple and essential. Oh yeah, and the drumming on this track is phenomenal. Charlie Watts kicks arse.  What are your guys' perspectives on ""Gimme Shelter""? A penny for your thoughts? *This is not to say that war is never necessary, but even a war fought for all the right reasons won't be glorious or beautiful: it'll be filled with horror and terror.","Good stuff here. Listening to the chorus chokes me up from time to time because Merry Clayton, called from her bed in the middle of the night by Mick Jagger, recorded this unbelievable performance in the middle of a pregnancy. The day after the session she miscarried. Listen to the isolated vocals. If that last voice crack doesn‚Äôt knock you out, check your pulse.  https://youtu.be/njAuEGRthuw",111
m1gsxx,"I am 34 years old and grew up in the era of nu-metal, but as teenager I never really gave Deftones a chance. Compared to their contemporaries of the time, they were slower, less aggressive, less commercially friendly than say, Korn or Limp Bizkit. You never really saw Deftones on MTV, and they didn't cultivate a distinct image like Marilyn Manson or Rob Zombie, so when all of this is taken into consideration I can see why I didn't appreciate them back then as a kid.  Lately I've had too much time on my hands and on a whim decided to dive into the Deftone's discography. I went down this hole partly because I knew that these guys have a devoted fan base, but also because nu-metal is something of a guilty pleasure for me, even if I have grown out of much of what I liked back then.  Once nu-metal fell from fashion, it felt like many of the bands became the butt end of a joke as they clung to their cartoonish images trying to stay relevant. Deftones on the other hand stood apart, their sound and their image always felt more authentic and true, and they never really fit nicely into that box of being a nu-metal despite having some similarities.  Musically, they have much more to offer. Admittedly I have a lot more I need to check out, but throughout my repeated spins of White Pony, there are layers and I feel like I'm picking up something different each listen. The riffs, the drumming, the vocals all come together in away that creates a sound that is atmospheric. You can't create music like this without having heart and passion in it.  Can't believe I waited this long to give Deftones a proper listen. These guys stood the test of time much better than most bands of the era.",I recently went back on a deep dive and they‚Äôre probably the only band of the era I‚Äôll still listen to. I had ‚ÄòMinerva‚Äô from their self-titled album on earlier today and definitely has a bigger shoegaze influence that their earlier stuff; the track absolutely rocks,110
m248md,"I have now listened to Vulfpeck‚Äôs entire discography, consisting of 4 EPs, 5 studio albums, and 1 live album.  Vulfpeck is a funk band at its core, but I think it‚Äôs what many people would describe as a more ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù kind of funk. There‚Äôs really not a whole lot of boundary-pushing experimentation going on, but what there is a lot of on their best releases is pure groove. The band absolutely exudes effortless technical skill without coming off as flashy or pretentious. Each member is undeniably talented at their instrument(s) of choice, which results in many songs feeling meticulously crafted despite basically of their tracks being single-take, simultaneous recordings with a decent amount of improvisation. Also, Joe Dart is one of the best funk/soul bassists working today, possibly ever.  The band‚Äôs studio output can be divided into two pretty distinct sections: the EP era (2011-2014) and the album era (2015-present). In my opinion, Vulfpeck‚Äôs EPs are far more successful as full releases than their albums are. Each EP is a rock solid batch of endlessly enjoyable grooves, purely embodying the initial mission of the band: ‚Äúto channel the era of the live rhythm section.‚Äù [*Fugue State*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tsdb5Wp4fg) is my favorite of that initial run, packing in lots of creativity and displaying a laser-focused vision for its sound not quite matched by its predecessors. Only two vocal songs (""[Wait For The Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4G0nbpLySI),"" ""[1612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRHQPG1xd9o)"") appear in the entire EP era, both sung by friend-of-the-band Antwaun Stanley. They are two of the band‚Äôs best vocal features and they fit in perfectly with the surrounding instrumental songs. Unfortunately, the album era is a lot less consistent. While many of my favorite individual Vulfpeck songs come from their studio albums, none of the LPs truly achieve greatness as wholistic units. [*The Beautiful Game*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRdnpKRvMwI) comes the closest, containing some absolute masterpieces (‚Äú[Dean Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le0BLAEO93g),‚Äù ‚Äú[Cory Wong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWBUnr0F3Zo)‚Äù), but just one or two major clunkers keep it from reaching its full potential. [*Thrill of the Arts*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJIFJ-L-Lw8), [*Mr. Finish Line*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3T8d50jzTk), and [*Hill Climber*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m-5FQFWcnqCePmBT-OWvh_1IfpGWsLdLs) provide some great individual tunes, but fall short for similar reasons. Their most recent album, [*The Joy of Music, The Job of Real Estate*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyazpcqi0slFXy4itCF3O8NVXI2TcnQbK), is certainly the worst of the bunch, its one or two highlights overshadowed by some of the band‚Äôs most lifeless performances, feeling haphazardly slapped together just to get something out during quarantine.  Vulfpeck is primarily an instrumental band, but every album has its fair share of vocal tunes, typically coming from the same few collaborators. Stanley‚Äôs vocal features are consistently enthralling across the whole discography. Tracks showcasing other vocalists are a mix of delightfully tasteful performances of fun pop melodies (‚Äú[Back Pocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG96RttfZtM),‚Äù ‚Äú[Animal Spirits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTUnDV3MgVQ)‚Äù) and mountainous piles of extreme camp that can be tough to endure (‚Äú[Darwin Derby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrdsotPDrRg),‚Äù ‚Äú[Conscious Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqBOzFqpZzM)‚Äù). I would say that Vulfpeck is definitely a ‚Äúsong band‚Äù rather than an ‚Äúalbum band,‚Äù and I think that purely in terms of studio output that‚Äôs true. However, I think the real truth lies in a totally separate distinction: Vulfpeck is absolutely, one hundred percent a *live performance band*. This brings us to the final piece in their discography puzzle, and the one I think is by far their greatest success, 2019‚Äôs [*Live At Madison Square Garden*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv4wf7bzfFE). This performance truly showcases how transcendent Vulfpeck can be when experienced live. Overflowing with energy, groove, and pure joy, the live album comprises stellar performances of nearly all of the best songs from their entire catalog and exhibits almost their entire cast of touring and studio collaborators. It also vastly improves lots of songs that I didn‚Äôt care for in the studio, making the whole performance - whether you listen to the live album or watch the one-shot concert film - inspiring and infectious from start to finish. Too bad I discovered them in 2020. Final thoughts: The exhilarating jubilance of their live album/concert film, the pure tightness and groove of the EP era, and the occasional moments of greatness sprinkled throughout their album era are well worth the somewhat tedious task of sifting through a decent amount of sludge left in their wake.","Vulfpeck is my ""feel good"" band, and that Live album is pure bliss. They have the feel of a group that absolutely loves making music.  They sound like they're always having a blast.  Case in point: many of those single take tracks on their albums end in them cheering and congratulating each other on a great take.",117
m2ppw7,"I‚Äôve never understood why people say ‚Äúhe fell off‚Äù when a band or artist tries to challenge themselves and goes for a new type of sound.  Unless you‚Äôre Drake, no one can continue to make the same exact album for 10 years straight and be satisfied with themselves. Progressing is about being uncomfortable and challenging yourself in new areas. I‚Äôve seen it in a ton of bands or artists who get flack for doing something new like Mac Miller‚Äôs Divine Feminine, Green Day‚Äôs Warning, All time Low‚Äôa The Last Young Renegade or even Billy Joel‚Äôs Innocent Man.  I think the sign of a good artist is to be diverse and continue to grow. This doesn‚Äôt mean you abandon your original sound but I just think bands are allowed to have an album or two where they change it up without getting scalded for it.","People don't say ""s/he fell off"" because their favourite artist is pursuing a new sound; they say ""s/he fell off"" because they don't like the new music the artist is producing. You hear that phrase used just as often when an artist hasn't changed their sound significantly at all and people just don't like their newer work. I agree that artists should be free to grow and change (so do most people here, I'd expect) but that doesn't mean their fans are obliged to like whatever music they make.",292
m3fy30,"EDIT: Thank you to everyone who is commenting and awarding this post! Also, thank you for keeping me company by sharing my greatest love (music) with me during my now year quarantined in Miami.  I am a singer and have an affinity for amazing vocal talent in music, as I find many artists do with their particular focus. Jeff Buckley has long been the name I give when asked for my favorite singer (male, Whitney Houston far and away for female.)  I believe many have sorely missed out on experiencing the incredible raw talent and vocal prowess of Buckley, having only often heard his rendition of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah.""   I am in love with the Grace album. I often use it to practice my own range and skill, always blown away by the beauty and complexity of the melodies.  How does everyone else feel about Jeff Buckley? What are your thoughts on his voice, melodies, lyrics, guitar playing? Have you heard his original music?","Personally I think live at sin-e is amazing. So much to like here. I'm not a huge fan of his songwriting but his cover choices and renditions are spot on. His guitar tone is perfect ( yea,yea I know) and his playing is beautiful. Rare talent that never got the chance to be fully honed. RIP taken too early",125
m4d8ro,"Lauryn Hill has had one of the strangest careers in modern music. Back in the late 90‚Äôs it seemed all but obvious that she was going to enjoy a long fruitful career, with her solo debut The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill being immediately hailed as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time and also receiving a fair share of praise as a member of the Fugees, not to mention successful collaborations with Aretha Franklin, Nas and Santana among others. And yet since then, apart from a poorly received live album (though it must be said it has some strong defenders), she has released no music and become more famous for her erratic behavior. Shame, since she has shown to be so talented, especially since she has maintained such an immense influence on this century‚Äôs music. Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Beyonc√©, The Weeknd, Rihanna, Amy Winehouse, Drake, Freddie Gibbs and Adele to name but a few all have followed on her footsteps. Personally I really like Hill. There is something I find very joyous and spiritual about her work, even when she‚Äôs rapping about difficult issues, there are very artists who have managed to deal so perfectly with issues of love and spirituality. Although a rapper I find her in many ways to be a spiritual successor to the great soul singers of the 60s and 70s, artists like Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Stevie Wonder.","‚ÄòThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill‚Äô is hands down my favorite album ever. My mom owned this album when I was little and it really inspired me to write music, because every single song is musical poetry (Lauryn talks about how when she writes music, it usually comes in the form of a poem first). ‚ÄúEx-Factor‚Äù is my favorite song ever, it speaks to me that no other song has ever. You can literally hear the pain in her voice while she‚Äôs singing it, it‚Äôs genius. Honorable mentions to ‚ÄúTell Him‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo Zion‚Äù, ‚ÄúI Used to Love Him‚Äù and her cover of ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Take My Eyes Off of You‚Äù. Every song on that album is so different lyrically and musically, and no subject is off-limit on there. Her MTV Unplugged album is also amazing, I‚Äôm sad it didn‚Äôt get the recognition that her first album did. I can see why she felt overwhelmed with the whole association with fame. It‚Äôs not something she strived for, all she wanted was to be an authentic artist and get her message across. She is a musical genius and anything she touches, in my opinion, is fantastic.",111
m4s6ve,"So this is sort of an outing i think. I know most people use streaming services like Spotify, Deezer or Tidal nowadays. But I don't! And yet i am none of those vinyl freaks and audiopiliots \*cough\* i mean, elitist nerds. I am just... still  living like in 2007 or so. I still prefer to have local files. I don't care if it is mp3, m4a, ogg, flac or whatever, i don't hear the difference anyways. I also don't mind if the source is legal or illegal tbh. But the thing is i prefer files. The Tagging. I absolutely hate I cannot edit tags and albumarts in Spotify, Deezer and so on! tbh i think streaming lacks a lot of features. I can't leave a note-comment in a song. I cannot cut or edit them like i did to many mp3s. I also love Foobar on Pc and Playerpro on my phone with all their great features. There is no streaming App that can even compare to them. Also i don't have mobile internet and i also don't need it. I am happy with having my wifi at home. I'd hate if i have to re download every playlist when i need it, and when I'm not home i am limited to what is on those downloaded playlists. I hate there is no streaming service that also lets you play local files. Yes, its easy and convineant, i get why people use it. But it just leaves me so unsatisfyed. It does not give me all i like about having files, it's way too basic. And the sad thing is, streaming could be so much more. Not only than what it is, but also than what the benefits in my local library are. Spotify stopped piracy they say. At least for me it still is not enough. I'ts very great to discover new stuff, which is a thing i like to use it for, yes. But I go download that discovered music somwhere else to have all the benefits of a local file collection and my preferred players. Even though it takes a lot of effort to care for all the files on Pc and Phone. Also, many musicans i listen to are complete dicks and assholes i don't wanna even support. Same as with top mainstream artists that i'd also pay, even if i don't even stream them at all. There would be a ton of good solutuins. But as it still is right now, no thanks. I keep my library of 10K files! So, am I the only strange stuck in the past idiot who thinks like that and because of those specific reasons? I feel like something's wrong with me xD &#x200B; Edit: Thank you for all the upvotes and comments! I never thought this would get so much response!","I‚Äòm with you. For me the main reason ist that I absolutely want to be able to to listen to the music I listen to now when I‚Äôm 70. It will be such a nice ‚Äûtime travel‚Äú when meeting old friends, we can listen to the music we heard that time. In YouTube and Spotify the catalogue can always change, for me this is the reason I am still not happy with the comforts of modern streaming.",143

Who gives a shit Kurt Cobain didnt like it, it's his most popular song, and for good reason, its catchy! Why do people care so much? Is it just another classic example of music snobbery/gatekeeping?","It could be some snobbish BS but sometimes it is more a point of interest really.

m6caof,"I've been following Jeff Rosenstock's career since I was a teenager. While he's never been one to completely re-invent himself throughout his career, he's also never been one to rest on his laurels like some of his peers from within the ska-punk scene. This more iterative quality of evolution makes it feel like there's a throughline running throughout his 20 years of output, from his [snot-nosed ska-punk group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nPsRtK3Wk) to his [mid-career punk group which utilized a kitchen-sink method when it came to songwriting and instrumentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzaqM59M2-s) to his [more conventional, but more melancholic current work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADy223LhKag). While they're all noticeably different, they do feel like logical steps from each other. Lyrically, each band feels like a specific phase of his life, and each album feels like a collection of journals from one specific moment in that phase. His thoughts, his fears, his anxieties about each specific moment are unrelentingly poured out into every one of his songs, giving his work a quality not unlike Weezer's Pinkerton. His early career band, the Arrogant Sons of Bitches (especially their breakout album ""Three Cheers for Disappointment!""), has a catalogue that [primarily focuses on young adulthood and getting disillusioned by one's social situation and peers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hRHDfdpi0Y) His mid-career band, Bomb the Music Industry!, overall focuses on the general transition from young adulthood to regular adulthood, and all the anxieties that come with it. Their 2009 album SCRAMBLES specifically feels like it captures the manic-depressive energy of being in your mid-20s and feeling like a total loser. More positive, high energy songs like [It Shits!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssBDPSZKbYM) slowly shift into songs like [Fresh Attitude, Young Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aAxgZRNuFU) which, despite retaining the energy, explodes into more fearful lyrics like ""If you don't find someone to love now/you will die freezing cold and alone""; this energy ultimately breaks down into [Wednesday Night Drinkball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQTJZ-Oix7k), this slow acoustic ballad about feeling like absolute shit due to an increased period of unemployment. As Rosenstock approached his 30s, Bomb the Music Industry disbanded and he began a solo career. His first couple of albums focus on what one would expect a ~30 year old Rosenstock to write about - the anxieties of being approaching middle age and watching everything shift around you. This however leads to the album of his which has gotten the most positive press coverage, ""Worry"". While it starts out with songs that cover his usual personal anxieties, it suddenly transitions into Rosenstock's most outwardly looking project at that point. tying his personal anxieties to an America that he feels is rapidly deteriorating. [Festival Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5qjTzPeA1E) is about how difficult it feels to protest against a system that seems all-encompassing. [Wave Goodnight To Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7MPzv78cWs) is explicitly about watching your city gradually get shifted into something unrecognizable as a result of gentrification. While Rosenstock has never been one to shy away from politics, this project feels like it was his first one that was overtly political. Either because of this, because of the general quality of the songwriting, because it was his first album with somewhat significant label Polyvinyl, or because his reputation had been slowly building for over a decade at that point, Worry seemed like his breakout success, getting significant coverage from music press that up until that point, had mostly been ignoring his career. I think what helped his music stick with me personally throughout the years was the unrelenting honesty of it. While his songwriting is enjoyable, I think his lyrical openness and bluntness regarding his anxieties in life helped me relate to his music in an emotional capacity, and I think that was a huge part of his appeal. Another post on this subreddit that gave a post-mortem on Bomb the Music Industry's last show described the crowd as ""A collective of the world's average or below average adults, all united under a sweaty guy with a guitar"".  And that's of course not getting into the deliberately DIY nature of how he conducts business. While he currently is signed to Polyvinyl, he does simultaneously release his and others' music on his label ""Quote Unquote Records"", a donation based label that's been releasing music under a pay-what-you-want method for over a decade at this point.  What do y'all think of Rosenstock's discography? Are there any artists whom you feel have a similar ""Iterative"" quality in regards to how they've grown as songwriters?","My first band‚Äôs practice space was in a tiny room in Jeff‚Äôs house that his musical projects also practiced in. I came up in the Athens, Ga music scene for nearly a decade starting in 2006. The drummer in my first band also played in BTMI. Jeff is a cool, passionate guy, and I‚Äôve always been super impressed with his dedication and drive.",44
m6siu1,"I've been in circles of musicians and music lovers for  my whole young life, and I'm always surprised at how people follow and get into so many artists, or make playlists with tons of different bands, etc. I feel very different: all my new music listening is kind of like searching for the next ""thing"", and once I find the ""thing"", I listen to it obsessively. In the past 3 years, I've had two phases where I listened to one album--or even a few songs on those albums--as the majority of my music listening, each for almost a year. Similarly, I find myself lots of times only listening to acknowledged masterpieces, not because I don't think there's other good stuff out there, but simply because I can barely tolerate sifting through everything to find the great stuff. Sure, I can listen to anything as background music, but sitting down, putting on headphones and really listening? I'm really picky. Anyone else like this?","Nah. I feel I try to always embrace newness. That may seem weird because I tend to not to stray far from the mainstream but I think that also helps me keep up with current trends that others may dismiss. I do have favorite styles but part of the excitement of music, for me anyway,  is how it changes through the years",138
m7avz2,"   Soundtracks for the blind is an album by Swans, made in 1996. Though it is hard to define the sound of Swans, typically they fall under the categories of Post rock and Noise rock. Though a cohesive album, it is unique in that it compiles recordings from vastly different times, ranging from 1981 to 1996. These recordings include cassette loops, narratives, and multi-track recordings. Swans in general are an incomparable band, their music not held by any restraints. If there was a way for me to describe Soundtracks for the Blind it would be more modern art than conventional music. To explain why it is so great is difficult, but I think its useful to look at another beloved album which I consider to be ‚Äògreat‚Äô for similar reasons: Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. For me, it was never the individual songs in Dark Side of the Moon which made it a classic, it was the way in which Pink Floyd used non-musical sounds to add an amazing extra layer to the album. The bridge between tracks has never felt more natural, like the sounds of clocks at the start of Time, or the sound of Money *in Money.* As I said, though these tracks hold their own, the build up to the song was always the awesome part for me. This is why my favourite track is On The Run, a track that doesn‚Äôt have the normal sound of a song but uses sound to create a scenario in your head. So, how is this idea of music improvised in Soundtracks for the Blind? Well, tracks like I was a prisoner in your skull use atypical musical techniques to create this feeling of immersion and free imagination. The track starts off with a choir singing the same note octaves apart, layered over what could be a synth replicating orchestral strings. It sounds like ascendance, which is helped by the change in sound from the first track Red Velvet Corridor which features a simple synth loop, drawing you in to the cacophony of weird sounds you‚Äôre about to hear. It really is 2001 Space odyssey esc, but unlike Alex North, Swans do not need a Kubrick directed film to give you this sense of unworldliness. Throughout the track other sounds add to this Supernova, like that weird high-pitched noise which I won‚Äôt try to define myself, or the loop which sounds like some sort of robotic heartbeat. All these noises come together, creating a feeling unlike no other, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre listening to the sounds of another dimension where everything is different, but of course, this is only what *I myself* imagine from listening to the track, but that‚Äôs beauty of it. The abstract nature of these noises allows you to explore and think about what is given to you. Around halfway through the track, we take a weird turn. Some aggressive drums join in with the noise before drowning out everything else, only for the drums to be replaced by an atonal slide whistle solo, leading the way for undoubtedly the most interesting part of the song: a sample of a strange man speaking to someone we don‚Äôt hear. This man sounds like Heath Ledger‚Äôs joker, though his dialogue is much more non-sensical and weird than the Batman villain. Michael Gira seems to recognise this through the addition of a drone loop playing in the background, giving a pedestal of the sample‚Äôs madness through the music. This use of sampling is done on other tracks such as How they suffer, which has Gira‚Äôs father detailing his detached retina, or Jarboe‚Äôs mother talking about how she‚Äôs dealing with her old age. The fact that all 3 samples I have talked about are real is obvious but also amazing to me; the fact that only through the music do I find myself listening to these completely random people talking about things which don‚Äôt affect my life in any way, yet I am moved by these voices. I think it really shows the power of the millions of things in life we take for granted or don‚Äôt notice whatsoever, the fact that although I am just listening to what could be an ordinary American man in *I was a prisoner in your skull*, I feel like he‚Äôs coming from another world which I can only access through Soundtracks for the Blind. Therefore, the album‚Äôs name is rather perfect, since everyone who listens to album is blind to world that lives within it.",That last bit truly captures it for me. It's like you get a view into a completely different approach to life and its utterly fascinating. That weird view is made even better by the fact that the music accompanying the snapshots create an ambiance that perfectly matches the fucked up readings/lyrics. That was a fun read.,30
m7tr3t,"I recently discovered the 1961 song [Tossin' and Turnin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghFBvBmXv4E) by Bobby Lewis. It sounds amazing and a bit ahead of its time sonically but I can't find much information about the session other than that it was most likely recorded in New York in Fall 1960 and featured Jimmy Spruill and songwriter Ritchie Adams on guitar. We know so much about how the Beatles recorded down to which guitars they used on which songs and even more about the 1970-present era down to which variant of which pedal David Gilmour used on which Pink Floyd track, or the specific mics and equipment used on popular sessions, but we know so little about the sessions from when modern production was in its nascent stages. The bass and drums are extremely forward in this track to the point that the guitars are almost drowned out but that makes the record sound huge for the era. Given that this was almost certainly recorded with just two microphones (1 on Lewis and perhaps backing singers / 1 on the band), I'd love to know if that was deliberate choice in the mic placement or just a happy accident. And who are those amazing backing singers? The one woman's vibrato is amazing. Despite having a pretty wide range, the bass sounds fat and hugely compressed on all notes, most likely due to using flatwound strings and probably pushing whatever 30w or less tube amp was available at the time to its limit similar to early McCartney. The band is tight as hell and grooves super hard, a reminder of how good you had to be in the era before click tracks, multi-tracking, and lining takes up the grid.  I'd love to know every little detail about this session but instead am left to wonder and perhaps try to recreate based on general knowledge of how things were done at the time. Obviously this session doesn't have a modern level of fidelity but it's a killer, killer song that shows an amazing adaption of the available technology. It was #1 for 7 weeks and the top Billboard song of 1961 yet like a Homeric poem or early Gregorian chant its origins now lie shrouded in mystery. All of the people involved are most likely dead. Adams died in 2017 and Lewis just last year at 95.  For whatever reason this song really speaks to me from beyond the grave. It says people in 1961 wanted to get down and have a good time in much the same way we do, that they could groove out hard and dance their asses off despite lacking all the benefits of modern fidelity. If you're one of those people who discount pre-70's music because lacks modern fidelity, don't. Recorded music can tell us the way past people *felt* more so than any other medium and there are recordings with acceptable fidelity stretching back into the 19 teens and twenties. In an age when we're increasingly writing off the past due to not living up to contemporary standards, old records help prove that people then weren't so much different than ourselves.","Regarding your specific case, podcaster Andrew Hickey did a ten-minute Patreon-only episode on ""Tossin' and Turnin'"" in early August 2020.  Unfortunately that episode unsourced, and also spends time on Bobby Lewis' recording career prior to 1961.  The only extra detail I can glean from the podcast is that the sax bridge is performed by Frank Henry on baritone and King Curtis on the mouthpiece of a tenor. EDIT:  This discussion [http://www.45cat.com/record/451002us2](http://www.45cat.com/record/451002us2) brought me to a hard-panned stereo version [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uEPDEJbJu0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uEPDEJbJu0) .  I'm not an expert, but I think that tells us who *wasn't* sharing a mike.",56
m8bjun,"I recently noticed that this band is home to both some of the darkest and most abrasive songs in popular music, and some of the sweetest simple pop songs as well. I think this is one of the reasons that this band is so legendary and timeless. They had this huge range of sounds and styles. Very versatile band. Thats what some of the best bands are known. Being able to to push their own limits and be creative in different sound mediums. I think those two worlds met perfectly on the song Heroin. My favorite poppy songs of theirs are ‚Äúafter hours‚Äù, ‚ÄúStephanie says‚Äù, ‚Äúfemme fatale‚Äù, ‚Äúthere she goes again‚Äù. ‚ÄúSunday morning‚Äù ‚Äúill be your mirror‚Äù And my favorite noisy songs are ‚Äúsister ray‚Äù ‚Äúi heard her call my name‚Äù ‚ÄúEuropean son‚Äù","The scene that produced the Velvets is pretty complex.   In the early to mid-60's, artist Andy Warhol opened a huge studio in mid-Manhattan known as The Factory. It was ground zero for budding artists, musicians, and bohemians in general.   A correlation could be drawn between the East Coast and West Coast sixties scenes by comparing the Factory in New York to the Haight-Ashbury scene in San Francisco. While the hippies out West had Ken Kesey and the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Tests, you had the bohemians in the East with Warhol and his Exploding Plastic Inevitable (among many other projects). The Bay Area had the Grateful Dead as their house band providing the soundtrack for the era, the same could be said for the Velvet Underground in New York. For both bands, you didn't go to a concert so much as attend a performance. Similar to the shows the Merry Pranksters did with the Dead, Warhol's followers turned the performance into pure spectacle, bizarre light shows, projecting film footage on the band and the stage screen behind, random people performing onstage as the band provided the sonic boost.   The West Coast was well-known for the peace & love aesthetic with pot and LSD, the New York scene was decidedly more urban with a nihilistic bent and a penchant for harder drugs and booze, basically the anti-hippies. The atmosphere of these disparate scenes fueled the music which reflected the climate of their respective scenes admirably.   The Velvets were comparatively more erudite in their approach to songwriting. Lou Reed wrote poetry detailing a world of drag queens, drugs and drug dealers with music to provide an aural illustration. He was also skilled at producing some truly beautiful songs of romance and relationships that could closely be considered pop.   (Personally, I think that Nico's vocals ruin some of Reed's most stellar songwriting, but it may have been a different experience in a live setting). She was a German fashion model who Warhol insisted be a part of the act. Thankfully, she was only on that first album)   Their approach to music was minimalist, exploring sounds and textures and dynamics - sometimes at the expense of the listener - allowing the imagery of the lyrics to come through. It was difficult music then as some of it is now; it require patience and attention, but the pay-off - that is, once the listener ""gets it"" - is highly worthwhile.     They only produced three proper albums, with the fourth, *Loaded* mostly comprised of previously unreleased tracks, and they never had a hit. The line-up changed very little with Reed, John Cale, and Mo Tucker at the center.     The influence of the Velvet Underground cannot be overstated. They were the definition of ground-breaking in their sound, lyricism, and overall aesthetic. The statement ""Without the Velvet Underground, there would be no [insert artist here]"" is overwhelming in its number and scope.    The Velvet's albums, as with the early Grateful Dead recordings, may seem foreign, maybe a bit dated. But they provide a vivid snapshot of an era that still rumbles and informs us 50 years later.           Edit: I wasn't intending this to end up being the wall of text it is, but there it is.",103
m96qoq,"D‚ÄôAngelo is a legendary R&B Artist, songwriter, and producer. His album ‚ÄúVoodoo‚Äù is considered by many to be one of the best Contemporary R&B/Neo-Soul albums of all time. Songs like ‚ÄúSpanish Joint‚Äù and ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù really give me goosebumps and remind me of good memories of falling in love for the first time. Instead of deeply focusing on lyrics, he focused on his tenor voice just being another instrument that juxtaposed with the beautiful mash of funky bass and smooth drums. And it works beautifully and almost sounds like magic in your ears. He‚Äôs also famous for the music video for his song ‚ÄúUntitled (How Does it Feel)‚Äù where he stands naked, almost showing his private parts, doing various poses whilst singing his heart out. He was a big flirt for the ladies throughout his career.","I remember listening to Voodoo a while ago and not really getting it. I had written D‚ÄôAngelo off until recently, when I listened to Black Messiah on a whim and it absolutely blew my mind. The guy‚Äôs like a musical grandmaster! For me, D‚ÄôAngelos the only non-70s artist I can think of who really comes close to hitting the highs of classic 70s soul/funk. Idk what it is, but he‚Äôs incredible at reaching that epic fusion of groove and melody and straight-up weirdness. Tbh, as pop music gets more and more subtle and muted, it‚Äôs really nice to have someone like D‚ÄôAngelo who just believes in dazzling you. His songs just sound so rich and beautiful it‚Äôs insane.",151
m9u3jz,"Some background: My cousin, an incredibly talented guy dropped out of a top engineering school to start producing music and it‚Äôs been a really difficult journey for him and for the rest of us involved. I‚Äôve finally had some time to think about just how hard it is for someone to pursue their passion to be a creator with massive financial, personal potholes that can lead you astray and pretty much derail your life. I‚Äôd love to hear some of your experiences and share them with him to remind him that the future is bright and that there are many others out there like him who dare to dream differently. A few of the biggest issues we faced together: - Not being taken seriously unless you are signed. It seems that unless you are affiliated with a label or have some form of management / agency pushing your name around, it‚Äôs really hard for you to be appreciated as someone other than a ‚ÄúSoundCloud artist‚Äù - Money. Especially as sunk costs in the early days. Oh boy this is a big one - we had to spend thousands of $ to get the right equipment - laptop, mixer, keyboard, mic etc. and the date where you might earn your first $ is at an unknown point in the future.  - Exploitative business models of intermediaries. Any agent / label we spoke to said they had a standard deal - you get to keep 10% of sales. Surely this is ridiculous and profiteering off of someone else‚Äôs creativity?  I‚Äôm tired of a world where creators are treated as second class citizens when they are the only ones who dare to dream differently and go after something they truly love. It seems that everybody loves to consume content but no one pays any regard to the journey or the person behind that song or piece or writing or art. Surely there is a better way? I‚Äôd love to hear about your stories on how you support yourselves and sustain your creativity or any advice for creators out there who are just getting started. More power to creators ","There is an inherent dissonance between creativity and business. Music and any other kind of art is also an extremely competitive business, since you have to capture the public's attention over literally millions of other singing voices. Even if labels were super supportive and even if agencies weren't predatory, it would still be very very difficult to succeed.  In my completely non expert opinion, it seems that the best approach in today's world is to maintain it as a creative pursuit rather than business, until it takes off. Livestream, youtube, spotify, etc. are probably the best avenues because they have have made it easier than ever to get a public presence out there, but it still won't return enough money to live on until you have a decent following.  If you chase money you probably won't ever catch it, because that is an incompatible goal with trying to make the best music or content you can, and it will make you burn out unbelievably fast. Actually, chasing money is a bad idea 99% of the time for any career, because your focus is not on your product or service. Best of luck to your cousin, and if he starts or has a channel already, drop a link!",102

Get out there and start discussing!","Do you want to know something crazy? Six of Nina Simone's albums, albums with her most memorable and indelible material, were recorded in a two year period in 1964 and 1965, all produced (and many arranged) by Hal Mooney. Every album from *Nina Simone In Concert* (1964) to *Wild Is The Wind* (1966) was recorded in two years. *Nina Simone In Concert* was recorded live in 1964. The set ends with two wildly different moods: the lightly delivered, ribald, comedic ""Go Limp"" followed by the scorched Earth, rollicking (and, sure, also darkly comedic) ""Mississippi Goddam"" that receives laughter from its seated white audience that decreases as the song rolls out and the lyrics get more pointed and direct. 1964's *Broadway-Blues-Ballads* is not among my personal favorite Simone albums but has perennial fan faves ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" and ""See-Line Woman"". 1965's *I Put A Spell On You* is clearly the better album. Simone has a way of taking other people's songs and making them her own, it happens twice on this album with ""I Put A Spell On You"" and ""Feeling Good"", both of her versions are iconic. Can you even hear a version of ""Feeling Good"" in your head that doesn't mimick Simone's version? 1965's *Pastel Blues* opens and closes with two stunners: Simone's read of ""Be My Husband"" and Simone's arrangement of the traditional song ""Sinnerman"" that is supercharged by similar piano work to the piano on ""Mississippi Goddam"", insistent and unrelenting. These two songs are among Simone's best, gone is the visage of Broadway lights and in its place is a powerful, ancient force emerging from the Earth. In this way, *Let It All Out* feels like a step backwards with a couple of straight ahead Broadway standards (though also, notably, songs by Bob Dylan and a version of Simone great ""The Other Woman"" - though far from the best version). It's fascinating that 1966's *Wild Is The Wind* is a collection of odds and ends as it has retroactively gained status as one of her best albums. ""Four Women"" is possibly Simone's best original song, it's scope in storytelling and empathy is unmatched among the other songs she wrote. ""Lilac Wine"" and ""Black Is The Color Of My True Love's Hair"" are spine-tingling. ""Wild Is The Wind"" on this album is one of the best songs ever recorded (uh, check the username). It's one of those songs that feels like it could change the temperature, it could change the color of the sky. It's seven show stopping minutes, seven minutes you'll remember if it is your first time hearing it (go on and try, I'll wait). Of course she had thrilling work outside of this two year period, without a doubt. It's amazing that so many Earth shattering songs were recorded by one person in less than 24 months. I wonder if the engineers knew they were commiting classics to tape as they rolled. It's jarring to think one person had so much in them to give to begin with, much less that it poured out as it did for her.",70
mbss9x,"Always knew Kanye was a really good artist but I always held off from calling him a 'genius' cause I always saw four or five other dudes in his music creds in all his albums after LR. Just listened to Graduation for the umpteenth time and I realized Kanye solo produced Good Morning with hardly any samples (only one Elton John vocal I believe). He's definitely more than a beatmaker in my eyes now, I feel kinda embarrassed I ever downplayed his talent.","I honestly think Kanye is more concerned with making his ! music as great as it possibly can be, if he needs help from other people he'll take it every time for the sake of his art. Absolutely nothing wrong with that ofc, he's probably one of the best and most influential producers of the past two decades. If you're looking for some impressive solo production, Tyler, the Creator's Igor is entirely produced by Tyler and Tyler only.",160
mcfvhr,"Born in New York City, Gil Scott-Heron (1949-2011) is one of the most famous modern American poets and musicians of the late 20th century. His spoken-word poetry work is primarily rooted in American Soul, Blues, and Jazz. He is considered by many to be a pioneer in Rap and a very influential revolutionary for Black American justice and reform and for putting ‚Äúthe black experience‚Äù in perspective for many. He is famous for poems such as ‚ÄúWhitey on The Moon‚Äù where he describes the duality of American success where white people such as Neil Armstrong mastering space travel and the American failure of non-whites being poor and struggling to survive (‚Äúno hot water, no toilets, no lights, but whitey‚Äôs on the moon.‚Äù) He‚Äôs also famous for ‚ÄúThe Revolution Will Not Be Televised‚Äù where he describes the mockery of revolution being sponsored by companies and how the real truth and message of the revolution will never be shown to the ignorant (‚ÄúThe revolution will not be brought to you by the  Schaefer Award Theatre and will not star Natalie  Woods and Steve McQueen or Bullwinkle and Julia. The revolution will not give your mouth sex appeal. The revolution will not get rid of the nubs. The revolution will not make you look five pounds thinner, because the revolution will not be televised, Brother.‚Äù) These famous poems were speaking about the reality of America. The fake news and unfairness of it all.  Mr. Heron was not a rich man in money, he never truly was. He was shunned by many labels at first for his rawness, but he persevered through the thickness of it all in underground jazz clubs across New York City and through his collaboration with other jazz and blues artists such as Brian Jackson, it would make him rich in his ability to allow people to understand the pain and suffering in the world. One of his most famous pieces of work, ‚ÄúPieces of a Man‚Äù is where we saw his musician side come in. The album describes a unraveling, imaginary account of his own father with Funky Jazz and Blues was underlined between truth bombing lyrics of the twists and turns of life of going from the top of the kingdom to rock bottom. Songs like ‚ÄúHome is Where the Hatred is‚Äù and ‚ÄúSave the Children‚Äù juxtaposes depressing lyrics with funky bass and drums, which allows for the universality of this album. This album can be played in a lecture hall to describe struggle, but could also be played during a smoke session or in a jazz club due to its calming, nurturing music. Gil Scott-Heron‚Äôs legacy has continued on well beyond his death. Most famously, he‚Äôs been sampled by Kanye West on ‚ÄúMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy‚Äù in the song ‚ÄúWho Will Survive in America‚Äù but he has also been sampled by Jamie xx in a full album entitled ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre New Here.‚Äù A complete remix of Heron‚Äôs 2010 comeback album, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm New Here.‚Äù He‚Äôs also been sampled by other famous artists and producers including Tupac, Freddie Gibbs, Pro Era, and many, many more. One of the most important things about a musical artists legacy is if their work can outshine their physical being. And as unfortunate as it is that Gil Scott-Heron isn‚Äôt as famous as his words, it‚Äôs much more important that his words and music are on display for the world to see. Which I believe is what he truly wanted.","‚ÄúThe Revolution Will Not Be Televised‚Äù is an essential track for anybody. Maybe one of the earliest direct hip-hop inspirations before the genre took off a few years after. Just a classic.  ‚ÄúGun‚Äù is still a pretty fitting critique even 40+ years later. Great funky groove but somehow still light & easy listening despite its topic. ‚ÄúHome Is Where The Hatred Is‚Äù is one of the tracks sampled by Kanye. Dark and desperate but still a great song. Any fan of Bill Withers, Sly Stone, Curtis Mayfield, or James Brown should give Gil Scott-Heron a listen.",68
mdzkv4,"Like, why do you think it happens? One artist reaches the top of the world in a single then they don't even come up on best-of-the-year-lists. Some of them ranging from the 90s and beyond might not even go beyond 50k views for their one hit on YouTube. Conversely, some very well-known classics that came up everywhere on the radio (even now) turn out to not have been anywhere near the top of the charts at time of release? Why does this happen? How can popular opinion change so much throughout the years? How could people have ignored many classics at time of release? (And I'm not just talking about bands with cult following, a surprising big amount of super well known bands have maybe like one or maybe two top 1's at most)","There's a concept called [Pace Layers](https://longnow.org/seminars/02015/jan/27/pace-layers-thinking/) that can help think about why this happens. If you look at [a diagram](https://i1.wp.com/timkastelle.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pace_layering.jpg?w=591&ssl=1), the two layers that you are talking about are Fashion and Culture.  Fashion moves quickly and has a very weak effect.  So a Top 40 song might fit the moment it is released, but as fashion moves it gets lost.  Music isn't just Fashion, however.  There is a deeper layer for Culture, which is slower moving (so songs that have a longer cultural impact may not be fashionable when they were released) but has a stronger/longer effect.  It takes more time to reach a critical consensus, which often includes a generational effect: a song or band has poor sales or fits a niche market, but it influences others. An example would be a band like Gang of Four.  The original lineup had modest sales in the Punk/New Wave market, but no chart-topping sales.  But bands like Primus, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Rage Against the Machine were inspired by them and over the long term, they have been influential even if many people still haven't heard them directly.",197
mf9qxt,"Haroumi Hosono is arguably the most influential songwriter in the history of Japanese music. At the age of 73, he continues to be a prolific songwriter after over fifty years of creating groundbreaking music as a solo artist and with his band The Yellow Magic Orchestra.  His grandfather Masabumi Hosono, a civil servant was the only Japanese survivor of the RMS Titanic. Although his story received little attention at first, Masabumi Hosono and his family became targets of widespread scrutiny due to his decision to not sacrifice himself for other passengers. Even long after Masabumi's death in 1939, the Hosono family were subjected to condemnation and ostracization by the public. Haroumi Hosono was born and raised in Tokyo. In the late 1960s, Hosono became involved with Japan's psychedelic rock scene. Hosono formed The Apryl Fool with drummer Takashi Matsumoto and released their self-titled album in 1969. Hosono and Matsumoto then formed the folk rock group Happy End who's self-titled album was produced by Van Dyke Parks, known for his work with The Beach Boys. The album also featured members of the band Little Feat. After The Happy End disbanded, Hosono became involved with other bands playing tropical themed exotica music, jazz fusion, and an early form of electronic music utilizing synthesizers and drum machines. His solo debut album Hosono House was released in 1973 which included highly influential songs including Rock-A-Bye My Baby. Several more highly influential albums followed including Tropical Dandy, Bon Voyage co., Paraiso, Conchin Moon, and the techno album Philharmony. In 1978, Hosono formed the Yellow Magic Orchestra, a group who helped pioneer synthpop and J-Pop music. Throughout the following decades, Hosono expanded his career into creating film scores and video game music. Hosono has been higly influential to many indie musicians including Mac Demarco who has performed with and interviewed Hosono. Vampire Weekend sampled Hosono's 1984 song Talking on their single titled 2021.","The more you dig into Hosono's work, the more that you find that he's omnipresent in the Japanese music that is presently seen as cool in America. It's shocking. That one song in the movie *Lost In Translation*? Hosono wrote it (""Kaze wo Atsumete""). In addition to Apryl Fool, he was in the bands Happy End, Tin Pan Alley, and Makoto Kubota & The Sunset Gang, all before YMO was assembled (*by him* it should be noted). Americans are going to Japan to buy copies of *Sunshower* by Taeko Ohnuki? Hosono plays bass on it. He also plays bass on *Spacy* by Tatsuro Yamashita (and later collaborated on a full album, *Pacific*). He plays bass on Osamu Kitajima's epic 1974 psych rock album *Benzaiten*. He produced a new wave album with Sheena & The Rokkets, a comedy album with Snakeman Show, an R&B album with Testpattern, and an ambient album with Interior during 1981 and 1982 *while still recording and touring with YMO*. It's obscene how busy he was from 1969 up through the 90s. His input into Japanese music is incalculable. Though not technically a YMO album, Hosono's 1978 *Paraiso* is a YMO album in all but name (Sakamoto and Takahashi both appear on it and it's credited to ""Harry Hosono And The Yellow Magic Band""). It's also in my top 10 albums all time, every time I hear it there is another moment to love. It's a hard album to explain, kind of like a tropical pop album but with its own internal logic. It's also a clear bridge from Hosono's solo work and *Yellow Magic Orchestra*. *Tropical Dandy* and *Bon Voyage Co.* both have a similar idiosyncratic tropical theme that lead directly into YMO's first official single (""Tong Poo"" / ""Firecracker"" titled *Special DJ Copy* in 1978). If you are a fan of YMO and haven't heard *Paraiso*, I suggest it highly. YMO are often reductively seen as Japan's Kraftwerk. The breadth of genres on *Paraiso* shows that this is definitely not the case.",28

mh1f16,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they're underrated. Everyone respects them, it's just that I don't think it's for the right reasons. Most people think of the Who as that band with a crazy drummer and instruments smashing without realizing how influential and innovative they were. To me it's like discussing Brian Wilson but talking more about his falsetto than his songwriting/producing I'll list some of their accomplishments, just right off the top of my head: 1. One of the first genuinely loud, powerful hard rock bands. Most people point to Blue Cheer and Cream but The Who predated them by a few years 2. My Generation is a strong contender for the first, straight up punk rock song ever. There's an argument that title could be The Kinks' You Really Got Me or Louie, Louie, but imo they're more suited to the label of ""proto-punk"". Meaning, they were the roots of what will be punk, but if they were released during punk's heyday, it would not be called punk. I genuinely think My Generation would be called [punk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjN5uHRIcjM) if released today. 3. One of the first to utilized the synth as a rock instrument. It has been used before by rock bands but mostly for more experimental, psychedelic songs. THe Who used it for rock songs. IMO Baba O'Riley sounds like an 80s rock song.  For better or for worse, that song was the DNA of future stadium rock acts like Van Halen or Journey 4. Pete Townshend popularized the use of power chords aka the basic tool for any modern rock band. As well as feedback. He didn't use it as an intro gimmick like Ticket To Ride, but it was a genuine part of his live style. Before Hendrix and way before Sonic Youth and noise rock 5. Perhaps this should be labeled as 1a... The Who was the first to use Marshall stacks. John Entwistle requested it in order to hear himself against Keith Moon's drumming. Forever changing the sound and limit of live music 6. Speaking of John Entwistle, he was the pioneer of the ""lead"" bass sound in rock. Yes Paul McCartney had fun lines but he was still relatively traditional bassists, Entwistle was another beast. He took the instrument as far as it could go. Chris Squire, Geddy Lee, Les Claypool, Cliff Burton all owe their styles to him.  7. Bonus Entwistle fact: he was responsible for the first death growl ever. On the track Boris the Spider 8. The Who popularized the rock opera with Tommy. Concept albums were a thing before Tommy but that was the first to use a whole album to tell one story. Aside from the obvious rock operas that followed after them, you could make a case that albums with more loose story telling themes in it, like Kendrick's TPAB, owe something to The Who I'll add more but just these imo makes them an incredible innovative band. I think only The Beatles are the only rock band that's definitely more influential than them. The rest, I can make an argument for. In terms of influence, I'd say The Who are just below Beatles and are in the same level with Pink Floyd, Velvet Underground, Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath and Beach Boys","What I find really interesting is how they subverted the conventional rock band dynamic. Because Keith Moon's drumming was so wild and busy, he didn't really function as a proper timekeeper so Pete Townshend had to fulfil that role on the guitar, often just playing rhythm. This left John Entwistle free to play the bass as more of a lead instrument, playing these complex melodic lines all up and down the neck that make him more like a second guitarist. The bass and drums were usually leading the band while the guitar supported them, which is the complete inverse of how it usually works. I can't find it now but I remember reading a quote from Pete that was something like ""the way it worked in The Who was I played drums, John played lead guitar, and Keith was an orchestra"". You can hear this dynamic at work in The Real Me, which pretty much showcases each member at their absolute best",99
mhy2pn,"There has been a lot of discussion here about separating the art from the artist in the past, and I‚Äôm sure there will be still in the future. An artist creates an art, and then we can judge the art without consideration of who the artist was, but what if the artist is the art?  Greta Van Fleet are a band that formed in the town of Frankenmuth, Michigan, USA, in the year 2012, but you‚Äôd never know it just by listening to them. They sound straight out of the last 1960s-mid 1970s, so much so that you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking them for a London, England based hard rock group that formed in the late ‚Äò60s. [They‚Äôve even got the hair and clothes to match](https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/05/Greta-Van-Fleet-Christopher-Polk.jpg). Hell, even their singer is made to sound like a Steve Marriott or Robert Plant type.   Given all of this you would think that the band embraces their influences, and makes no effort to hide any of it. It is glaringly obvious to anyone who has heard or seen the band, there would be no use in them saying otherwise. And yet they do. They repeatedly claim that Led Zeppelin was not a major influence on them, or that their music has little in common with the work of Led Zeppelin, when it is clear for all to hear that it does. But Why?    The simple answer is that they just don‚Äôt like the comparison because they want to be seen as original, so they choose to downplay it, but that answer is boring so I‚Äôm going to ignore it. No, the real answer is that they say this because the band‚Äôs music is not their artistic output, the band itself is. Greta Van Fleet are not a Led Zeppelin knock off or facsimile, they are a parody. Such a parody acts as not only a scathing indictment of Led Zeppelin, but of the very origins of rock. So while it may seem absurd for them to deny their very clear Led Zeppelin influence, that is exactly what [Jimmy Page did](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/30/led-zeppelin-sued-dazed-and-confused) when talking about Jake Holmes (the guy who wrote, and was not credited for, Dazed and Confused), while then going onto claim that his ""riffs are pretty damn original.‚Äù. Page went even a step further having claimed not only to not have been inspired by Jake Holms, but claiming to have never heard him (despite the fact that Holmes opened for the Yardbirds and the band would go on to cover his song). Greta Van Fleet try to hide their blatantly obvious influences because that‚Äôs what Led Zeppelin did. They need to for the parody to work. While rock and roll itself has some roots in not properly crediting lesser known (often black) musicians, no band exemplifies this better than Led Zeppelin, which is why I believe they were chosen for the parody.        Furthermore, the band actually used their audience, and most importantly their critics, as a part of their artistic statement. They made the music they did knowing full well about the ire it would cause, as well as the inevitable comparisons. They used their critics to further their artistic statement. Showing the irony in them being lambasted for ripping off Led Zeppelin all the while Led Zeppelin hears cries of ‚Äúgreatest of all time‚Äù for ripping off a myriad of lesser-known artists. Greta Van Fleet were playing 4D chess while we were just playing checkers.  So Greta Van Fleet's actions off of the stage and outside of the studio are all a part of their art, which brings me to my next point; the band, while also being a parody of Led Zeppelin, is also commentary on the idea of separating the art from the artist. The band is singlehandedly showing that separating the art from the artist is not possible when the artist embodies the art that they create. To separate the art from the artists is to remove the context in which the piece was created.  This group of kids from Frankenmuth, Michigan, USA, have been making a deep and complex artistic statement the entire time, and it‚Äôs just gone over our heads.      So, now that you have (hopefully) read all that here is my question to you: What are your thoughts on the death of the author?","Yes, absolutely! But today is the only day I'll agree with you. Forreal, it would greatly humor me if they're just shitting us. I think it's a 1 in 1000 chance of that though",166
mihzmm,"I'd prefer to provide my own experience in the comments to avoid making this thread about me, so to speak, but there's a minimum length to meet so here it goes. I'm writing this post inspired primarily by my experience with the Smashing Pumpkins. They used to be, bar none, my favorite band ever. I own every pre-breakup album, b-side, and quite a few obscure bootleg tracks and demos, including some recordings of a young Billy Corgan serenading a journalist in a hotel room. I stopped listening to them for a while, and was surprised to find that I really didn't care for them when I recently gave them another listen. Mellon Collie was one of my favorite albums ever, but I now find a lot of the tracks extremely juvenile. Adore, Siamese Dream, and Gish have aged a bit better, but even then I'm surprised that I ever called them my favorite band. 1979 used to be my favorite song, but now I just think of it as a good song, but nothing more. Did I Pumpkin myself out by being a superfan, or did I just outgrow them? Today I find myself listening to 80s and 90s U2 far more than I would ever listen to the Pumpkins, and that's absolutely not something I would have said even five years ago. Some other artists I have always enjoyed the same amount. I liked Bjork as a kid and I like Bjork now.","Music is kind of like any food, if you eat it all the time no matter how much you love it you will get sick of it after a while.  I like to give things time off if i find myself not enjoying it fully then come back to it only when i really want to hear it.   I can wager youl eventually come back around to gish-what an incredible record..or not what the fuck do i know",271
mj5crt,"Black Sabbath recently released a remastered version of their album Vol. 4 from 1972. This is one of my favourite albums and I know it back to front, inside out. On my first listen, it sounds absolutely identical to the previous remaster from 2009, which in turn sounded pretty similar to the version that went before it. This is a familiar experience. It was the same with that hyped up full discography remaster that Led Zeppelin did a few years ago. I couldn't tell the difference at all, and in fact I'm struggling to think of any remasters that are a noticeable improvement over the original. Are remastered just a way to repackage old material and make more money from loyal fans? Are they only for audiophiles with high end equipment who will be able to tell the subtle differences? Has anyone heard a remastered album that they think sounds markedly better than the original?",can anyone recommend remasters that do sound different/better than original? (and you can actually hear it without gazilion dollar speakers),220
mjsxyh,"So recently I read somewhere that the last song to hit No 1 in the  billboard having a single songwriter credit is ""Perfect"", by Ed Sheeran.  If you'll notice , you'd see that nowadays their is almost no songs in  the charts which are written by a single person, also there are no major  singer-songwriters who are popular in the mainstream while writing  their own stuff entirely. The  closest we get to a singer songwriter is Taylor Swift who also has most of her work as collaborations nowadays , but still i think writes majority of  the stuff. Compared to the past  where every generation had a popular singer songwriter like Bob Dylan, , Bruce Springsteen, Kate Bush, Prince etc nowadays theirs literally none.  What do you think might be the reason for this, are singers who can  sing songs made by collaborations from multiple tried and tested  songwriters and producers more enticing than taking risk on new  singer-songwriters, or is it something else.?","Pop music has been written and produced by committee since at least the 1960s. Even when popular songs of the past had a single songwriter credit, there were often still significant artistic decisions being made by (for example) producers. You're comparing the charting music of today with the musicians we lionise from the past like Dylan and Springsteen, but Dylan and Springsteen were never chart-toppers. If you look at the songs that were actually popular in the '60s, they were produced in a way that probably didn't differ significantly (other than technologically) to those of today. Plus, one of the other reasons popular songs these days often have multiple songwriter credits is the proliferation of sampling. If a sample is sufficiently prominent in a song, then the original songwriters get credit for it even if they weren't in any way involved in the production process. Take Kanye West's *Stronger* \- it's credited to ""West, Bangalter, Homem-Christo & Birdsong"", but only one of those people was actually involved in producing the track itself - the other three are simply credited for their role in the original that was sampled. Kanye West's dual role as a producer and rapper (over which, you have to admit, he has a massive amount of creative control) isn't much different in my eyes to the singer-songwriters of the past even if he isn't legally recognised as the sole writer for his tracks.",129
mk4mla,"[Though admittedly comedic, this is what drew me to write this.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNDbmN2gxRa/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) It makes sense that with discussions about class inequality and privilege, people have been debating about this within music more and more. It never bothered me personally. Sure, a band like The Strokes all came from rich backgrounds, but *This is It* is such an incredible album: they could walk the walk beyond talking the talk. Miles Davis, John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Brian Jones, and Radiohead came from relatively comfortable backgrounds too, but their talent and dedication makes it superfluous in the grand scheme of things (in my eyes at least). You've had acts of ""nepotism"" (i.e. having famous parents) like the band Nelson (sons of Ricky Nelson), Gary Lewis and the Playboys (son of Jerry Lewis), and Dino, Desi, & Billy (Dean Martin, Desi Arnaz, and Lucille Ball). The last group I can see as being questionable, especially since I don't think they would've played on Ed Sullivan and used the best session musicians at the time without their parents connections...but no one talks about them. Meanwhile, Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson had a father who was a music publisher and record producer. Sure he might've helped them out initially via connections, but Brian Wilson was a god damn musical genius right? Just look at *Pet Sounds* for christ sake. Not only is the band's material still well regarded, some have been heavily reassessed as being forgotten masterpieces (√† la *Smile).* And we're still talking about the Beach Boys heavily to this day. If that's not proving yourself, I don't know what is. Still, I can understand someone feeling disgruntled about a majority of indie musicians coming from money, inadvertently propping up the idea that anyone can make it. I remember debating someone about this, using J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr as an example. The man has fronted and played guitar for one of the biggest indie guitar acts of the 80's and 90's and influenced a lot of people. The group worked hard, touring in a van living the SST lifestyle before singing to a major label (Warner Bros. I believe?) But J's dad is a dentist. Does that make him less indie? I didn't think so, but the person I was talking to said ""...kinda?"" Anyhow, it's something I've especially been thinking about recently, so I was curious to know what other music lovers on here made of it.","i mean i cant blame anyone for taking advantage of connections that they have. and like you said, it doesnt make musicians like Brian Wilson any less brilliant. i just feel bad about the Brian Wilsons of the world who aren‚Äôt gonna find success solely because they dont have the capital nor the connections to make that possible. god knows how much more brilliant music might exist if they did. but once again, cant blame the successful musicians for any of that.",419
mkqk6j,"[So since my Chemical Brothers thread got a lot more interaction than I thought it would (pretty happy about that, let's introduce another fairly well known electronic artist, Bonobo. Which is funny, because he's said he doesn't consider himself electronic, but most people do. I can see why he himself does not, though.](https://old.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/mjf9pt/lets_talk_the_chemical_brothers/)  There has been only one thread about Bonobo if search isn't wrong, and that was 4 years ago, a lot more activity now. He‚Äôs easily one of my favorite artists.  Bonobo is a single dude called Simon Green based in Los Angeles. His genre/style steadily sits in Trip Hop/Downtempo with some other influences, like Nu Jazz and World music. He collabs with several different artists and are all generally well regarded. He currently has 6 studio albums and 11 EPs. The albums are Animal Magic in 2000, Dial 'M' for Monkey in 2003, Days to Come in 2006, Black Sands in 2010, The North Borders in 2013, and Migration in 2017. Fans typically regard his 2010 album, Black Sands to be the best, but they are all fantastic. There are many reasons for this, but I think Black Sands was the perfect time of which his sound really started getting more and more fleshed out. People are waiting on a new album (including me), but I don't think it will be until next year or so. Every album he's done has been released on Ninja Tune, with exception of Animal Magic, which was released on Tru Thoughts, another fantastic label with a lot of artists I really like. The TL:DR is that he is fantastic, and Simon Green is one of the best acts out there if you like this kind of music in my opinion.  For Fans of: Trip Hop, upbeat/groovy type music, etc.  Sample tracks: [Bonobo - Know You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAg_vUC0UlQ)  [Bonobo - Jets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c44_OOHPF34)  [Bonobo - Break Apart ft.

mljryd,"Like, so many of them are drug or alchohol addicts, former drug or alchohol addicts, depressed or battle mental illness, have messy lives, no stable relationships (as far as we can say, not trying to generalize anything). Is there something abou artistry that pushes a person go into some strange, miserable way of living? A friend of mine who has worked with musicians said this: ""There has to be something seriously wrong with you if you want to be watched by hundreds od people why you sing/play. Especially if you are actually creative, and you share your internal, intimate pain with people who never saw you or you never saw in your life - that alone is enough to get diagnosed by a shrink"" I know the guy, he hates working with musicians for variety of reasons, most of them are justified, and i can feel a personal anymosity steeming from his answer, but i cant help myself but wonder - is he actually correct?

mm27qc,"Originating in Bristol, a medium sized port city in Southwest England, in the late 80s and early 90s; The Trip Hop scene went on to produce some of the best, most enduring albums of 90s and beyond.  From Massive Attack's Blue Lines to Portishead's Dummy and to Tricky's Maxinquaye and more, this underground scene emerging from England's West Country went on to influence acts as large as Gorillaz and Nine Inch Nails.  Tracks like Unfinished Symphony, Glory Box and Teardrop have gone on to permeate pop culture in the UK and beyond. In my opinion, of all the musical scenes to emerge out of Britain in the late 80s and 90s from Madchester to Brit Pop, it is Trip Hop that retains the highest level of cultural capital to date. Edit: a word","TripHop was one on the things I was into as a teenager that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE ELSE in my U.S. suburban world had heard of. Low key I think it is one the the most influential subgenres of all time.  Modern mainstream hiphop and pop (think Future, Kali Uchis, Lana del Rey) sounds more like Portishead than it does like anything Dr Dre ever produced.",79
mmytqh,"So I was reading on /r/vinyl a typical thread where someone has a Bluetooth turntable streaming to speakers, and everyone shits on them because it's not as good a sound as just using a streaming service/mp3/whatever.  Which, of course, is true.  But for me it begs the question, so what? I've gotten completely burned out on streaming. I've used Pandora for years, and without using the premium service, I'm getting bombarded with ads. I have an entire hard drive of digital music I've bought, ripped from CDs, and recorded from vinyl.  To that end, I've had to treat that collection safely. Backups, backups of backups, making sure nothing gets corrupted, making sure the original source (whether on Amazon or bandcamp or wherever) hasn't magically decided to deny me access. Hard drive storage, cloud storage, physical disc backups.  So I'm moving *back* to owning physical copies of music, even if it does sound worse. I've even started to buy CDs again. It just strikes me as so much simpler.  I'll put on a few records, use Bluetooth to a speaker in my garage, and work in my yard all day. When I'm done listening, I still have that physical copy, and it's not going to magically corrupt or disappear. I can share it with my friends who have turntables and CD players. The record has neat things like liner notes, artwork, and sometimes band merch. My money is going to a local independent record store instead of Pandora/Spotify.  At the same time, they're more expensive, sound worse, and require more storage.  Is this just moving backwards? A stupid attempt at retro nostalgia? Or simply sacrificing audio quality for a gimmick? Any thoughts?","I've been using streaming for almost a decade now, but for the first half of that time, I was still buying CD's. I got spotify premium when I became a freshman (good deals), but that's also the same time I bought a record player and vinyl albums. I remember laughing at myself as I walked to a record store because the Sonic Youth album I was hoping to get was the same one I was listening to via spotify as I was walking to get it. I find for me though, listening to a record is almost a whole ritual in itself. 9 out of 10 times I'm listening to spotify, I'm basically using it as a means of not sitting with silence. So I stream music when out in public, or maybe sometimes when I'm chilling in my room without a specific song or artist I want to hear. It's also nifty to hear albums right when they drop and to check out musical recommendations without buying it and realizing it's not for me. When I listen to vinyl, though I may sometimes play a record when finishing homework or ""chilling"", it's usually a pretty active experience. I'll listen to a record like how someone watches a movie: totally engaged as opposed to trying to do something else simultaneously. It feels like an ""event"". If an album I really like is on sale, I'll buy it on vinyl. If an interesting album is available on vinyl and NOT on streaming, that's an automatic buy as well (like the Nuggets compilation). I also usually buy albums at merch tables. I bought Dinosaur Jr's first album when I saw them live several years ago for example.",85
moqt2q,"We seem to get a weekly thread asking 'what happened to [genre]??' or 'what killed [genre]??' These mostly focus on rock or metal genres, such as grunge, punk, heavy metal or prog and I think it's worth establishing a thread on this because the answers to these questions are often the same regardless of genre. It's also a chance for us to agree with my sentiments here or make it genre specific on why certain genres lost its traction more than others. **Mainstream tastes constantly cycle genres** What is popular in the mainstream comes and goes. Yes, rock and grunge were big in the 90s but it's not a testament to the quality of modern rock or grunge that it's not in the mainstream. It's more something else has taken the limelight due to changing tastes and cultures.  This even applies to genres within a wider umbrella term. The bling era of Hip-Hop was huge in the early 2000s but with the rise of trap, very few people are lamenting 'what killed 2000s hip-hop??'. It just evolved and became the zeitgeist since the mid 2010s. All these genres are still around in some form, you just might not find it on mainstream radio but extending your platforms to those such as Bandcamp can make you realise a community certainly still exists. **Innovation & Creativity** A more nebulous point is if there's any link between innovation and relevancy. I think it's safe to assume that is a genre stays the exact same for a decade, people will get bored, especially for passive listeners. So is it really a surprise that we cycle in and out of genres when certain ones are highly resistant to change? Let's take prog rock for instance. In the 60s, there was an emphasis on psychedlia and transitioned into more technical jazz fusion from bands like King Crimson and Yes. As someone who followed that genre very closely in the 2000s with the rise of Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson, I can't help but feel like it's stuck in the past. Steven Wilson and Opeth, who are current pioneers of prog are quite literally creating mostly throwback styles of prog. How are you supposed to attract a large new audience if your genre is rooted in its past? It sounds dated which isn't a bad thing but it is for widespread appeal. And once again, in contrast to Hip-Hop, just in the last 10 years, we saw Trap absorb and recycle many old ideas, from Travis Scott's trippy, almost psychedelic vibe to the more recent wave of emo trap from Lil Xan, Juice WRLD etc. **My overall point here is when asking why x genre is dead, are you genuinely looking to see what new iteration the genre has to offer or are you simply asking why its older, more popular iteration isn't as popular now?** If you're asking the former, then of course a genre feels dead but it fails to realise the world has moved on and doing more of the same isn't going to capture the hearts of the newer audience. **Blinding Lights** Blinding Lights was the biggest song in 2020 and probably in recent memory and it takes strong influence from 80s pop. Could you have guessed an 80s pop aesthetic sound would be so big a couple years ago? Probably not, but it is. Genres come and go and evolve. There's nothing wrong with looking fondly to the past, but this is a reality that one must accept. As always, feel free to agree / disagree and state why.",Actually Blinding Lights doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all. The 80s pop thing has been back with us for years now. That type of song will probably stay popular until the end of humanity.,190
mp1gc9,"There's something about music recorded before 1950 that has a genuine haunting quality to it. Maybe it's because all the people who recorded those songs are now dead? Maybe because it represents a bygone era? Whatever the reason, this music fascinates me and creeps me out in equal measure. The first time I became interested in old-timey music like this was playing Fallout 3 and hearing [The Ink Spots - I don't want to set the world on fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6vqPUM_FE) juxtaposed with the post-apocalyptic hellscape you had to explore and thinking how perfectly they went together. There was a melancholy exploring a wasteland frozen in time to the soundtrack of a bygone era. The Ink Spots and their contemporaries eventually led me the the recordings of John & Alan Lomax and their preservation efforts of American Folk music. The mystery of these recordings fascinated me. Take [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUVXGtjYcqM) for example, recorded at a women's prison in 1939. Listening to it, it makes me wonder how she ended up in prison? was she singing autobiographically? did she murder her husband? I project my own narratives onto these mysterious recordings since there's no other information to go on. I don't know, maybe it's just me...   Are there any songs that genuinely haunt you/creep you out?","A good chunk of the music I listen to was recorded before 1950 and I can't say I find much - if any - of it to be particularly haunting.  I can perhaps see how a prison recording might have a haunting quality to it, and the Ink Spots scene in Fallout certainly uses the music in an eerie way (although I don't think that mood is inherent in the original recording), but I don't that's a characteristic of pre-'50s music in general, just those particular instances of it.",153
mq5sgg,"**EDIT**: ‚ÄúPromises‚Äù reminded me of another album I heard a few years ago, but couldn‚Äôt for the life of me remember the name of while writing this post. Having just remembered it now I will post it here as a recommendation. Szun Waves - ‚ÄúNew Hymn to Freedom‚Äù, a hidden gem of the young London jazz scene. Significantly more lively than Promises, and trading out the symphonic element for live jazz drums, this album brings spiritual, spacey avant-garde jazz and ambient electronics together in a very pleasing way. I highly recommend it for people who enjoyed Promises, or wished it was more lively. ‚Äî‚Äî Promises has been met with high acclaim in the music community. Based on the reaction I‚Äôve seen so far, expect to see this album high on many AOTY lists at the end of this year. Composed primarily by Floating Points with recording by all three collaborators, this is a fascinating and modern take on ‚Äúthird stream‚Äù jazz (the intersection of jazz and classical music). The album is one long piece separated into nine movements, connected by a central theme that plays throughout the 46-minute runtime. The effect is hypnotic and cinematic, the connecting theme serving as a point to hold these loosely connected ideas together. The album features the variety ‚Äúpromised‚Äù by its three collaborators, with some movements focusing on jazz, others strings, and others ambient electronics. The mood is deeply meditative, channeling the vibe of Pharoah Sanders‚Äô most highly regarded work. I was not familiar with Floating Points prior to hearing this album, but I will be checking out his other work based on how much I enjoyed this recording. I believe this album has something for everyone interested in jazz, ambient electronic or classical music, or people interested in relaxed, vibey music in general. I recommend this album highly to anyone with these interests, though it‚Äôs also very accessible to people new to these styles but interested by this write-up. I am interested to hear the reactions of anyone on this album. Particularly, where you see it as an evolution of Pharoah Sanders‚Äô spiritual jazz work and as a modern take on the ‚Äúthird stream‚Äù.","Thank you for bringing this up. I'm loving the discussion it's spurring‚Äì especially from the detractors‚Äì because I'm head over heels in love with this. I'll be honest, I've been well acquainted with Floating Points throughout his career, but had never encountered (or even heard of) Pharoah Sanders. This was my gateway into him and I'm loving this journey for me.    A lot of commenters have found this boring, which I get. For me, though, the fact that they could take one piano riff and stretch it out over 46 minutes, keeping it luscious and fascinating every minute along the way blows my mind. For me, the payoff really comes in Movement 6. The orchestral swell continues to give me goosebumps. Extremely strong AOTY candidate for me.",30
mqdx4i,"I‚Äôm a fan of rock music.

I‚Äôm finding it difficult to find other music that I can enjoy and really get into, especially with newer bands. I try to branch out by listening to new rock bands, but rarely do any of their songs catch my attention - They all sound the same to me.

Perhaps I just have a strong attachment to the music I already like. How do you discover new music and bands?

If you don't listen to vinyl then trade digitally and have the same discussions, it's not quite as romantic but still works - if you like what your hearing then add it to your own collection - a friend of mine is currently on a Beatles journey having borrowed a few of my Beatles records and I am trying my best to understand the weird acid jazz stuff he lent me. Look into the bands and artists that inspired the ones you already listen to, I discovered John Martyn because I was big fan of Ben Howard.",110
mrj3bj,"Many young punks probably wouldn't recognize mid-late 70's acts such Blondie or Talking Heads as ""punk"" per se but they were in the context of the New York scene. in mid-70's New York, *punk* as we know it today existed only in fragments: [Richard Hell](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9f/c2/4e/9fc24e34c27599481f83fee334732f19.jpg) had the fashion--ripped t-shirts, short spikey hair & safety pins, [The Ramones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jotnGCDI_hc) had the sound--short fast songs with belted out vocals; bands like the [Dead Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3YbedLa5I0) & [Suicide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_dXp0eF8s0) had the nihilist/anarchistic attitude; [Jayne County](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgT-kiexnjY) and [The Cramps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM4yY4L6mFM) doubled down on the sleezed-up 50's inspired rock; and Television was [Television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C85wJtrtGQw), but I would say no one band encompassed everything that would come to be known/recognized as punk in the same way some of the British bands like the Sex Pistols did (except maybe the Dead Boys). It seems in NYC, punk was more of an interpretive, open-ended concept. The bands were more eclectic...very different from one another. The only thing that tied all those CBGB bands together was a sense of DIY. In London,  their interpretation of punk was more distinct. For better or for worse, they codified the genre and punk became associated with a certain look, attitude and sound. I remember Aussie band [The Saints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJwOKyTL23U) complaining about this when they arrived in London in '77. In their words, Punk essentially became a uniform.    Not to dump on the London punk scene because like I said hey codified the genre and it would've never taken off as a global movement without them, but at the same time I feel something was lost in the innocence & open-endedness of the CBGB scene.

A lot of them were pushing almost 30 at the time (or in their 30s like Debbie Harry and Patti Smith) .  The Ramones were punk but so was every other band who played Max's Kansas City and CBGBs.  Like Television is somewhere between hippie jams and new wave, but they fit in fine in New York at the time. London initially seems more young bands of teenagers or people in their early 20s who might have come up playing pub rock a year or two before (with the exception of The Stranglers who were older and weirder), but were fairly young and raw and were kind of looking at the template of the Ramones as something to build on.   It seems like post-punk in Britain just a year or two after punk broke started drawing in more kinds of college educated-types who took the music in all kind of different directions--then you start getting all kinds of electronic, funk and dub influences in England and you see all these other post-punk genres sort of emerge (like gothic, synth-pop, the funk of Gang of Four). I think New York basically was the genesis of punk and then England popularized it.  Similar to how techno and house started in Detroit and Chicago but blew up in England before the US embraced it.  The US went with marketing new wave instead of punk, but new wave became like alternative in the 90s where they threw all kinds of bands into the label such as one hit wonders like The Knack.",162
mrswi3,"In my opinion Kate Bush is the Best songwriter of all time. She has songs about the struggles of understanding each other within a relationship (Running up that Hill) to songs about Being a fetus scared of the effects of a nuclear war fallout while having a mother who smokes cigarettes(Breathing). And while the second song may sound like literally INSANE lol  if you have never heard of kate bush, its done beautifully. Also i think its cool how she produced her own albums. Specifically after the Dreaming (1982) , she had full creative control of her albums.  I truly just think she‚Äôs a really cool artist (one of my favorites of all time!!) so i would like to spread the Gospel of kate bush. And if you haven‚Äôt checked her out, you should. Edit: everyone should listen to ‚ÄúThe Ninth Wave‚Äù which is the second half of her hounds of love album and is like a mini concept album about a Near Death experience. It starts at ‚Äúand dream of sheep‚Äù and ends at ‚Äúthe morning fog‚Äù. Its amazing. My personal fave track from it is ‚Äúwaking the witch‚Äù","I could talk all day and night about Kate Bush so I'll try to keep it brief and talk about the music you mentioned OP. ""Breathing"" is a monumental slice of art pop prog. A lot of the music from *Never For Ever* is written from unusual viewpoints and this is perhaps the strangest one for a song that was released as a pop single: from the viewpoint of an unborn child that's probably going to die in a nuclear war. It actually got to #16 on the UK single charts. The chorus to it is phenomenal but it's the unexpected ending that really seals the song. Draw for the album version and not the single edit. Another song from *Never For Ever* that is extremely sad and also somehow got to UK #16 as a single is ""Army Dreamers"". In three minutes it covers the futility of war and how war robs soldiers of their future. You can almost feel the protagonist being erased as the song marches on. Both ""Army Dreamers"" and ""Breathing"" are very convincing anti-war songs without, to me, being overtly political. Both songs deal with loss at a personal level as opposed to a macro level. It's easy to see oneself in these songs, even as an unborn child. Lastly, I don't know if this is common knowledge or the stuff I've learned over time is esoteric factoids: the title track to *The Dreaming* is a reference to the pre-historical ""everywhen"" of Australian Aboriginal people: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dreaming If you are wondering why she is talking about kangaroos in the song, this is why.",94
msrgxd,"It's hard to believe: this July, it will have been 10 years since Amy Winehouse died in her home of alcohol poisoning. I think it's fair to say that I and many fellow Brits feel a sense of guilt over this: she was young and a drug addict, but rather than receiving sympathy she became the nation's running joke. The most talented British vocalist since the 1960s, and we let the tabloids chew her up and spit her out. Of course, Amy was also a victim of herself: she had a taste for awful men; she let herself fall into the drink. But the spotlight was unnecessarily cruel to someone so young. The discography she left behind is pitifully thin: two studio albums (w/extras) plus one posthumous. Obviously the latter can be discounted: have any of those scrapped together post-tragedy albums ever been good? *Frank* is trickier to dismiss, but it's still more ""interesting"" than accomplished. ""You Sent Me Flying"" and ""Fuck Me Pumps"" are two gems buried amongst the clutter, but on the whole *Frank* is directionless and occasionally quite nasty. And then there's *Back to Black*: a masterpiece that ranks amongst the greatest albums of the 2000s. The most obvious and vital change since *Frank* is the arrival of Mark Ronson as a producer. He described Winehouse as his ""musical soulmate"" after her death, and it's hard to dispute: *Back to Black* is by far the finest project either artist has worked on. Him having found her sound in a fresh and organic take on contemporary R&B (and Salaam Remi having followed suit), Amy was now able to come into herself as an artist. Her secret was the same as Kurt Cobain's and Dusty Springfield's: she felt emotion so deeply that they bled into the music. ""Rehab"" paints a portrait of a woman who feels heartbreak so intensely that she has to numb it with drink. ""You Know That I'm No Good"" is punctuated by the complex guilt and self-loathing of the cheater. All the love songs here feel *real*, as if Amy had been through a break-up on the same day that she was off to the studio. The apex comes with the one-two knock out of the title track and ""Love is a Losing Game"". The former sounds as much 1959 as it does 2006. The latter sounds eternal. Fifteen years later, and two songs could trick you into thinking that Amy was going to be alright in the end: the cathartic ""Tears Dry on Their Own"" (""I should just be my own best friend/Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men"") and the jubilant ""Addicted"" (better to get high than drink yourself to death). They make me wonder what she could have achieved if she'd been given the time to mature: she definitely sounds like a woman with at least a couple more great albums in her. But in light of tragic circumstance, switch instead to *BTB*'s worthy bonus disc, featuring her beautifully mellow take on ""Valerie"" and other nearly-as-superb covers. It ends with a demo of ""Love is a Losing Game"" that's almost too painful (the recording ends with Amy nonchalantly asking ""Is that alright?""). For all *Back to Black's* influence, no-one since has sounded like Amy. She was a rebel with a heart of gold, a genius who packed more soul into her recordings than any of her successors. We can only hope that the world will be kinder to next singer of her calibre.","Watching her documentary is a very painful experience, as you get a real-time look into every single person around her failing to protect her or do anything in her best interests. She was an addictive personality surrounded by opportunistic mooches and enablers, and her father was one of the worst of them. It‚Äôs so sad because as the documentary unfolds you repeatedly see opportunities for someone responsible to step in and help her, but instead the scumbags who surrounded her double down and make her life worse. The icing on the cake was when she went to St. Lucia to dry out and escape from the press and her father invites a camera crew to document it.",130
mtcbi4,"Don't get me wrong, I do not dislike him. But I don't get why an album like MBDTF is often mentioned as one of the best albums of all time. With the very high amount of samples and often rough transitions between song parts (imo) this work seems a bit plastic and unoriginal to me.  This is not supposed to be a hate on this album. I want you to tell me I'm wrong. I want to get the magic of his work. What are some points in his work where you say ""he nailed this like no one else did."" ?","Kanye early on was known for using unique samples in really smart ways, having good flows, and having an ego. But he wasn't at the superstar level he is now. A lot of the context from the time plays into MBDTF - the whole public backlash after interrupting Taylor Swift at the VMAs, his relationships falling apart, etc. Then he disappears for a bit, holes himself away in a studio, and comes back with this relatively abrasive and new sounding record (for hip hop at the time), that deals with the costs of fame, his own hubris, tackles the issues surrounding his rise to fame at the time. There's definitely a narrative at play around that album in particular. I don't think it's perfect by any means but I understand why it's so highly regarded. I also think Kanye often suffers from similar criticisms as other ""classic"" forms of media. Seinfeld doesn't seem as funny now bc every other sitcom started riffing off them. Prog music from the 70s doesn't sound as intense now that math rock is blowing the lid off of those sounds. And Kanye's production might not sound so innovative now that a lot of artists use similar techniques (and nah he wasn't the first either but he took his style mainstream).  I'm not even a huge Kanye fan tbh but I listen to some of his work, and the Dissect podcast season on MBDTF opened my eyes a lot to Kanye's production abilities as well as his lyricism and musicality. Worth checking out if you like podcasts and have some time, they go over a lot of the context and how it ties into the album themes/motifs.",372
musj70,"i recognize that playing live has become the central source of income for many career musicians over the course of the last decade. before COVID, I was playing live semi-regularly with a band, and I came to realize during that time that i don't enjoy live music that much. playing itself can be fun, but it's more that live music increasingly feels more like an impersonal social event than a cathartic experience, like when i watch live performances from the 90's/2000's. that kind of emotional release is why i love listening to and making records, but i don't feel that live music is given the same kind of respect and appreciation. if you go see a movie and start talking or pull out your phone, that's considered rude, but that logic doesn't seem to transfer to shows. COVID shutting everything down has only reinforced my feelings instead of making me miss it. that all being said, I'm re-evaluating my life as a musician right now and would like to create my own path that doesn't heavily involve playing live. I've seen a lot of artists adapt to COVID in different ways, like livestreaming, Twitch, podcasting, etc, but will they keep doing that once live shows become safe again? i personally would like to focus on music sales and merch, but I'm just posting to get some different ideas. would like to hear from other people with similar desires/outlooks on the state of the industry. thank you EDIT 1:18PM: really surprised by and appreciate all the comments I've gotten so far. will try to respond more later, thanks again ",You could always try to get your music placed in a show or ad or something.

musmae,"YouTube-Comments can be a cesspool. That is no secret. But a few months back most comments for automatically uploaded music have been disabled and it is terrible. Whenever new music get's released that I enjoy, I like going to the comments and see what everyone has to say. Usually the meme-potential can be phenomenal and when real discussion happens, it can be very insightful and entertaining. Now everything besides official Single-Uploads has been wiped away. And I haven't seen anyone mention it so far. Am I that out of the loop on that front or is no else bothered? &#x200B; Aside from the whole humor-angle that is lost, I feel, that less known artists who'll now upload their music via Distrokid etc. (Oh Snap! That's me!) will have a harder time to have people engage with their music, as comments drive the algorythms and can help push content to the front. Sure, you can always go to another place to look for conversation or start one yourself, but in most cases the people tend to talk where the actual music is. &#x200B; What do you guys think? Is it a blessing, that people won't spew their bile on all the stuff we love to listen to, or is it a tragedy, that it has become less likely, that we can discuss or joke about some of the gold out there?","What I'll miss the most is the comments about people's history with a song, always heartwarming",96

mxac7y,"I grew up in USSR/Russia, later immigrated to Canada. I mention this because while some classic rock acts like Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, and numerous others are well known and are generally regarded as highly as in the west (with few weird outliers like Deep Purple and Uriah Heep being as popular as Zeppelins and Beatles at some point), Neil Young is absolutely unknown. As a result, I haven't even heard the name until I was well into my 20s, my first familiarity with him was through the brilliant Deadman soundtrack (almost a decade after it came out), and my first time hearing him sing and overall being interested came only in the last year when I started learning guitar and seeing him pop up very often as a key name. Considering his longevity in music and monumental body of work, I'm a bit at a loss as to where to start though. Note that I'm not that interested in ""definitive album of the generation"" or ""an album that changed the way music is done"" or anything like that, I just want to listen to some great music. If anything he wrote in the 70s withstood the test of time and is still playing like a fantastic album - that's great. I've also heard him labeled as the grandfather of grunge - I'd be definitely interested in listening to something that earned him that!","These albums are must listens in my mind: After the Gold Rush  Harvest Rust Never Sleeps Harvest Moon Here are some others that I like very much that you might enjoy after listening to the aforementioned ones: On the Beach Zuma Tonight‚Äôs the Night Comes A Time Freedom Ragged Glory If that‚Äôs all too much for you, his compilation ‚ÄôDecade‚Äô is a great collection of some of his strongest work with Buffalo Springfield, Crosby Still Nash & Young, and solo material. For the most part, if you like Neil, you really can‚Äôt go wrong, he‚Äôs always strived for high standards and staying true to his vision. Of course some records are far worse than others but typically there‚Äôs a nugget or more on everything for the Young fan.

mxkfhf,"Kate McCannon, Devil Wears a Suit and Tie, Sleeping on The Blacktop. Great country songs that feel like aged classics.

mymch7,"This is something that I wanted to bring up mainly because mall goth fashion has made something of a comeback. The e-boy/e-girl scene on TikTok is blatantly inspired by it. Also some figures in the SoundCloud rap/trap metal scene have been wearing mall goth attire (Lil Uzi Vert and City Morgue, for instance). But I mostly wanted to talk about the music associated with it. I read an [AV Club article](https://film.avclub.com/the-soundtrack-for-the-crow-resurrected-grunge-kids-as-1798250903) that traced mall goth back to the soundtrack for The Crow. I can see where the author is coming from. The soundtrack is actually pretty musically diverse. The only goth act that's on the soundtrack is the Cure. Originally New Order were supposed to be on here, doing a cover of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" by their original incarceration, Joy Division. But New Order declined, so instead, NIN were bought in to cover ""Dead Souls"". Even though there's a lack of goth, it's sibling genre, industrial, is well represented. NIN (as previously mentioned) My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult and Machines of Loving Grace (an act that no one really remembers) are on here. Plenty of alt/rock metal acts are on here as well. Helmet, Jesus and Mary Chain, Rollins Band, Violent Femmes, Stone Temple Pilots, etc. Two surprising inclusions here are Pantera and Rage Against the Machine. The former did a Poison Idea cover and the latter did a rerecording of one of their older songs that's about Native American genocide. Seems a little odd to include a song about that topic on the soundtrack for The Crow. So it does make plenty of sense to draw a connection between mall goth and The Crow soundtrack. Mall goth is itself a mishmash of various subcultures, much like how The Crow soundtrack has multiple genres wrapped under a vaguely gothic aesthetic.  As for the music genres that are widely associated with mall goths, they're nu metal and industrial metal. There was also some overlap with emo during mall goth's latter days (MCR, most notably). However I should point out that I can't say that every nu metal and industrial metal act is mall goth. As for nu metal, Coal Chamber, Kittie, Slipknot and Korn are some of the biggest acts associated with mall goths. But what about the more jockish acts like Crazy Town and Saliva? Hard for me to imagine mall goths enjoying those. As for industrial metal, the biggest one is Marilyn Manson, but also NIN, Rob Zombie and Rammstein. However I don't think Godflesh ever would have had mall goth listeners. Wondering if anyone else had thoughts on this.","You are correct, of course. Very well stated.     I used to work in a dental office which saw a lot of teenaged patients. I saw more ""The Crow"" t-shirts than you would imagine on Goth kids, even up to just a couple of years ago.     That movie had legs. Of course, there's a certain level of morbid obsession, what with the beautiful young movie star, son of a legend, dying tragically on set. But it touched a lot of people in a way I don't really understand.",52
mz3rvj,"I definitely prefer the pre -1972 blues Fleetwood Mac music.  The pop-rock version of Fleetwood was still obviously good, and made substantially better by the great Stevie Nicks. But again, if I have to pick between the 2, I pick original Fleetwood. How much of the change in style was attributed to Peter Green's LSD trip in 1970? If Green never does LSD and leaves the band...would we have had a Stevie Nicks Fleetwood Mac? I'd venture to guess that most people don't know that Fleetwood Mac was a blues-rock band in the early years. Of course...even though I prefer original Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks is pretty f-ing awesome...and substantially improved the pop-rock version of Fleetwood.

mzgmzl,"Recent [celestial events](https://earthsky.org/tonight/april-full-moon-years-1st-supermoon?) had brought Nick Drake top of mind for me recently, and I thought it would be fun to make my first post here about him. I learned about his work over 20 years ago and was impressed by how  unique his sound and style were. His tragically short life produced some amazing art to me, both for his vocal abilities as well as arrangements and feel for sound and texture. From a simple finger-picked ballad to a full orchestra, all were handled more than adeptly in my mind. I find so many high points in what he has done, tonight I would say my favorite song is ""Fruit Tree"" but ask me another time and I'll likely have a different answer.  So in honor of the Pink Moon tonight, what do you think about Mr. Drake's catalogue? I would also be interested in thoughts about his progeny and comparable artists- it isn't a genre I have historically spent a lot of time in but certainly appreciate, and would love to hear what others know.

n0kri3,"Some time in the 60s Rock music developed as a distinct genre, different from the earlier Rock and Roll. ""Louie Louie"" from The Kingsmen (1963) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RZJ4ESU52U  was definitely Rock and Roll, while the earliest Rock song I could find was  ""You Really Got Me"" from The Kinks (1964) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTTsY-oz6Go Is it a safe bet that ""You Really Got Me"" was the first rock song ever, putting the birth year of rock music to the year 1964?

n2bfrt,"Hi, everyone!! 60s psych has turned into one of my favorite genres, and it‚Äôs something that I really admire. I‚Äôm a big fan of neo-psychedelia, and I really like music with trippy elements, so 60s psych would be right up my alley. I think that 60s psych was an amazing thing, and it did so much for music.  60s psych really focused on experimentation. Freaky compositions, drones, elements of Indian music, guitar solos, studio trickery, jazz, adventurous structures and more; all of that popped up. Sixties psychedelia really pushed the boundaries of what music could do; it definitely paved the way for progressive rock, and albums such as Sgt. Pepper, the Millennium‚Äôs Begin, the Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators &amp; the Silver Apples‚Äô first album had innovative songs that took cues from multiple places.  There was diversity, too. The Red Krayola had a thing for noise and free jazz, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream‚Äôs Disraeli Gears represented the heavier/fuzzier sides of 60s psych. The Beatles‚Äô Revolver and the Byrds‚Äô Fifth Dimension had pop songs that were peppered with psychedelia, and Forever Changes has gorgeous psych folk. 60s psych could be disturbing and complex, or it could be sweet and innocent (in a druggy way). Psychedelic rock, psychedelic pop and psychedelic folk are completely different styles, and the Doors had a darker, more ominous take on psychedelia.  I think that sixties psychedelia represented a time for change, too. Combining rock with electronics, foreshadowing metal, throwing in non-rock sounds/influences and going beyond typical structures; 60s psych was a movement that symbolized curiosity and growth. Electric Ladyland, the Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Strange Days, the United States of America‚Äôs first album, S.F. Sorrow, etc. did so much for music, and 60s psych was full of limitless experimentation and endless possibilities. I love how 60s psych focused on creating disorienting experiences, along with how it truly introduced different ways of interpreting music.  60s psych has a lot of gems, too! Kaleidoscope‚Äôs Tangerine Dream, the Notorious Byrd Brothers, Are You Experienced, Surrealistic Pillow, Safe as Milk, Easter Everywhere; all of them are classics.",It's my absolute favourite genre too. There are so many hidden gems that I keep finding too it's amazing. Have a listen to The Avalanches Wildflower album. It's made of 100s of samples of 60s psychedelic music and it's incredible.,94
n319wd,"It's time for my regular complaining-about-close-minded-music-fans post! I don't aim for much rather then to vent and discuss in this post. I've found that any popular old song I watch on YouTube seems doomed to have the same top comments, usually going something like ""They don't make music like this anymore"", ""Way better than the new music that's all about bitches, ho's and drugs!"", ""I miss when music had meaning and real instruments!"". This is obviously more prominent in songs from around the 80s past, but I've seen it in songs as recent as 4 years ago.  Regardless of your opinions on modern pop, don't people want to actually discuss the song or the video rather than *other* songs and videos? Of course YouTube isn't a place for in depth music discussion, but in newer videos people will talk about how much they love the song or the artist, or funny/interesting things they noticed in the video.

n3gr7f,"This is a pretty common critique I hear of electronic music and to some extent hip-hop; ""it's not made with real instruments"" as opposed to rock, traditional R&B, traditional country, jazz, blues, classical music, etc. The problem ends up being: what counts as a real instrument, and why are synths verboten while distortion pedals are fine? A lot of early electronic music (from the 1950s well into the 1980s) was made using keyboards (synths, keytars, and arguably claviolines, mellotrons, and arguably Hammond and combo organs), which are not that dissimilar from pianos from the musician's perspective aside from having an extra layer of electronically- or electromechanically-based settings. Let's go further - is any electrically-amplified or manipulated instrument not a ""real instrument""? Because the core of this objection seems to come from rockists who listen to a lot of electrically-amplified guitar music but who throw a conniption fit when they encounter Auto-Tune or pad synths. I do think a case *can* be made that purely digital music made in programs like FL Studio or Garageband lacks something that exists with physical instruments (including keyboard-based electronica), in that the skill of the instrumentalist being able to perform live is replaced with someone dragging and dropping boxes in a piece of software, but it seems like that nuance is almost never acknowledged and many of the same people who object to FL Studio-based electronic music also object to synths and Auto-Tune (which both manipulate a physical process) while having no problem at all with heavy distortion, multitracking, reverb, etc. which are basically the same freaking thing. I'll also concede that there is a valid objection to the use of drum machines and tape loops, as even though they are often mechanically based they are capable of looping endlessly without further human intervention and therefore require a narrower skillset than that of the constantly-aware drummer. (As an aside, an argument could be made that classical composers don't count as musicians either because they rely on others to play the music for them and the only categorical difference between Beethoven and Skrillex is that Beethoven has humans execute his vision while Skrillex relies on ones and zeroes to do it). So, why is distorted guitar considered to be a real instrument while a Moog or Casio synth isn't? Is it simply rockism in action?",This is a tired old conversation. I honestly thought people would have dropped this narrative by now. A synth is an instrument.,247
n5on1s,"I've had this curious experience with a song once. First time I heard it, the main instrumental hook got me immediately, but the rest didn't. I kept going back to it and 3 days later the chorus is amazing. 1 week later the verses are exceptional and I'm thinking: ""the hell is wrong with me and why didn't I realize that earlier?!"" Same kind of thing happened with an album over the course of almost a decade, as I didn't enjoy the whole of it so much the first few times, but kept going back to it regularly every year and last month it ""clicked"" and now I think of it as something close to a masterpierce. Similarly, I'm accompanying a friend's jorney into a new genre and his first time listening to a particular album was like ""meh, there's 2 good songs here"", but he was intrigued and on a second listen he enjoyed most of the album and days later it's one of his favorite things ever. Obviously repetition is part of the human experience with music and a thoroughly researched topic, but I assume intricate arrangements play a part on that ""rediscovery"" of a known song. I also have this baseless theory of how some melodies are ""wider"" or ""more open"" than others, which is a way to describe how sometimes it's hard to get the ""full picture"" of a song on the first time listening. In addition, you would need an understanding of the framework around it to fully appreciate the work on those melodies, thus I think that multiple listens won't help you find new appreciation in the case of oversimplified compositions. Other factor in that can be how dense the arrangement is. If the song has 23 instruments and 8 voices it will surely be hard to get everything that's happening on the first time.  I'm curious about other takes and experiences with that.","I, personally, have a tendency to find the new weird and offputting, but also exciting. So the best music is the stuff that intrigued me enough to ""give it a chance"" and I'll over time notice the nuances that I think I either missed or that subconsciously hooked me the first few times. That said, sometimes it's just a question of atmosphere and just where you are in life. Some music is great for dancing and parties, some is great for vibing, some is great for headbanging, some is great for fucking, etc. It's all about where *you* are when the music is there with you.",151

Even though the group had worldwide success and have written over 3000 songs for themselves and other artists, they rarely got the respect from their contemporaries and many critics, especially at Rolling Stone, treated them harshly and brushed off their music as being ‚Äòsyrupy,‚Äô ‚Äòbanal, trite, and without grace,‚Äô and ‚Äòmelodramatic.‚Äô One reviewer even said that they came off as ‚Äòunflaggingly moronic on television,‚Äô and were simply ‚Äòimitators.‚Äô  (The same publication later referred to them as ‚ÄòEarthly Angels,‚Äô so all‚Äôs well that ends well?) John Lennon even famously refused to turn around to greet Barry during an introduction in London in 1968. It probably took until their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1997 for their reputation in the US to begin to bounce back from being so unfairly maligned in the early 80s, but there are still many people who have negative feelings towards that era and their music of the late 70s. &nbsp;     A side note‚Äîin his later years, Barry has been [very humble](  https://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/ky17k7/im_singersongwriter_barry_gibb_and_my_new_album/gjdv13p?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about [his talent and ambition]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/ky17k7/im_singersongwriter_barry_gibb_and_my_new_album/gjdndu4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and even the HBO doc leaned into the narrative that Robin was the one who was much more driven for success. In earlier interviews, Barry talks about how as a child, he listened to the radio constantly, focused on what music was being played, what music was charting and what music sold records. He always informed his song writing and song writing of the group with his eye on achieving and maintaining commercial success. Even as a young man in his early 20s, he talked about wanting to discover and manage new talent out of Australia, wanting to produce for the Bee Gees and other artists, wanting to pursue other ventures such as acting and poured his heart and soul into the group projects.  &nbsp; One last comment before I get to the music, thanks to YouTube, you can find musical performances of Barry and his brothers from nearly every decade of their lives and can compare and contrast their performing styles, that were often shaped by the era and see how their performing styles and their voices aged and matured. You can essentially watch them age from teenagers to mature adults just through recorded performances. For example, you can find concert footage of Barry performing ‚ÄòTo Love Somebody‚Äô at age 21, age 28, age 34, age 44 and even age 70. The way he sang it in 1967 sometimes varied from how he performed it in 1974, and so on. Its would be interesting study of the evolution of music and performance to spend some time reviewing clips like this together. In chronological order of when they were released or when the album that they were on was released, here are is a list of Bee Gees songs that are not as widely known, but worth a second look. &nbsp; The Bee Gees arrived in London in 1967, got a record deal and a lead guitar player and drummer to complete their group and got right to work. In their early recording sessions during 1967, they wrote and recorded a batch of songs that would eventually be released as their LPs *Bee Gees First* and *Horizontal.* &nbsp; **World** [World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weOghXAltko) can be found on their second English album, Horizontal.  World begins with a loud piano and percussion, leading into quiet lead vocals by Barry, and leading into a strong lead guitar riff by Vince Melouney, their guitarist who was a part of the band for their first two English albums. The song goes back in to lead vocals, but this portion of the verse is at a louder and more deliberate volume and repeats this pattern. Piano, percussion and guitar, are all strong and towards the end, Robin gets one verse of a lead vocal of the chorus.  It was described by one critic as being a psychadelic ballad worthy of the Moody Blues' finest similar efforts. World was not issued as a single in the US, but was released in Europe and made the top 10 in many other countries.  &nbsp;  The group did record a promotional video for the song, which is worth watching and is quite modern for the times, even if aspects of it seem dated now. The imagery and direction of it are different from any of their other videos that the Bee Gees created in their career with psychedelic elements and shifting camera work. https://youtu.be/Wc2hq3vbO7w &nbsp;  In later live performances, the group often performed this song combined with a later song, [Run to Me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDNPk1VaZJQ) . In that iteration of World/Run to Me, they perform World as a ballad, with the focal point on the harmony during the chorus, as opposed to the harder rock sound that appears on the LP. &nbsp; **Run to Me** Skipping ahead since we just touched on it,  [Run to Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUEHmN0eXeQ) was a single from their 1972 album, *To Whom it May Concern*. This song did quite well on the charts, ending a dry spell in the UK where the group had not had a top 10 song in three years, and reached number 9 in the UK and 16 in the US. Despite that success, it usually is not considered one of the group's top hits and the album that Run to Me was on quickly fell off the charts and was quickly forgotten. The song has been covered by other artists a number of times with [Brandi Carlisle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMOtZNeXUyU) on this year's Barry Gibb solo release *Greenfields,* and has also been covered in the past by Dionne Warwick, Barry Manilow and Oscar DeLaHoya (lol).  Run to Me exemplifies what Barry Gibb and his brothers excelled at: writing simple, but emotionally moving lyrics in ballads and harmonizing. This song follows a similar pattern to a lot of Bee Gees songs of the era, with Barry and Robin both singing lead vocals and rotating the chorus and then it ending with a climatic chorus layering of all of their voices. I view this song as a follow up to their success with *How to Mend a Broken Heart*, as the song structures are very similar. Run to Me begins with Barry beginning the opening lyrics in a breathy, higher register and then moving back to the lower register. When its time for the chorus, Robin begins the lead chorus by himself and then is joined with all three brothers doing harmony vocals for the rest of the chorus.  &nbsp; Examples of the lyrics from the song include: Let it be what they said it would be Me loving you, girl, And you loving me &nbsp; Rhyming meters, simple and short phrases that are able to convey the emotions being expressed, which is very typical of their songwriting style. The song ends with the chorus in harmony and ends with a fade out.  The [live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCmzwsll8GY) from 1997 is lovely as well. You can hear the contrast and maturing of both Barry and Robin‚Äôs voices when you compare it to the studio recording and frankly, the Bee Gees are one group that almost always just as impressive or more impressive on their live performances than their studio ones.  &nbsp; On the topic of ballads, even as a man in his early 20s, [Barry Gibb talked about how the Bee Gees loved writing ballads](https://youtu.be/tgqZSjkNBb4?t=58). I have a lot more to say about how this relates to the context of the late 70s/early 80s Bee Gees backlash and what led to it, but it is outside the scope of this post and I may do another write up in the future on that topic. Suffice it to say, even during their off years when hits were few and far between, they always wrote great ballads and Run to Me was no exception.  &nbsp; **Songs from the Idea LP** &nbsp; Next up, in 1968, the Bee Gees began recording of their third album, *Idea*. The tracks featured on *Idea* seem to be the natural progression of the songs that were on the first two English albums. If you are new to the Bee Gees prior works, start listening with those three albums, *Bee Gees First*, *Horizontal* and *Idea*. The Bee Gees had the opportunity to film a TV program to promote Idea that consisted of music videos for each song on the album. Belgian artist Guy Peeleart was art director and created the colorful and modern set pieces in the videos. You may recognize Peeleart because he designed many famous album covers for artists like David Bowie and The Rolling Stones and designed film posters for movies such as Taxi Driver. The music videos are quite artistic and a work of visual art on their own.   &nbsp;  The videos that were created for Idea are very modern for the time period, although dated by today‚Äôs standards. On top of the vocals being a treat, the visual elements of the videos are eye catching and fun to watch. Peeleart did a fantastic job designing the sets.  Unfortunately, there seems to be very little information available online about the making of the videos or the group commenting on the filming process. &nbsp; *When the Swallows Fly* &nbsp; Although this is a great song, it was never released as a single anywhere but the Netherlands, where it just squeaked into the top 20. The song opens with the first line to the famous Wordsworth poem ""I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud,"" with Barry on lead vocals. After the first verse, it goes into the chorus, where the group harmonies come into play. At the time, Robin said that this was one of his favorite songs and he loved the way that Barry's vocals came out on it. It is considered a ballad, but it is a bit more hard driving then their usual ballads. It starts with a soft piano accompaniment with lead vocals from Barry and crescendos into the chorus by :40 into the song. The video has some great visuals in it and there is just something about the videos for their ballads where [Barry Gibb looks deep into the camera](https://youtu.be/MGzPlbwwnLY?t=16) that is just mesmerizing and in this video, having a much younger Barry Gibb performing in that way also has the same effect.  &nbsp;  audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyyDUxz26fU  music video: https://youtu.be/ZgboQ950oxs  &nbsp;  *Idea* &nbsp;  Idea is a catchy pop song, although it was never released as a single (maybe it should have been?). It starts off with piano and guitar riff and leads into lead vocals by Barry and leads into the chorus, with the verses being separated by Barry saying ""Ha!"" Barry explained that it was Jagger influenced, much like a lot of music being made during that time period. He also said that the heavier guitar riffs were influenced by Vince wanting to increase the energy of the song. Incidentally, this is probably where some of the differences between Vince's desire to do more hard rock and the brother's desire to do more ballads began to show clearly. (Vince subsequently left the group after Idea due to musical direction differences, although the Gibbs remained on good terms with him).  This video also does a great job of giving Vince Melouney and Colin Peterson face time as well. Robin later said that they loved one word titles, and then subsequently coming up with a song to match the title. He also listed Idea as one of his favorite songs out of their first three English releases.  &nbsp; Audio track: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBuFGJwBspE  Music video: https://youtu.be/oZ9RdE0R-Ts &nbsp; *Jumbo*‚Äîthis is a song that I included with the Idea songs, although it was recorded during the Idea sessions, it was not included on the original LP and was not added until Idea was remastered in 2006. The decision to release Jumbo as an A side came very late to where some copies of the 45 have the B side, The Singer Sang his Song, marked as the A side. This single fell into obscurity after failing to chart and not being put on Best of Bee Gees in 1969. This song broke the streak of five consecutive top 20 singles by the group in America. The song itself is short and not remarkable until the 1:42 mark where Barry enters into a staccato, fast paced line of lyrics, which elevates the song. I think with some rewriting, include that style of lyricism earlier in the song, alternating with the chorus and repeated again or at least lengthened, this song would have been more memorable and had an improved performance. That short line makes me think of REM‚Äôs It‚Äôs the End of the World as We Know It and I think the group really could have expanded on that portion of the song. &nbsp; [Jumbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_BliVy5kcM) &nbsp; **Songs from the Odessa LP** &nbsp; *Odessa* was meant to be the Bee Gee‚Äôs concept album, and concept albums were hot during this time period. During the recording of the album, Robin clashed with Barry and Robert Stigwood over which single would be the A side and which would be the B side. Robin wanted [Lamplight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyZkIlgZfmk) to be the A side, and Barry and Stigwood both wanted [First of May](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUhSp9ah7dw) to have that honor. This disagreement is what led to Robin leaving the group in 1969. After that, promotion for the album was dropped and *Odessa* was not well received, although in the following years has achieved a cult following and has been recognized for being their most ambitious record. First of May ended up being the A side and charted in the UK but given the state of the group by the time of its release, no other singles were released in the UK or US. (Marley Purt Drive was released as an A side in South Africa).  &nbsp; A source of tension within the group was that Stigwood was convinced that having tall and handsome Barry as the lead vocalist and front man of the group would help their image and consequently to sell more records. It‚Äôs unfair to Robin, who was an incredible singer and songwriter,  but in retrospect, looking at how much Barry‚Äôs sex appeal and image helped launch the group to worldwide success a decade later, I'm don't think that Stigwood was wrong.   &nbsp;  [Here‚Äôs what Barry said about the reasons](https://youtu.be/tgqZSjkNBb4?t=74) for the breakup in around 1970. Is he spelling out that Stigwood caused the break up? IDK. Odessa is a great album, a little strange in some parts, with instrumentals, chanting and other nontraditional elements to a pop album. In addition to listening to Lamplight as linked above, my other rec: &nbsp; *Marley Purt Drive*‚Äîwhen Barry talks about his 2021 release, Greenfields, and mentions that he has always been interested in country music and influenced by it, Marley Purt Drive and Odessa are proof. Even Colin Peterson, the group's drummer at the time of recording Odessa, said that Odessa definitely had country influences led by Barry. Vince plays lead guitar on MPT and sat in on the sessions as a favor to the group, since he had already left.  I have thought about how Barry's solo career in the 1980s would have looked if instead of the lukewarmly received Now, Voyager, he had capitalized on the success of Islands in the Stream, Eyes that See in the Dark and his love of country music and wrote a country album for himself instead. In MPD, Barry‚Äôs voice never sounded so bright and clear in it and it knocked my socks off the first time I listened to it. If you ask me, *this* should have been the A side from Odessa. Sadly, I cannot locate any recordings, audio or video, of the group performing this song live. I'm not sure that they ever did perform any of the Odessa tracks live?  &nbsp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqtzloiPxZE &nbsp; **Cucumber Castle** &nbsp; [Cucumber Castle]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/Cucumber_Castle.jpg)  is the 1970 Bee Gees album that does not have Robin on it and is the only Bee Gees album that did not have any musical contributions from Robin. Barry and Maurice also did a 45 minute television special of the same name that features many songs from the album. You can easily find it on YouTube, although its never been available for widespread circulation. Barry and Maurice both said that they ad libbed a lot of the movie and had a blast making it. Barry later said that his regret is that Robin was not a part of that project. Interestingly enough, CC was actually the last Bee Gees album to chart in the UK until Spirits Having Flown in 1979 (if you don‚Äôt include the SNF soundtrack and I'm baffled that neither Main Course or Children of the World charted in the UK, but that is for another thread). During the time of recording CC, Barry was trying to actively recruit a replacement for Robin, someone else to sing lead vocals and help writing and actually found someone who sat in on sessions, but he turned down an invite to formally join the group because he sensed that Stigwood wanted to reunite the three brothers. As to the Cucumber Castle LP, here are a few tracks that are worth listening to: &nbsp; [I.O.I.O.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TonXpGm7vLs). This is the only Bee Gees A side single to include a vocal solo from Maurice Gibb‚Äîthe I.O. chant. Robin and Maurice believe that this song grew out of Barry‚Äôs visit to Africa and his interest in world music. The song has been covered a few times by groups and is catchy and fun. Despite the turmoil going on between Robin, Barry and Maurice, its somewhat surprising how lighthearted the tone of Cucumber Castle and its movie are.  &nbsp; [The Lord]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDPorPflK34). This is another song where Barry‚Äôs interest in country and folk music is apparent. The Bee Gees as a group have never expressed any religious preference and the [portion of the CC movie]( https://youtu.be/gznBHlroM0I) where this appears is not a serious proclamation of faith, so this song seems to just be as imitating the country/gospel style of song for the sake of artistry. I also detect a slight country twang in the way they enunciate words in this song, so that is a first for the Gibbs. &nbsp;  **Tomorrow, Tomorrow** &nbsp;  [Tomorrow, Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvzeG-5cP3U) is a single that Barry and Maurice wrote and recorded during the time when Robin had left the group. It was released as a single on a 45, and does not appear on any Bee Gees album until the 1980s reissue of Best of Bee Gees‚ÄîSpicks and Specks had to be removed from the re-issue due to licensing issues and they put TT on it instead. TT was replaced later with S&S for future reissues after the Bee Gees obtained control of their catalog. You can still find TT on the Spotify version of Best of Bee Gees and the only other place you can find a physical copy of this single will be on a 45 or in the 1980s CD issue of Best of Bee Gees. It is not available on vinyl otherwise. &nbsp; Barry wrote this song with the intent that Joe Cocker would record it, which did not materialize, as his management never forwarded the song to him. Stigwood had the Bee Gees record the single and release it, but neither Barry or Maurice were happy with their recording because they did not feel that Barry had the right voice to sing this tune. Of this decision, Barry said ""This was a mistake that Robert very rarely made"" while Maurice remarked, ""I don't think it's us but I quite like it"". I think both of them are being too hard on themselves, as its a good recording.  I do wonder about what Joe Cocker would have done with it if he had been given an opportunity. The chorus would definitely have suited Cocker‚Äôs singing style. &nbsp;  **The Mr. Natural LP** &nbsp; -Cracks knuckles- &nbsp; Mr. Natural is the Bee Gee‚Äôs 1973 studio album that was released just prior to their breakout album, Main Course. At the time of its‚Äô release, Mr. Natural was largely ignored by the public and had poor sales--even worse than *Life in a Tin Can* (ouch!)-- but in subsequent years, it has become a fan favorite and  personally is one of my favorite Bee Gees records. &nbsp; Despite its lack of commercial success, *Mr. Natural* was a transformative album for the group. They moved away from songs with sweeping string arrangements and other elements that were difficult to replicate in a live venue and moved toward songs that could be played in front of a live audience. The album sounds different than any Bee Gees album that came before or after it and had a strong influence of hard rock, r&b, and jazz elements. Although the album is a studio album, it has live album energy and you can picture the band  jamming out to [Down the Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkTOaRWaJI) in front of a live audience.  I highly recommend you listen to [Throw a Penny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FavVdkVvQtc) before Down the Road because the two songs transition right into each other and were meant to be played back to back.  [Here](https://open.spotify.com/album/20yE90Byym8Hg9iFMegLZU?si=5QvbqfYCRDGF8Aef9qUGAg) is the spotify link to the entire album.  &nbsp; The other important aspect of this album this album changed the dynamic of the group and transformed Barry into the primary lead vocalist for rest of the decade. Robin was a gifted vocalist, and one of his songs, Massachusetts got the group their first #1 a number of years prior, not to mention the tension of the brothers that had fractured the group was still recent in their memory. Just to understand how significant the group dynamic shift was, if you went to a Bee Gees show in the early 70s, you would hear 10-12 tracks, with the majority of them being songs with Robin having lead vocals or a combination of Robin and Barry having lead vocals. Barry would usually sing one or two songs as lead vocalist, often Words and To Love Somebody. The image of the group was largely that of a group with neither of the brothers playing a more prominent role. Jump forward to Main Course and beyond, on Main Course, the only songs Robin had lead vocals on are songs where he shared lead vocals with Barry (7 songs). On Children of the World, Robin only had three songs with lead vocals and all three of them shared lead vocals with Barry. On Spirits Having Flown, Robin only shared lead vocals in two songs and Barry had sole lead vocals in 8(!) of the tracks. If you are 50 or younger and grew up thinking that Barry Gibb was the Bee Gees, this is why, and Mr. Natural was the start of that dynamic. Robin does not regain any substantial lead vocals until Living Eyes is released in 1981 (also, I'm not trying to express an opinion about whether Robin was resentful of this, by many accounts, he was pleased that Barry's falsetto was bringing so much success to the group and was still extremely active in songwriting and backing vocals and other creative aspects).   &nbsp; The title track, [Mr. Natural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFulEf2aylE), shows the group‚Äôs traditional songwriting style that involved Barry and Robin alternating lead vocals to come together for the chorus with all three of them. Mr. Natural was released as a single but barely hit the top 100. The group did regularly perform this song on tour in 1974 and made a few TV appearances where they performed it. A few of the performances are on youtube and the group seemed to slow down the tempo of the song when it was performed live. I think that the tempo on the recording is the idea pace for the song and the slower versions just.drag.a.lot. The group performed Down the Road regularly on tour during the mid 1970s, but other than that, no songs from Mr. Natural have been a regular part of their live repertoire. The last half of the album has Barry on lead vocals in almost every song and he was lead on 6/11 tracks, shared vocals with Robin on the other 5. In the wiki, it shows Robin sharing vocals on [Heavy Breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvqHeI7InyY), but Barry‚Äôs vocals are the dominant voice that you hear and but for that wiki note, I would not have known that Robin had any lead vocals on it. Like I mentioned, through the arrangement of the tracks, you can hear Barry becoming the dominant voice of the group as the album progresses. &nbsp; [Lost in your love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K9qUA83cHI) was written by Barry and is a great harder driving ballad and much more sexy than previous ballads that they wrote and released.  *Heavy Breathing*, *Throw a Penny*‚Äã and *Down the Road* are the four stand out tracks, but in my opinion, the entire album is great.  &nbsp; **Spirits Having Flown** I won‚Äôt spend time on this album because of its dominance in the Bee Gees discography, except to mention that in a recent podcast, Barry said that he wrote Tragedy, Too Much Heaven and Shadowdancing (an Andy Gibb release) in one afternoon after he was bored from filming Sgt Pepper. Thanks Mr. Stigwood for forcing the Bee Gees to make that movie and inspiring Barry to get high and write? It also makes me think about what Barry's creativity would have been for SHF had Stigwood let them out of Sgt Pepper like they had requested.  &nbsp; **Conclusion** &nbsp;‚Äã‚Äã This was my [Swan Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHsTu7yFUMw) for Barry Gibb and the Bee Gees and if you got this far, I thank you for reading and hope you found some new music that you enjoyed or at least considered it. I am a huge Bee Gees and Barry Gibb fan, so I had a lot of fun writing this out.   &nbsp; **Discussion questions**   &nbsp;  1. Do you agree or disagree with modern critics who think that Odessa was the Bee Gees most important album, or do you lean on the side of some who say that the quality of the non traditional material on it outweighs the songs that are worth a listen? (aka were the Bee Gees off the mark in attempting this project at all?) 2. Almost all artists who have lengthy careers adapt to changing trends in their respective industries. Madonna has re-invented herself numerous times, as have many other pop artists.  Where would you draw the line between adapting to new trends or imitating new trends and do you agree with the Rolling Stone critic who described the Bee Gees as 'imitators'?  3. Have you noticed any other albums or tracks where the group showed country and folk influences beyond Odessa and Cucumber Castle?     &nbsp; **Sourcing:** &nbsp; I have done a lot of reading interviews, watching and listening to interviews, reading articles about the group in the past and I have tried as best as possible to include citations from sources that I referenced. If I missed any, it was unintentional. I tried to use the bee gees official YouTube links as much as possible. For songs that are not available on their channel, I used Spotify or found them on other YouTube channels.

I have only scratched the surface with what I have read in it and there‚Äôs so much content. Thank you to the creator of this blog.","The Bee Gees deserve so much more love beyond just those 'in the know'. It saddens me a great deal that friends of mine, otherwise well versed in music of the period, know almost nothing beyond the obvious. I decided to dig into their discography a few years back after noting that some of their earlier songs were being covered by some giants (Nina Simone, especially). I reasoned that if she saw something in there, they were probably worth spending some time with. Since then, there are still a few holes (their CDs, especially the nice reissues, can be a little pricey, so it's taking some time) but they've become a band I've have a lot of time for. Mr. Natural is a favourite, as is Odessa. I recently picked up their last three, and 'This is Where I Come In' was much better than I anticipated. (Size and Still Waters were interesting but patchy, I thought).",30
n75ypm,"Van Morrison released his new album ""Latest Record Project"" and backlash immediately followed. The album included anti-lockdown and antisemitic lyrics. In the song ""Where Have All The Rebels Gone?"" he sings about how rockstars should appose the coronavirus lockdowns. In ""They Own The Media"" there are lyrics relating to conspiracy theories of Jews secretly running the media(Jews aren't specifically mentioned but it is pretty clear what he's implying). Morrison is often seen as one of the greatest singer-songwriters. How do we deal with these situations? How do these things later in their lives effect your view on their earlier work if they at all?","The whole of society is never gonna come to a consensus on anything. These are decisions you have to make on your own. Does a song make you uncomfortable? If so, no explanation is necessary. Don't listen to it. If it doesn't, you don't have to pretend that it does because other people say it should. Does an artist's personal failings make you think less of their work? Only you know the answer to that question. People can tell you what to think, but only you know how these things actually make you feel.",202
n7wm03,"With the 20th anniversary edition being released soon, I‚Äôve been listening to this album daily since the announcement. Let‚Äôs be real...i never stopped listening to this album since I discovered it a few years ago. I‚Äôm not a fan of their album Wildflower at all, but with the release of ‚ÄúWe Will Always Love you‚Äù last year I know they still have the magic. For me, there has never been an album that has mastered the art of sampling more than Since I Left You. Each song contains multitudes, with sounds exiting the song just as quickly as they entered. I would argue that ‚ÄúA different feeling‚Äù is the greatest song ever created, with the upbeat first half of the song crumbling into a heartbreaking violin sample that has evolving percussion. Curious to see what you guys think about the album, as well as your thoughts on the rerelease.","Since I Left You is a masterpiece that I don‚Äôt think can ever be replicated again. And it will stand the test of time, as it has already done. But what don‚Äôt you like about Wildflower? That‚Äôs my favorite by them and the one that got me hooked on them",62
n8u1zg,"I decided to create this post after watching [Metallica- Battery (Live in Seattle 1989)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yHJBDeshPA) and [Metallica- Creeping Death (Live in Moscow 1991)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjjCp_QU5Qk). Those were my first introductions to those songs and the versions that I fell in love with. This does not mean I don't like the studio versions of these songs because I absolutely love them. However, anytime I think of these songs, the live versions come to mind. I think this is due to the added factors that enhance it, such as the crowd, the energy, and the extra nuances that weren't included in the studio versions.

n9vwz2,"Couple of weeks ago I was listening to Kanye West's ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" album on Spotify and cover that's uploaded is the secondary one that was placed on the market 'cause the first one was censored (which is also dumb 'cause it's an artwork of a painted naked white woman having sex with a black guy so I don't get it why is it so provocative). Anyways, now I was checking an album ""Nightclubbing"" by Grace Jones (also on Spotify) and there's another cover, not the original one. This one is even more dumb 'cause on the original one is just a picture of her dressed like a man with a short hair and cigarette in her mouth. What's happening with the world? I know everything's awful these days but at least art should be free, right? If a musician decided a cover for his album to complete his work of art, then leave him be. It's his world, his music, his art. &#x200B; P.S. I wanted to post this question also on r/spotify but they banned it immediately. &#x200B; Edit: Thank you so much guys for all the replies and comments. Didn't think this will be such a hot topic but the fact we got this conversation up in flames just shows that it happens a lot and often and people are aware of it. Will check out all the examples you mentioned in the comments.","I can't believe I'm the first person to mention ""Smell the Glove"" by Spinal Tap.  This is 1982, mind you.

naul9g,"I remember being shocked discovering a song [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xat1GVnl8-k) had so many views; at the time it seemed exactly like the type of song I figured would be a forgotten one-hit wonder 20 years later. But considering how many views it has racked up over time...a lot of people still remember and cherish this song and video and it made me think about the types of artists that will be relevant for future generations. Are youtube views a good measuring stick for that? While the Bloodhound Gang's apparent popularity baffled me, Nirvana still having an insane amount of views on their videos (1.2 BILLION on smells like teen spirit) gave me hope the ""good stuff"" (subjective, I know) will also be remembered. Unfortunately a lot of legacy bands/artists seemed aggressively anti-youtube for a long time. Particularly the Bob Dylan and Prince estates, who would try and scrub any song of theirs that was ""illegally"" uploaded to the site. I mean it wasn't until Prince died that they started uploading his stuff to youtube...think about how many young people missed out on discovering him from 2005-2016 due to this mind-boggling and counterproductive *boomer* strategy of selling music. Even a younger guy who should know better like Jay-Z subscribed to this scorched earth policy when it comes to youtube, unintentionally fucking themselves over. I remember youtuber Rick Beato complaining about Led Zepplin's estate sending him DMCA takedown notices when he put out a video breaking down the brilliance and nuance of their songs. These aggressive estates always trying to get songs removed are only hurting themselves in the end because this is how the younger generation discovers music: through youtube and streaming sites like Spotify and Soundcloud.   Are youtube views really important and a good way to gauge which decades past artists will be remembered and relevant in the future or am I making a big whoop over nothing?","I don't think YouTube views are inherently any better a metric for lasting popularity than chart success used to be. There are plenty of songs that were huge in the charts that are largely forgotten these days, and I don't see any reason that pattern wouldn't repeat with YouTube successes.",166
nbj244,"This has been plaguing me (hah) lately. I used to be one of those jerks who was at shows constantly. Sometimes if a band I really liked came around I'd see them in the states closest to mine too. In short, I love live music.  But now, I feel... uneasy about shows. Some bands are announcing concerts in June and July and I feel like it's too soon to be shoved against people in a 600 capacity venue. I'm vaccinated but I don't want to be slammed in the mosh pit against people who aren't. If it was outdoor I might feel different but there are some sold out shows already for some hole-in-the-wall venues and I just... feel so unsafe about it. I can't even imagine trying to go to a 10,000 person size weekend festival this summer...  I'm holding out hope that some shows I have tickets for in October and November will feel safer but it's starting to get to me that an activity I loved, that kept me going, that I actively mourned when this all started, now feels unsafe and irresponsible and... scary. I feel crazy, to be honest, but I just can't shake this vibe. So when will you feel ready to go back to a concert? Does the size of the venue matter (local dive or stadium?) or whether it's indoor or outdoor? have you already gone to a show? If so, how was it?",Today. I'm vaccinated. If it's a requirement for attendees to be vaccinated then I'm completely cool with it.,162
nc8ze3,"Space ambient has been my thing for the past 12 months or so. Mainly the albums you'd expect. Apollo, Structures from Silence, Zeit... Brian Eno never particularly clicked with me up until I heard Apollo, but it really did change everything for me as far as his music goes. Just those sweeping tones, the steel guitar that works surprisingly well as an instrument for ambient music, and An Ending as a whole. What a beautiful, beautiful piece of work, up there with such pieces like RDJ's Rhubarb as far as just blissful electronic music goes. Anyway, for me it just scratches an itch. I've been fascinated by space since I was a kid, and I think the genre as a whole does a good job of translating that vast timeless emptiness to an audio format. Like I could get lost forever in these works, floating along and observing the birth of distant, distsnt stars and galaxies. It's a crossover I never knew I wanted but I'll never let it go now that I know the genre exists.

nekp89,"With Tina Turner as a solo artist *finally* being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, its time to examine her solo career. Nearly all of this write up will be focused on Tina as an artist, but it will be impossible to discuss her career and legacy without touching on her work with the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. What is remarkable about Tina‚Äôs career is how much of her solo career was based on covering songs previously recorded by other artists, and how she had the ability to make these songs her own.  &nbsp; Tina [Born Anna Mae Bullock] was born in 1939 in Nut Bush, Tennessee. Her parents had a volatile relationship, frequently leaving her and her older sister with grandparents and friends. She went between her paternal and maternal grandparents, cousins and family friends‚Äô homes during her childhood. She has talked about feeling unloved and unwanted by her parents and how those feelings impacted her throughout her life. Her cousin Margaret acted as her surrogate mother and sister and was a strong influence for young Tina, and her tragic death, along with Tina‚Äôs half-sister, in a car accident in 1954 was a defining moment in Tina‚Äôs life. &nbsp; Like many black artists of her generation, Tina first began singing at church and joined the church choir as soon as she realized she could sing. Tina always had a flair for entertaining and her mother spoke about her coming home from the cinema and acting out the scenes she had just watched and singing the theme songs. Tina described listening to music on the radio, but not really thinking much about the artist behind the music, or music production. To her, it was just a voice coming out of a box. &nbsp;  In 1956, Tina joined her mother in east St. Louis and began attending school there. It was in St. Louis when she tagged along with her sister Aline to Club Manhattan on the weekends to show up for the Kings of Rhythm sets, where she met Ike Turner. During a break in one of their sets where Ike lingered on stage playing ‚ÄúYou Know I love You,‚Äù by B.B King, Tina was handed a microphone and began singing and essentially the rest of history. Ike began having Tina sing for his band, bought her clothes so she looked the part, and began mentoring her, as he viewed Tina as his ticket out of St Louis and into the national stage. Tina‚Äôs voice was like nothing anyone had heard in those days. Gene Washington said ‚Äúa woman doing that kind of thing was a no no. She was like Bessie Smith and some of those other great singers; but they sang the‚Ä¶blues. What we were playing was more of a swinging type‚Ä¶so [Tina] was something completely different for us.‚Äù &nbsp; When Tina was 19, she gave birth to her first son, Craig. Her relationship with Ike, which had been strictly platonic, became romantic soon after Craig‚Äôs birth. Henry ‚ÄúJuggy‚Äù Murray, the owner and proprietor of Sue records in NYC heard the demo for [‚ÄúA Fool in Love‚Äù]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKpISNtgJMs) and told Ike to forget about recutting the song with male vocals‚Äîit was Tina who made the song. Juggy suggested that Ike should make Tina the star of his stage show and not just have her on stage singing background, and use her for a ‚Äòstar time‚Äô segment that wound up each set. In response, Ike officially told Tina that she would be called Tina Turner and that the single would be credited to ‚ÄòIke and Tina Turner.‚Äô Tina describes that it was also around that time that even though she loved Ike, that she did not want their relationship to go any further. He had told her that if the record was a hit, that they would leave St. Louis and go to California. Tina, who had lived a very sheltered life to this point, felt uncertain about placing her future on Ike, given his volatile behavior. &nbsp;  In her autobiography,* I, Tina,* she reports that after she told him that she did not want their relationship to go any further, that he beat her with a shoe stretcher, which gave her a black eye and then forced her to have sex with him. She reported that Ike ‚Äúkept control or me with fear.‚Äù She further opined that ‚ÄúSinging with Ike was how I made my living. And I was living better than I ever had in my life. What was I going to do‚Äîrun back to Barnes Hospital and try to get my job back as a nurses‚Äôs aide?...I was hurt and scared, but I couldn‚Äôt think about going back‚Ä¶I knew the story of how [Ike] had tried to get his career going for so long, and how every time he‚Äôd get a foothold, people would walk out on him. And I swore I would not do that to him‚Ä¶I‚Äôll stay right here and I‚Äôll just try to make things better‚Ä¶..I wasn‚Äôt as smart then as I am now.‚Äù  At that time, Tina was 20 years old, a single mother with little formal education or life experience, and no income source of her own, since Ike controlled all of the money that came out of their singing gigs and record sales.  &nbsp; Aside from the abuse Tina endured from Ike during the course of their relationship, fractures in their musical compatibility began to show. In 1965, Tina recorded [‚ÄúRiver Deep Mountain High,‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu9RsJnf_c8) produced by Phil Spector. By this time, Tina had begun to long to break out beyond the R&B/rockabilly/blues music that the Ike and Tina Revue was becoming known for. The first time Tina heard Phil play RDMH for her, she fell in love with it. She said that for the first time in her singing career, ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt just R&B‚Äîit had structure, it had a melody.‚Äù She said of Spector ‚Äúhe just wanted me to sing the song. It was my voice he liked, not my screaming.‚Äù &nbsp; RDMH was described by Kurt Loder as ‚Äúa Spector masterpiece,‚Äù‚Ä¶Tina gave the performance of her life. While Spector‚Äôs early work has dated over the years, ‚ÄòRiver Deep,‚Äô‚Ä¶can still take the top of your head off.‚Äù Unfortunately, it was a disaster. It had mediocre reviews and was credited for being Phil Spector‚Äôs demise in the record business. It only climbed to number 88 in the pop charts in the US. However, in Britain, where audiences had previously welcomed with open arms the R&B styles of The Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds and others, it skyrocketed to number 3 on the charts and remained in the top 50 for 13 weeks. George Harrison referred to it as ‚Äúthe perfect record from start to finish.‚Äù Loder explains that lacking a native equivalent of blues and R&B, many British groups and their audiences were fascinated by the American R&B scene and black artists. On the success of RDMH, Ike and Tina and the Ikettes toured with The Rolling Stones. On this tour is where Tina famously ‚Äòtaught‚Äô Mick Jagger how to dance.  &nbsp; By 1969, Tina was tiring of the R&B music, sets and style that had become Ike and Tina‚Äôs signature. She began paying attention to the pop charts, which was something she had never done in the past, and began getting more interested in the music that she was hearing. Between ‚ÄúHonky Tonk Woman,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCome Together,‚Äù Tina began to build on her interest in rock music. She said that she had never really had time to listen to music because she was always working. She described when they were in Seattle and Ike brought her into a record shop and that was where she first heard ‚ÄúCome Together,‚Äù and had to ask who it was because she had not heard the Beatles before (!). Some time after that, she began performing [Come Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Um_RIFR8jE) and Honky Tonk Woman on stage, along with Proud Mary. Tina described as although those were white rock bands, that they were actually interpreting R&B, so all of these different genres were interconnected.  &nbsp; In 1969, Ike and Tina toured again with The Rolling Stones in the United States, and Tina‚Äôs star began to shine even brighter. Ralph Gleason, the esteemed jazz and pop critic of the San Francisco Chronicle and co-founder of RS magazine, wrote ‚ÄúTina Turner must be the most sensational female performer on stage‚Ä¶.she comes in like a hurricane‚Ä¶the number that total wiped out the house was her version of ‚ÄòCome Together,‚Äô‚Ä¶Jagger out to get a medal for courage in following B.B. King and Tina Turner.‚Äù Tina also performed a highly sexualized rendition of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been loving you too long,‚Äù which was immortalized in the tour film *Gimme Shelter,* and Tina later described the performance as ‚Äúembarrassing. But the people loved it.‚Äù &nbsp; In addition to performing, [Tina has songwriting credits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_written_by_Tina_Turner) for a list of songs, including [*Nutbush City Limits,*](https://youtu.be/jg7qrYqJ9ns) which was a top 30 hit for Ike and Tina.  &nbsp; Later on, Tina had a part in the Who‚Äôs rock opera, *Tommy* She also was a guest star on Ann-Margret‚Äôs television special, both of which showed that Tina could command and audience and her talent was not limited to Ike Turner‚Äôs band. She released a solo album called *Acid Queen*, which featured a cover of Led Zepplin‚Äôs [Whole Lotta Love](https://youtu.be/0xAXkmo-HTI). This album hit no. 39 on the R&B chart and produced this single and *Baby, Get it On.* &nbsp; In the year‚Äôs following, Tina divorced Ike and left the group, heavily in debt from the broken contract engagements. In order to support herself and pay off the concert promoters, Tina began a musical cabaret show in 1977, complete with her signature long wigs and sequined outfits. By the time the 80s came around, Tina and the audiences had outgrown this type of disco inspired show and the music business had changed. She was then dropped from her record label in 1978 after her solo album failed to chart. Up to this point, Tina was considered a nostalgia act and performed mostly in hotel ballrooms and clubs. Tina was 40 years old and wondered if there was a place for her, who aspired to be the first black female rock star, in the 1980s music business  &nbsp;  In the 1980s, Turner launched ""one of the greatest comebacks in music history. With the help of Roger Davies, who convinced her to change her look, to ditch her band and get a new one and she began playing sold out shows at The Ritz in NYC. After watching one of her shows, [Rod Stewart invited Tina to come on stage with him for a duet](https://youtu.be/evqkP402ApI) during his Saturday Night Live appearance, which re-introduced Tina to a nationwide audience. Tina was then invited by Keith Richards to open a series of three Stones shows in New Jersey, and was invited on stage to duet ‚ÄúHonky Tonk Woman‚Äù with Jagger. Her trajectory seemed like it could not be stopped. &nbsp; Tina was signed to Capitol records. In 1983, with a change of management at Capitol records, Tina was subsequently slated to be one of the numerous artists who would lose their contract with the business restructuring. In a stroke of luck, after a listening party for David Bowie (who was signed to a Capitol subsidiary), David told the executives that he was going to watch Tina on stage that evening and described her as being his favorite female singer. The executives realized that Tina was signed on their label and immediately requested 63 tickets to her show (including tickets for Keith Richards, John McEnroe, Susan Sarandon and many other hot celebs) that evening so that they could see what the fuss was about. After this event, Capitol was suddenly VERY interested in maintaining Tina‚Äôs contract and wanted her to start recording ASAP. &nbsp; **Let‚Äôs Stay Together** &nbsp; [Let‚Äôs Stay Together official music video](https://youtu.be/4rFB4nj_GRc) &nbsp; In 1983, Tina recorded (in one take) a cover of the Al Green song ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Stay Together.‚Äù Although Capitol initially declined to release it in the U.S., was an instant smash in Europe and she began to plan a European tour. Soon after, imported copies of the song began flooding into NYC, and the record became a dance club sensation. Capitol finally decided to issue a rush release of the song, which peaked at number 19 in the top 40, but went to the Top 5 in the black charts. Now Capitol wanted to get Tina back into the recording studio. &nbsp; **What‚Äôs Love Got to do With It** &nbsp; [What‚Äôs Love Got to do With it‚Äîofficial music video](https://youtu.be/oGpFcHTxjZs) &nbsp; Perhaps Tina‚Äôs most famous solo song, *What‚Äôs Love Got to do with it* was a cover of a song by an Australian group called The Twilights. Davies and producer Rupert Hine wanted to choose a song that would highlight Tina‚Äôs singing voice. So much of her prior discography relied on screaming and wailing, and Tina had not been able to meaningfully demonstrate her skill as a vocalist in this way before. Initially when Tina heard WLGTDWI, she thought it seemed ‚Äòwimpy,‚Äô and like a generic pop song. Once Tina began working in the studio and exploring different musical sounds of the song, it became a song that she grew into. Not to mention, the music video was a revelation. At the time of its release, Tina was 45 years old and the video played off of her sex appeal‚Äîsomething that was unheard of for female musicians over 40 during that time period.  &nbsp; **Private Dancer** &nbsp; [Private Dancer](https://youtu.be/d4QnalIHlVc) &nbsp; Private Dancer is a song that was originally recorded by Dire Straits. Mark Knopfler realized that the lyrics did not make much sense in the context of the all-male group performing it, so they shelved the recording until Tina came along. This song peaked at #7 on the billboard charts in October 1985. &nbsp; **We Don‚Äôt Need Another Hero** &nbsp; [We don‚Äôt need another hero](https://youtu.be/NVPq-_t-ANw) &nbsp; Tina was soon offered a part in the next Mad Max movie and the chance to perform the lead song from the soundtrack. She won a Grammy in 1985 for Best Female Rock Performance for this song. &nbsp; Tina also participated in *We Are the World*, the LP *Private Dancer* reached number 3 in the charts (*Purple Rain* and *Born in the USA* were numbers 1 and 2) in 1984. At the 1984 Grammys, she won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Record of the Year. &nbsp; In 1986, she released her next solo album, *Break Every Rule,* which peaked at number 1 and sold over 5 million copies in its first year of release.  Her autobiography was also released this same year, to massive success. She also won a Grammy in 1988 for the *Tina Live* LP. In 1989, she released the *Foreign Affair* LP, which went to number 1 in eight countries, including the UK. *The Best*  &nbsp; **The Best** &nbsp; [The Best official live performance](https://youtu.be/nTBFy4rc6Lw) &nbsp; This song was initially recorded by Bonnie Tyler. Although it only peaked at number 15 in the US, it charted much higher overseas and has become one of Tina‚Äôs best-known solo works. Fueled by an online campaign for fans of the Rangers Football Club, this song returned to the singles chart in April 2010, in the UK, peaking at number 9‚Äîmaking her the first female recording artist in the UK to score top 40 hits in 6 consecutive decades. &nbsp; **I Don‚Äôt Wanna Fight** &nbsp; [I Don‚Äôt Wanna fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj3WhcGoSA4) &nbsp;  This song was recorded for the soundtrack to Tina‚Äôs biopic *What‚Äôs Love Got to do with it?* in 1993. This song reached the top 10 in the US Billboard hot 100 and  No. 7 in the UK. It was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Grammy Award for Best song written specifically for a motion picture. The performance has been described as one of Tina‚Äôs more restrained vocals and that it shows her versatility as a performer and ability to adapt to the times.  &nbsp;  Critical acclaim:  Tina has been nominated for and won many [awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Tina_Turner) over the course of her career. Having sold over 100 million records, Turner is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time. She has received 12 Grammy Awards, which include eight competitive awards, three Grammy Hall of Fame awards, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. She was the first black artist and first female to be on the cover of Rolling Stone. Rolling Stone ranked her among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the St. Louis Walk of Fame. She is a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Ike Turner in 1991 and as a solo artist in 2021. Turner is also a 2005 recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors. &nbsp; In 2009, she had a 50th anniversary tour, which was one of the best selling concerts ever.  To conclude, it is far overdue to Tina to be inducted into the Hall of Fame as a solo artist. She is one of the greatest comeback stories in modern pop music, her music has transcended generations and genres and she has the honor of being the first black female rock star. Her live performances were legendary.  Discussion questions: 1.	We have had numerous discussions about separating the art from the artist. In her autobiography, Tina goes into great detail about the torture and control she was subject to during her years in her marriage. She spoke about her desire to go in a different musical direction but being restrained by her circumstances. On the same note, she had some extremely iconic performances during those times‚ÄîProud Mary, etc. Looking at it through the lens of Tina‚Äôs experiences, do you have difficulty separating art from the artist and enjoy her performances during those years? 2.	What place in music history do we put an artist like Tina‚Äîwho thrived and had the most success covering others music, and whose live performances often overshadowed her recordings? 3.	Are there any other black female musicians that you would put in the category of being rock stars? 4.	It is unusual for a female artist to have so much commercial success after the age of 40. Do you think in 2021, it would be possible for a female musician to stage a comeback like Tina‚Äôs at her age?

nho6o3," ***Rant:*** I hate it. I hate the fact that now anytime I listen to a song, and it finishes with nothing left in the queue; it goes straight to recommending the same 5 songs of the nearest genre. Always the same artists. EVERY time. No matter how long or short a song is, it's always the same recommendations. No room for expanding or listening to something obscure and new because Spotify just suggests the same shit I've been listening to. It feels like this is the way the numbers of songs are getting boosted to me, and that's what leads me to the next points; Spotify is now a numbers game and they want to rack them up quick; songs don't have to be long anymore and they're counted just the same as any other song on the platform. The shorter a song is, the easier it generates revenue. The play count on it goes up, boosting popularity. The number of plays are now shoved in your face whenever you open an album/song, as if to say ""THIS IS POPULAR, LISTEN TO THIS"". I've even noticed this with independent artists, they don't feel like their song is decent until the song breaks the 1,000 plays barrier. Even then, the numbers don't equal the quality of the song. Same could be applied to high-level artists. The appeal to showcasing numbers over music, has also ruined the functionality of the service for me too; It would rather you see more about the play count and deep-dive amongst an album, just so they can show you all the individual numbers of plays. There was absolutely nothing wrong with being on an artists page and just being able to select a song from a quick browse from the page. Why the fuck has this fascination with streaming numbers become a thing? **More than half of the numbers on Spotify are inaccurate anyway since the statistics are being counted since 2015 and the service has been around years prior to that.** What is the fascination with counting streams and showing the world? It ruins charts and it just gives stans another fake reason to show their favorite artist has another dumb thing to flex. Ew. Edit: This has turned out to be a controversial topic. I am not upset about personal gain from this rant. I have used Spotify for years, and the UI changes over the years to include more features designed to sway you to the same artists again and again are what bother me. And the more minimalistic changes to cater more to showcasing statistics than what content is amongst any of the albums an artist has on their page. Please don't bring your Spotify elitism here, these are valid critiques.","The new UI updates are getting consecutively worse as well. I now have to scroll further down the front page to get to ""My"" music. Before that it's all suggestions on artists, adverts essentially for the usual big artists, which I shouldn't be getting since I'm paying for premium.",174
nirlty,"I've noticed over the last year or so there is an increasing amount of pop artists and rappers experimenting with a sound very reminiscent of early 2000's pop-punk (Machine Gun Kelly, jxdn, yungblud, and basically any artist working with Travis Barker). At first, I thought it was just a nostalgia gimmick, but after the release of Olivia Rodrigo's SOUR, I'm not so sure anymore. The songs ‚Äúgood 4 u‚Äù and ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù both have heavy pop-punk influences, and this album is already getting some heavy airplay.  There was a somewhat quiet wave of pop punk/emo in the 2010's that spawned a wide array of bands (Modern Baseball, The Wonder Years, The Story So Far, etc.), but none of these bands ever had the mainstream popularity that seems to be happening currently.  A lot of today‚Äôs younger artists grew up listening to bands like blink-182, fall out boy, green day, etc. So now I am eager to see if all of this is just a passing fad, or if we are about to see a complete revival of the genre. What do y'all think?","There's a theory that holds that ever since [the early 1950s](https://globalnews.ca/news/4082568/the-theory-of-the-13-year-rock-vs-pop-cycle-alan-cross/) there has been a pendulum cycle between rock (including metal) and pop (including EDM). If you divide history from 1951 to the present into roughly 12-13 year periods, you get low points for rock music at 1963 (teen idols), 1976 (disco), 1989 (new jack swing), 2002 (boy bands and girl groups, although this could be nudged to 1999), and 2015 (post-dubstep, the beginning of the whole ""rock is dead"" concept that lasted to about 2018-2019 when guitars, pop-punk inspired singing, and abrasive processing began to be used in hip-hop in particular). While I don't think the 13 year thing is an iron rule, there is I think a kernel of truth in that audiences get sick of one branch of ""rock and roll"" and turn in the other direction. So naturally it makes sense that rock influences (vocal melodies and screams that explicitly reference pop-punk and metal, heavy use of guitar, deliberately abrasive production) would be gaining popularity once again around 2019-2021, with a possible end of the current wave of ""rock"" influenced music (pop-punk, trap-metal like Mario Judah and 6ix9ine, some tracks by Lil Nas X) in 2028 or so.",109
nl08ys,"I know that award ceremonies are arbitrary and mean very little but seeing MGK lauded as the biggest rock star in the world is pretty disappointing. His rebrand as a pop-punk artist feels like a label execs brain child because he looks the part and could be popular with both rap and pop-punk fans.  It really saddens me that the state of rock music in the mainstream is that the top artists music is mass produced when popular rock music, even when acknowledged by labels and award ceremonies, has always felt more independent compared to other popular music genres. Bands forming because a group of friends enjoy jamming and gigging together and improving over time is to me how rock should be represented to the masses. Hey maybe I‚Äôm just a grumpy guy in his late 20‚Äôs who is alone in feeling this way but I wondered if anyone else agreed? Who do you think the top rock artist in the world is right now? Maybe you buy the story that MGK‚Äôs transformation was natural because he always preferred rock music to rap?",It helps if you think of mainstream music awards as an extension of advertising rather than quality.  MGK was up for the award because the label wants to promote him or his record.,334
nmbnop,"Probably asked here already, but what makes you like extreme metal genres? Or why do you think someone would like it? I've recently gotten into death metal, technical death metal to be exact. But I am not exactly sure why I like it. Something about the brutality I think that don't come from any other types of music. I listen to more softer stuff too but sometimes I just try to find the most brutal sound I can. It has started to become a question I ask about myself a lot, because years back, I could not even imagine listening to stuff I do these days. I want to hear your opinions about the subject. To me, it's very interesting subject. Its not like I want to harm humans in anyway, even tho the lyrics were about that.","there's a lot of variety in extreme metal, so its hard to come up with something that perfectly encapsulates what makes all of it enjoyable to people. i don't think enjoying extreme metal with misanthropic lyrics implies anyone wanting to harm anyone else anymore than enjoying horror movies would mean wanting Freddy Krueger to actually exist. its just an interesting aesthetic that makes your blood rush. of course, other genres can be exciting as well, but i think the energy from extreme metal grants a lot more catharsis to the listener. sometimes, for some reason or another, you have a lot of pent-up energy, and you just want to listen to something that sounds brash and reckless. outside of some sub-genres of hardcore, i don't think there's much music more gratifying than listening to something like Pig Destroyer in these cases.",148
nqlmzn,"I was thinking about this since I found out that Joe Talbot has firmly objected to Idles being referred to as a punk band despite the fact that they are widely considered to be one. This lead me to look back on how frequently very prominent artists on certain genres have rejected their place in it (Nirvana and grunge, Aphex Twin and IDM, Blur and Brit pop, Mot√∂rhead and Heavy Metal, etc.) I‚Äôm conflicted about this issue. On the one hand I think artists should have a right to label themselves as they wish, but on the other hand I feel as do it‚Äôs up to the public to decide how to perceive a certain sound. So I wanted to hear some different perspectives.","Just because you call a fish an airplane doesn't mean it can fly.     I would say that genre classifications are often pretty pointless to begin with, but ultimately their job is to help communicate what kind of music something is. If people find it most useful to call Idles' music punk, and most people hear it and call it punk, then I guess it's punk.",235
nro6pv,"Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention's [""Flower Punk""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoVpJDZPvms) perfectly encapsulates the cynicism of the era. Here's a guy in Zappa that saw through the flaccid, sit-in activism of the hippies and summed it up for what it *mostly* was about: getting high, getting some action, then going home to bed (as he said it best lol). The Velvet Underground were another infamous band that outright rejected the whole flower power movement and thought it was silly. I love these excerpts from the book *From the Velvets to the Voidoids: A Pre-Punk History for a Post-Punk World*:   *""Rather than indulging in the contemporary fascination with hallucinogenics, the Velvets were an amphetamine band ‚Äì in every sense ‚Äì loud, cynical, brutal and frenetic.  They were not interested in mellowing out an audience. (p. 22)""*   and:   *[Velvet guitarist] Sterling Morrison: When we finally made it to San Francisco we were attacked directly. They convinced themselves that we were there to destroy the innocence and purity of their music. Ralph Gleason said that we were the urban evil of New York, and we were there to corrupt the simple beauty of the California music. (p. 23).*   This stuff fascinates me because Zappa and the Velvets were actually around and lived the youth culture of the ""glorious"" 60's. They were part of the zeitgeist but managed not to get swept up in it; they saw clearly what the hippies were about without romanticism and where that movement was heading, which is part of what made them outcasts in their own time. Who were some other artists/bands of the time that were also cynical about flower power (and what do you think them)? Were they just grumpy contrarians that were there to spoil the good vibes or could they actually see through the falseness of the hippies & that their movement was doomed to fail?   On a side note, anyone else think the [Beatniks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVOXxDV5BdI) were ahead of their time? they seemed to have the same free-wheeling, hedonistic lifestyle the hippies had but without the naivety, and adopted a more nihilistic live-fast-die young mentality. To me, they were a cross between the hippies and the punk generation, which is amazing considering their time in the sun was decades earlier.","You don't own a movement. You baton pass the movement to the rest of the world and the masses carry it the way they want to You can make a lot of the same points about the punk movement. Who realized it all was just a capitalist reset button and ignores punk entirely and all it's angry but misguided rebellious energy? And then pat ourselves on the back The Hippy movement was taken, molded, and rechanneled in the same way. Most artists at the time were NOT hippies, not the way we conceptualize them. Artists tend to seek out other artists, not other hippies, not just other drug users or whatever else. There's no real incentive to hang around with hangers on who do nothing but drugs, sex, and whatever else it is for them (good company or constant validation aside). Anyone doing activism is probably not hanging around those who are not, or if they are it's to their detriment. But the element of the masses would always degrade the identity Zappa doesn't get the credit he probably wants from me for his hippie hate because he hates everything. Hating plastic hippies is just another thing. He thinks tobacco is good for you. He's a real strange guy. Good music. Smart. Has a chip on his shoulder about everything though so it's not clear what's real, what's a grievance The Velvet Underground sounds more like an aesthetic. If you like dark clothes and noisy guitars and droning sounds, you're gonna be against the hippy movement because of what it doesn't reflect about you rather than what it does reflect about anyone. The Doors are the same, they are no flower power band, they embrace dark themes, dark moods, sinister psychedelia. ""You walk across the floor with a flower in your hand trying to tell me no one understands"" even Jim Morrison appears to identify with the movement as much as he is dissatisfied with it.",128
ntpapk,"In a lot of ways I feel like the true depth and breath of Prince‚Äôs catalogue is still being discovered, and appreciated by a wider audience, there is more to his soloing and lead playing then that same Rock Hall of Fame video that gets posted ad nauseam. But if that‚Äôs underappreciated then I don‚Äôt even know what to call his skills as a rhythm guitarist. Songs like Controversy, 1999, I Wanna Be Your Lover, and his work as a session guitarist on the Minneapolis scene is freaking incredible.  Only master of rhythm could have written a hook as good as Kiss or Let‚Äôs Go Crazy. You definitely hear the Freddie Stone influence on him when you listen to his Rhythm parts. What do you guys think? What‚Äôs some of your favorite examples of Prince‚Äôs skills as a rhythm player? Who do you hear in his influences?","Prince put 16 bars rhythmic patterns in pop music. He's underrated because he excels in so many areas.   Forget the popular stuff. Listen to songs like [Everlasting now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o07Q25LXg4Q), [All the critics love you in new york](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqbW_MWzT7k) or some [improptu stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBRtZVp7A3Q).",73
