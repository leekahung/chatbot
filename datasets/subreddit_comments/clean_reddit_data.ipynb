I m wondering as your wealth grew, or you became rich , what changes occurred that you did not expect? EDIT: I m getting a lot of what about wealthy women? questions. I just want to say, I am asking males because I m a male myself so I feel their experiences to be more relatable, this is the r/askmen sub and you are very free to ask women the same question on the r/askwomen sub. No sexist intentions, just find males more relatable in this context.'"

Women don t throw themselves at me nor do I think they re after my money. I travel a lot. I almost never cook for myself. I default to ordering in or picking up fast food. I love fancy restaurants. I still struggle to spend money on some things. And yet on other things, I ll drop thousands of dollars without blinking. The biggest change for me has been motivation. I used to love working and now I m struggling to be excited about anything. The biggest challenge is teaching my kids how to be self sufficient. I had house cleaners and cancelled the service. We do our own house chores. I do my own yard work. I still want them to have pride in ownership and recognize that there isn t a magical money tree.'"

She took off her clothing and lay down on the ground. Here. she said, pointing to her privates. You must put it in here. Tarzan removed his loin cloth, showing Jane his considerable manhood, stepped closer to her and kicked her right in the crotch! Jane rolled around in agony for what seemed like an eternity.

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with. Here's the joke I told: What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath? Throw your washing laundry if you're American in. One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago. Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown? No, replied the guy. He choked on a sock.\",\n",

I would love to help you, dear, but I must warn you, I will not lie. With your honest face, Father, no one will question you, she replied. When they got to Customs, she let the priest go first. The official asked, Father, do you have anything to declare? From the top of my head down to my waist I have nothing to declare. The official thought this answer strange, so asked, And what do you have to declare from your waist to the floor? Father replied, I have a marvelous instrument designed to be used on a woman, which is, to date, unused. Roaring with laughter, the official said, Go ahead, Father. Next please!\",\n",
       " \"I am TERRIBLE at noticing hints. Even when I do, I have a hard time acting on them because I have definitely misread the situation in the past, so I'm a little gun shy lets say. Because I'm so worried about being a creep, I might flirt, but I never really make a move on a girl because flirting can just be friendly, especially at bars/clubs. I am extremely confident in the bedroom, but getting there can be difficult sometimes since I act so rarely. Recently had a girl that was forward with how attracted she was to me, made the rest of the night significantly less awkward for me knowing that she was interested and not just being nice. So just a shoutout to all the girls that don't mind making the first move for all of us awkward guys out there!\"]"
