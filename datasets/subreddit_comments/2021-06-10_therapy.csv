9pnvpg,"It's not fucking me!! The lack of motivation, the lack of desire, the desire to recoil, the desire to hide my being, the desire to never share, the drive to stay small and insignificant, the negative voices, the general disgust with myself, the lack of confidence, the thoughts of ending my life, none of it is me. It's the fucking voice my abusive parents planted in my head over 30 years ago. Finally, I get it. I can feel it. I want to bathe in it. It's not fucking me! Now the real me can get to work and make this a life. Just needed to share. Thanks y'all!!!!!!!!!",Whoa that sent chills down my spine! That’s a beautiful epiphany! Now ask yourself “who would I have been if I wasn’t their emotional dumping grounds”,19

ak05zi,"When I’m particularly feeling crappy, I’ll go somewhere private (usually the bathroom) & have a therapy session with an imaginary therapist. They’re usually weirdly effective for me & help me feel better just through venting without interruption. Sometimes do I’ll have the imaginary therapist ask me questions. Does anyone else do this or am I officially losing my mind? ",Whenever I have a particularly hard time one of favourite things to do I pretend I'm famous and being interviewed by a talk show host. I find it to be really cathartic and helpful to pretend it's an older me talking about how it was really hard at that time in my life but I got through it and I'm good now. ,21
blzpqs,"In case no one has told you this, it’s okay to cry.  It’s okay to feel the grief and air it out like an open wound for all to see. The waves of agony will feel so thick you might feel like you’re drowning, like you can’t quite come up for air. Feel it all. And then, let them pick up the pieces of your shattered being. It’ll feel like you’ve been hit by a truck; you’ll walk out the door and hardly be able to stand.

bo7q1c,"Title says it all. I'm so mad at myself. Can't answer an f-ing question, can't get in touch with myself or my feelings, and certainly can't verbalize the frustration of the process. Silence and lots of mumbling ""I don't know"". To the point that I answered the silence with a quiet ""I don't know"". Therapist tried really hard, he did. I just. Don't. Know. Poo on me.",My therapist used to ask me if I really didn’t know or if I don’t know meant this is too hard to talk about. That helped me mentally reframe it. She also helped me to instead of say I don’t know say what I’m feeling in my body like “I notice my fingers are tingling”,18

ce36v8,"Kill what you don’t like. I killed my old self, because she didn’t nurture or motivate me. She didn’t want me to move mountains, and she didn’t like change. You can kill yourself too, but only the ugly parts of you. Killing yourself does not mean you have to stop living.","This can be very tough advice for suicidal people to accept at times, it can sound minimizing or invalidating.

cwf7hj,"I had this delima that I think I solved on my own without running back to my therapist. LOL This senior colleague was being nominated for an award that requires endorsement from our group. All our names are on this two page letter. I hate this guy, he's been horrible to me for years. I think he's a terrible leader. So I'm thinking later on I'll email the award committee and withdraw support. That way no one would know I didn't support him. Might even hurt his chances of getting a bit! Yea! &#x200B; But that's the cowards way out, right? If I don't support it I should say so. Even if it hurts my career. I emailed the organizer to withdraw. Said that I felt that my career was never supported by him. His leadership wasn't good enough for that award. &#x200B; Now let's see if I can get some sleep.",I’m gonna go ahead and give you an upvote for that. Well done,13
d0c24l,"It was a hook up on Grindr in my hotel room for work. What started out as protected sex did not end that way... And that's not what I consented to. Then afterwards he tells me that he has HIV. Wound up at the hospital and went through victim assistance. They gave me a care bag that had, a stress ball, two candy bars, a blanket, and a whistle. How fucking humiliating? Spending a day in a room with no windows, constantly repeating the details to nurses, doctors, police... The last thing I needed the day after.  I have to take HIV meds now for a month to prevent infection. Every morning I vomit aggressively because of the nausea. It's an awful way to wake up, but I have no other choice. Also I have no insurance, so it was 4 grand out of pocket, which of course I had to put on credit cards. This is what rape survivors go through. I NEVER thought this would happen to me. Telling this (anonymously) is part of my healing process so thank you for listening and allowing me to be vulnerable.  Also when someone says they've been raped, believe them. You can't make this shit up.",❤️ sending love and healing to you. I’m so sorry.,15
d4nq3r,"I’m not a big believer in therapy but I just started to save my marriage. For some background I really messed up by doing chores for my mom on the night of my wife and I’d anniversary. My wife has moved out with our daughter and has started with legal separation proceedings, which I feel is a silver lining (as it’s not quite divorce) but also doesn’t bode well for us. I’m having a lot of trouble opening up. I’m also having difficulty knowing I need to keep returning. I stupidly thought therapy would be a one and done type thing. I know I’ve got issues I need to work through and I shared some on the first day of therapy but I don’t really know how to continue. Any ideas on how to stay open during therapy?","Look at the therapist as someone to bounce ideas off of. They are kind of like us here, on reddit. Why did you post here? To get other peoples perspectives to see if yours needs to be adjusted, to brainstorm ideas and to get some tips on how to start making changes, right? A therapist is all that, but with more tools and experience. Plus, they ll go deeper (which is likely why you dont ‘believe’ in therapy - it makes you uncomfortsble amd nervous to ferl that vulnerable) than we can here, getting to the root. They ll have more time to help you analyse and come up with an action plan, specifically tailored to your own needs. Shop areound for a therapist you feel comfortable with as this is important, but dont use this to avoid the discomfort of the process you need to go through. Iow: find someone you would feel comfortable with to go with you to a prostate exam, for example. And get ready for some serious work.",10
dcth4r,I was feeling hopeless and terrible about therapy. We had an argument about my future. I always saw myself married and having kids by this point in my life but I'm in my 30s and have completely failed at romantic relationships and have never had a boyfriend even. I feel like my future I always wanted for myself isn't possible and it's out of my control. She kept telling me I didn't need a partner if I wanted kids. That I could do it on my own.  That idea sounded absurd to me and I told her so. She said I was making a choice. I don't feel like it's a choice. I don't want kids if I have to do it myself because I don't have any support for being a single mom. Ideally I'd either work 1-2 days a week or not work until my youngest started school.  Dating as a single mom would be even more difficult for me. But she kept saying it was my choice. I feel like the fact that men don't like me is out of my control and therefore kids would be out of my control. She again said not having kids would be my choice. I was so frustrated and left in a huff.  The next session I told her I didn't want to come back. She told me she expected a 50/50 chance that I'd would have even shown up and said she kept expecting a call from me to cancel. She kinda called me out on my bullshit about how I easily cut people put of my life instead of working through problems so I decided to stay. I figured I'd go a few more times than quit. I've been seeing her for two years.  This week I actually had a really good session so I'm really glad I didn't stop going. I have to work next week so I missing out on the session and I'm even kinda disappointed about it. We talked about small steps to my recovery with major depression and touched on the fact that I do have trauma. I've just never heard her call it trauma before. I felt my feelings were validated. Lots of people post here with terrible things their therapists have said and many are big red flags that they should find a different one. But if your therapist makes you upset it may not be a good reason to quit.,"When I saw the title, I was not expecting this to end with so much growth! Nice work being willing to hear uncomfortable things and grow through it— therapy is not always fun. Sometimes working through discomfort in a therapeutic relationship is an opportunity to learn how to manage all kinds of relationships. Wishing you progress in accomplishing your goals!",44

dl71dk,"It gets better. Let me explain: Almost half a year ago, I was there myself. Self-harming frequently and daily, suicidal, depressed, insomniac, and failing classes for the first time in my life. I was put in a psych ward for 3 weeks following my suicide attempt in the spring. During those weeks, I briefly became psychotic, though only for a day or two. While there, I made a massive notepad of everything in my head. All my demons, all my thoughts, everything wrong with me. While in there, I thought it was over, and had hated every moment of my existence up until that point for the past 2 years. Acquaintances were dropping like flies from their own suicide, and a mere 2 years earlier my only and best friend Erik had committed suicide. Point is, I was about as low as one can go. When I got out, I copied the most important parts of that notebook into a text document that I still update and revise to this day, coolio.txt. I'm not sure what it was, I think it was a collection of things, that made my mental state turn around, but by the time I left that place I was no longer suicidal, though all the other issues persisted. I was in a stupor for my first week out, but eventually set my foot down, steeled what little of my will I had left, and stopped cutting. I didn't know it then, I was just trying to fix myself, but that would be the beginning of a massive shift in momentum that leads me to where I am today, writing this post. Through the course of that summer, I would successfully kick cutting, train myself to control my dreams to avoid the nightmares that were the cause of my insomnia, and grow leaps and bounds as a person. While I'm still introverted to an extreme, I have enough confidence to make myself presentable and to start opening my personality to people. Now to where I am now: Consistently getting 4 hours of sleep a night, sometimes 6 (huge progress from rolling a die from 0 to 4), No longer suicidal or self-harming, and finally made a friend, 3 years post-Erik. While I'm still very depressed, and have so much to figure out, including 4 dense pages of coolio.txt, I'm on the upward path. One could say I hit rock bottom so hard I bounced. If you yourself are at rock bottom, know these words: You matter. You are cared for. If you die, people will miss you. They'll feel sad. People you know, people you don't. You may feel invisible, but you're not. Everyone is flawed, in their own different ways. You aren't a terrible person for that. The world is going to push you down, it'll try and keep you there. It'll try to kill you through your own mind. Don't let it, stand up, no matter how damaged and flawed you may be, and say ""**No, do it yourself, coward**"". And most importantly: **You will survive**. **You will escape. You will emerge, victorious over your demons.**",Thank you OP! ❤️,6
dlqirz,"My partner's therapist posted pictures of multiple clients to their business Insta-story. Faces covered, but easily identifiable, with ""endorsement"" text of how therapy is helping. Partner says this photo was during a portion of session which involves wearing headphones and closing eyes, so he didn't even know he was being photographed mid-session, much less consent to this and his feelings about a session being published on social media.  This is clearly a boundary violation by the therapist.  Is this even legal? ",That definitely is illegal in my state.,54
e4s2gi,"It was long overdue, but I finally found the guts to schedule an appointment. Right when I set the appointment, I felt like I could finally breathe again. I really hope it goes well. Any advice for first timers?","Start with what you’re comfortable with. Everything doesn’t have to be unleashed in one appointment.  Remember to breathe and don’t feel embarrassed about your thoughts or feelings. They are yours to feel and work through and that’s exactly why therapist are there for you!

e91fml,"I'm a community based social worker in Ontario.  I work for individuals who have been in a motor vehicle accident.   Ive been working with a man who had been fairly vulnerable even before his collision (very little community supports,  no family or friends,  history of hard drug use and trauma).  Up to his accident,  he was working and had gotten clean,  but after,  everything fell apart.   This year,  his insurance company randomly cut off his support and income replacement,  leaving him injured and with no income.  He was found dead at home last Friday and wad only in his 40s. I spent several days a week for the past couple of  months trying to hook him up with support,  but it seemed like everywhere we went,  he was just viewed as this ""addict"".  Well on Friday,  he called me with paranoid thoughts about there being people in his house and described 'not feeling right'.  I urged him to call the police,  which he apparently did but they simply arrived,  checked his home and left.  I then arranged for a taxi to take him to the hospital as he requested,  and that's the last I heard of him.   We were to meet the next day to view apartments but when I called and called to see if he could attend with me,  I guess he was already gone.  I'm not accepting of his death. I don't think it's right or fair.   This was a guy who had cleaned himself up but branded as an addict and I feel society felt he was undeserving of help.   Well,  that same man leaves behind a son who won't get to know the clean version of his dad as I did.   I don't know what I'm looking for here,  just lost a bit of faith in my trade and the community I try to support and be a part of.","I’m sorry your going through this. I understand his side fairly well. I’m an ex junkie that has four years clean that still gets prejudice everywhere I go. It’s why I must keep that side of myself to myself until I know a person well. Even though I’m incredibly proud of my accomplishment! I’ve had a doctor not give pain meds after I woke up from anesthesia because of my past until I was rolling around, moaning in absolute pain. My mom came when she heard me and went off on him. I still have PTSD from that. When I get blood taken, even though my track marks healed up nicely and are just small scars, I get dirty looks and snide comments from the phlebotomists. I can never tell anyone at my job for fear of mistreatment (which has happened). If I get overly excited, friends will sometimes think I’ve relapsed. I can never get prescribed ANY narcotic medication even if they’re necessary. Don’t get me started if I get pulled over for a minor traffic infraction. The list goes on. The stigma sucks.",18
e9ivvm,"So I have been struggling a lot recently with my depression and PTSD. Today in our session, I was breaking down. At one point I said, ""maybe I'm not cut out to function as an adult. I should be in a group home for mentally ill people."" And I shit you not, the sassy black personality of my counselor came out and she laughed when I said that. Then stated,""you don't even meet a third of the criteria for that. You're struggling, you're not debilitated."" And honestly, her reaction made me feel so much better than if she stayed neutral face and denied it. Because my statement was so outrageous in her mind, that it was inconceivable and humorous. It made me feel a lot more hopeful and reassured.","I love when I get a laugh out of my therapist. It makes me feel more validated than a “textbook” answer, honestly. It makes me feel like more of a person",55
eas7dn,I was finally brave enough to make an appointment. She called me to have a chat (was suppose to be half an hour) to see if we would be a good fit for each other. I knew the possibility was going to be there that we didn't work well together but I didn't think I would feel like suicide would be the better option after talking to someone. I cry easily. I know it's a problem I'm very aware of it and struggle with dealing with it. The second she started asking a few serious questions I was crying. I know it's frustrating but she was absolutely annoyed about it. Explaining how I should stop and just speak to her normally because we don't have much time and she would like to end the call asap. It was awful. She interrupted me in every sentance so I didn't feel like I was being heard or listened to. And told me I would be better off in a hospital so I can get given medication. Im not a doctor but talking to someone openly who could understand my problems a bit would already help me a lot. I don't want to be put on any medication before that as I know my problems are large but fixable. Anyways she ended the call after 15 min saying we aren't a good fit. I agree but she just said many things that were just awful. And then with just a simple good bye she hung up. Now I just don't think I have it in me to call someone else. I know I should but it took me months to build up enough courage to call this person. So the thought of a second person saying I'm not worth the effort professionally is enough to make me seriously wonder if its even worth me existing enough to try.,"the therapist sounds like a crank and indeed not a good fit for you-- but not because of anything you did, because of her attitude!  you're fine, and you deserve to find someone who will listen to you.",48
em7rmt,"Hey, stranger on the internet that ill never meet. My life is over and i wanted to share my story. My name is Zachary and I’m 18. In my “short” life I’ve endured more than i could ever imagine.  Lets start from the beginning.  The year is 2001, I was born into a family who didn’t want me used me as a slave. My father was a drug addict and dealer and my mother left when i was 3. She was also consumed by drugs and would rather pursue that over her kid. From the time i was 4 until i turned 14 i was stuck going back and forth between my Dad and Grandmother. They would get protective orders against each-other and it resulted in us being moves from house to house. At 8 years old I was forced to work for my dad doing HVAC after school, sometimes not getting home until after midnight. That continued until I was 12, then i was forced to take over a paper route my step-mother no longer wanted. We lived in a 2 bedroom apartment and it consisted of Me, my sister, 3 younger brothers, step-mom, and my father. Every-night we crammed onto a couch just to sleep.  Most days we didn’t have food because my father and step mom had drug problems. I had income from my paper route but it was taken from my father every week. We got aid from the state such as food stamps and wic but my parents would sell it for cash to buy drugs and clothes and whatever else they wanted. The whole time we lived here I missed school. From 6th grade to 8th grade i went a total of 193 days. December of 2013 our apartment burned down and we lost everything. During this time I got placed with my grandparents because my father stuck his dick in my ear an took pictures of it. My grandmother received the photos and had my father arrested. (He got out 2 days later and was never charged)  Remember when i said i wasn’t going to school? Yeah that caught up to me and i was sent away March 4 of 2014. I was placed in states custody for 90 days until the state could find a place to put me. During this time I succeeded in school getting the best grades ive ever had. Sadly thats where my good luck ran out. I was placed with my mother in June and it didn’t last long. I was kicked out of my house for getting addicted to drugs. I was home for 3 weeks before I started selling and doing Xanax.  Fast forward to 2016. Im in high-school, but its my second almost third time being a freshman. I still wasn’t going to school. My mother rented an apartment but never stayed there. So i did. I would party and just generally destroy the apartment. Well eventually my mom quit paying the bills. So I got a “real” job at taco bell. In the 2 months that i worked there i got hooked on cocaine. I wasn’t going to school again and my manger knew, so she scheduled me more and more. Most days i worked night shift which was about 11 hours. Sometimes i would work open to close because we were short staffed. Coke fueled my ability to work.  March,3rd 2017, i was sent to a psychiatric ward for a week from having panic attacks caused by my drug use.  Fast forward again to October 31st, 2017. Im in court for truancy and guess what? I got sent away. By this time i was smoking crack, snorting anything i could get my hands on plus selling a-lot of stolen drugs from my dealer. Anyway Im on my way to placement for the second time.  You want to know what scarred me the most? I had to take multiple drug test. You know why that scarred me? My family would finally see that i was just like them. I was trash. My mother got the report and it stated everything i failed for. Want the list? Here you go. Herion Cocaine  Xanax  Weed MDMA GHB And my favorite: Ketamine  During my time is placement i did really well i school once again. However i kept getting in trouble. Fighting other kids at the facility, staff and even a few visitors. I got caught with a cellphone which is a big no no. I got the option to take my TASC test which is the GED Test in my state. I passed it in about 4 weeks and was allowed to go home. Problem was i had no home to go to. So i asked my dad if i could stay with him. Sounds dumb right? Yeah i know and it didn’t last long. We eventually got into a fist fight and long story short he beat my ass to a pulp. After this happened my best friend said “hey you can move in with me”  So, it march of 2018, I’m staying with my friend but i feel like a burden to his family. So i left. I moved in with my sister. And I’ve lived with her ever since. Im starting to feel like a burden to her as well. Once i moved in with her i got my shit together and started working full-time. Doing? You guessed it HVAC. The thing that started all my issues has finally come back.  Now cut to December of 2019. I got laid off due to “lack of work” and my car broke down.  Current date is 1/9/20 and my car is still broke down and i still haven’t found a job. Its currently 5:14 am and I’m about to enjoy my last cigarette ever.  I know people may never read this and that ok. Its more for me to come to peace with my self. If you took the to read this, thank you from the bottom of my heart because thats the first time anyone has ever cared enough about me to hear my story.  Thank you for caring, goodbye","Update: Id like to thank all you for the positivity, ive never had this much support. Im being admitted back into the hospital to get medical help if necessary. Im also starting therapy on Monday.  You guys and girls have blown my mind. Ive never had support from the people around yet all you people on the internet care. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  Ill update you when I get home ❤️",25
ep45ao,I was waiting for my bus as usual and I hear a scream. Above me is one of the highest bridges in my city and below it is a bus stop and a main road. Where I am. All of a sudden I hear a few screams and then a gunshot like sound. Except it wasn't a gunshot. It was a thud. He didn't even look human anymore. I spoke to a therapist employed by the police on scene and got everything out but I still feel sick inside. I had no idea until today that the bridge was nicknamed the suicide bridge. What was chilling is the fact that he landed 2 metres away from me. It might seem stupid to anyone of you but I do feel lucky to be alive right now. I don't know how to really get over this properly. Any help is appreciated.,This is pretty traumatic.  Processing trauma can help reduce it's impact.  You can process it with a friend or with a therapist or with a group.  Finding a therapist who deals with trauma can be really helpful at a time like this:  They can give you very specific tools so that you can minimize the impact of the intrusive thoughts you're having. Everything you're experiencing is normal given the horrible circumstances.  I'm so sorry you had to experience this.,13

eyoqza,"It was only a few small tears. But to me it meant a lot. I struggle to show weakness and emotion in front of people, and i'd rather vomit than cry when I'm with others. I never thought it would happen. And the moments leading up to it felt cool. I held it in. And then he asked if I suddenly got emotional. And I did, and then my eyes got wet and the tears crawled out of my eyes. I've been staring at that box of tissues every session since i first went into therapy last summer. This time the tissues were meant for ME. And I took one. And I felt like a different person, and I still do. But now i feel like a person who can cry, and i feel a lot closer to my therapist.

f13j5l,"I’ve been reading up a lot on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques and doing meditation and one thing that I’ve began to start doing is observing my thoughts. Figuring out why they can influence my emotions the way that they do. Combining that with reading into spirituality, I’ve begun to question who I actually am, and realizing that I’ve been defining myself by things I’ve experienced my whole life. But experiences aren’t who I am they’re just things I’ve been through. I’ve been able to pin point that when I look at the people who I’m jealous of and feel inferior too, it’s because I wish I had the experiences that they’ve had.  Love, relationships, money, financial stability. Being jealous of people who have experienced things that I haven’t is what leads me to feel so negatively about myself.  For example people who have a lot of money get to spend it on traveling, and get to see things that I never have ( and my negative thoughts try to tel me I never will.) I’ve been in the observing stage but I want to be able to move past that and find a way to make it so that these thoughts can’t affect me.","I feel this too. And I think one of the best ways to not put myself through these thoughts is to not view them social media. I know it's cliche but if you can stop looking at friends, strangers travelling or doing things that make you feel this way, it helps. I've been doing it for a while and I'm a bit more at peace with things I can't do due to time, money circumstances.",10
f92qu9,"In order for me to move on in therapy, I have to move past my co-dependence of my mom (I'm 19) and live away from both my parents. This is a terrifying thing for me, and I'd be going to school and working while doing this, so I couldn't afford health insurance, but my therapist told me he'd charge me the same amount without insurance if I decide to move out.

f9q2to,I get so vulnerable in therapy. I really show the worst/craziest/insane/weird/ sides of myself.  I cry & say things I’ve never told anyone. I ramble. I blabber. I don’t make sense and run off on tangents. Sometimes I leave therapy and feel so embarrassed that I exposed that part of myself. That my therapist knows who I really am and how weird I am. I get so much secondhand embarrassment and shame and guilt after I leave that it makes me feel sick & anxious. Has anyone else experienced this? How do I not feel disgusted with myself for being so vulnerable?,"Yes, it's quite common. As a therapist myself, I've noticed this in clients and address it (if they mention it or bring it up in any way, and want to talk about it, of course). This can hinder progress in therapy, so it is absolutely essential for you to know that in absolutely no way is your therapist judging you, for anything you say or however you express yourself. It really is a safe and sacred space, with no room for judgement. Have you talked to your therapist about this? Maybe they could help you work through this guilt/ self judgement?",17
fa2k1y,"Instead of giving me an appointment reminder because we’re doing a consistent schedule now, (so I can’t just not come to therapy) my therapist wrote this on the back of my appointment card: “Dear Brianna, I’m on your team-100% :)”.  She said it was a reminder for anytime I needed it during the week.  As someone who has received no support, this means so much to me!

Everything you say to a therapist is confidential unless there is a risk of seriously hurting yourself, someone else or suspected/proof of child abuse. When people talk about hurting themselves, that doesn’t necessarily mean they break confidentiality and zip you of to hospital. They want to assess your safety.  Hospitals should always be an absolute last resort.  This means asking you questions like - how common are your thoughts of suicide? Do you have a plan of hurting yourself - when/where/how?  What’s stopped you so far? What other support or coping skills do you have? It is really common to have suicidal thoughts but not have any active thoughts or plans.  Therapists just want to help the best way that they can. It’s ok to talk to your therapist. It can be really scary but you’re not alone. I hope this helped someone","Thank you so much for writing this comment, the timing for it is honestly so perfect. I was beginning to regret telling my therapist about my harmful thoughts, but you’ve totally given me perspective.",26
ffsx52,"Because I sure haven’t.   A lot of us have insurance so we don’t have to pay this much but still, the therapist is getting that much money and I’d really like to hear from therapists if they look back on their day and honestly think “Yeah I deserve that 200 dollars for that session” and also why do you think you deserve it and what do you aim to do each session in order to make your sessions worth that much?","I'm curious why you think your therapist isn't worth that. I'm a therapist in training. This is what a therapist invests in order to be of service to clients (in the United States, at least) - 2-3 years of graduate school means large student loans 3000 hour internship after grad school that is often unpaid or underpaid 36 hours of continuing education every 2 years which means money lost from time away from clients or spending weekends away from our personal lives and paying for conferences and workshops. Most of us are small business owners - paying 100% of our own taxes (that an employer pays if you are not self-employed), office rent, health care, vacation time, and sick time. If a therapist does accept insurance, it takes up to 6 months to be approved by insurance boards. That's 6 months of only being able to see clients who can afford to pay out-of-pocket. And then we have to deal with the insurance companies - which is no small feat. After we're done seeing clients for the day, we have to take notes on each session that are legal documents. We are constantly researching things to help our clients. If a client asks me about something I don't know about, it's my job to go learn about it so I can be of help to them. We're often doing this in our free time. If they have an emergency and I'm on my personal time, I'm supposed to get back to them ASAP. When we are in session, we have to be 100% present. We don't get a mental break during the day. We don't get to take Reddit breaks when we're bored. We don't get to wonder what we're making for dinner that night and do a quick Google search for one-pot meals. We don't get to step out of the office to take a personal call or get back to our kids or spouses right away when they need us. Because YOU are our top priority when we are with you. We give a lot of emotional and mental time to every single client and the burnout rate is high in this profession. We are professional secret-keepers and many of you have some very heavy secrets that we hold for you. That takes an emotional and mental toll. People bring all their turmoil to us and dump it in our laps. That's the gig and we know this and accept it. But we also know that if we don't make enough money to engage in a healthy amount of self-care, we cannot be of service to anyone. And remember that we pay for our own therapy, too. Training to be a therapist is probably the hardest thing I've ever done in terms of time, money, and emotional investment. Once I am fully licensed, I will be charging what I am worth - just like every lawyer, nurse, accountant, dietitian, and other professional out there who puts this kind of time, money, and sacrifice into their training and career. You are paying for our time and expertise, the same way you would any other professional. I hope that helps you to understand why $150 a session is warranted.",53

ficmpr,"I've been seeing my current therapist for 3+ years now. I've done EMDR with her and have found elements of it helpful. RED FLAG 1): HOWEVER...Is it a red flag that whenever I'm under EMDR she's ALWAYS on her phone? Not talking, mind you, but always texting/doing things unrelated. I know they're unrelated because she's smiling at her screen. Meanwhile, I'm reliving horrific memories, bawling my eyes out, etc. But she's on her phone. She puts it down when I come out of it, but then she's right back on it when I go back under. She seems to not want to have traditional talk therapy sessions anymore because it's just easier to put me under EMDR and not have to use critical thinking. Plus, I feel she loses track of time while I'm under which is never a good thing to do because memories can become too overwhelming. (For reference I use small handheld vibrators so she just flicks the switch.) 2) Something makes me think she likely cares more about the business side of things. I've expressed my money concerns with her pretty much every session. My sweet mom is supporting me on her meager teacher retirement earnings and we're barely making ends meet. Yet, when I bring this up to my therapist, she says, ""But, she's doing okay. And she'd want you to see me as often as you need."" I've been cancelling more appointments because they're $150 per session, so that I see her once a month or so, but she's always like ""wow, I assume you've been doing really well because I haven't seen you in forever."" Yeah, because it's horribly expensive and my insurance is terrible. 3) she forgets a lot of little details about me and I always have to repeat myself each session 4) she always makes sure I pay first (and spends a few minutes of therapy time processing the payment), 5) she has NEVER been on time (the appointments are supposed to start at 1 but I don't see her until 1:10) 6) she always looks at the clock when I'm talking 7) she likes to prepare a shake or snack and eats/drinks it in front of me. 8) she's not very objective and is often biased Am I overreacting? Edit: Fun fact: I hired her for narcissistic abuse/interpersonal trauma therapy. Oh, the irony!!",You are underreacting. Source: am therapist,106
flmib8,"If you’re a survivor, chances are you have been victim blamed/shamed. In the past when it came to sexual assault, it was often the woman that was blamed for “asking for it.” I recall reading a book called “Can’t Buy My Love” that talked about the influence of advertisements. There was a specific rape case where the judge ruled that the woman asked for it simply because the brand of her underwear was Victoria’s Secret. Now, we are finally holding men accountable for sexual assault, but why not for abuse? There is a stereotype that low income or minority females are too “uneducated” to not leave. This is false. Abuse can happen to ANYONE of any social class or ethnicity. Abuse is rarely shown right away. I’m sure if we saw it in the first week we would have run but that simply isn’t how it works, especially in narcissistic abuse. There is a “love bombing” or “golden period” that can last up to a year or more where the narc acts perfectly, the change in their behavior starts slowly and is a brainwash process that has us hold onto the love bomb period in the hopes of them being capable of being that way again. Once brainwash is complete, abuse is the new normal and the voice in your head telling you something wrong is still there but yet you feel trapped to leave. I’ve learned a lot about this type of abuse from this account \*\*@he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\* dedicated narcissistic abuse survivors. The handle alone makes me feel validated since I was never hit. Never let anyone judge you for not leaving right away. Leaving is a process and often involves extensive planning to be able to do it safely. No one understands your reality unless they’ve been through it themselves.  Edit: the “account” I refer to is on Instagram. Sorry for the confusion!","As therapist we should be able to ask, not as an accusation but as an attempt to get a better sense of our psyche.",6
fn27q8,"Has anyone else ever experienced this?

At best, it makes me feel silly - talking about problems I have that immediately dissapear. At worst, it's caused real issues and pain in relationships I've had over things that turn into nothing. It makes me worried to see a real therapist, too - I'd be a different person every week. Is there a word for this tendency? Anything I can do to figure it out?","Yes, this is so me",16

fptoss,"I had the misfortune of meeting an absolute awful ""Occupational Therparist who supposedly specialised in Mental Health.  She was unhelpful, unprofesssional and damn right stupid . I am genuinely shocked at how she ever even got a degree. I looked her up abe honestly her thesis titles sounds ridiculous and creepy AF. I believe that certain professions such as teachers, Therapists etc should be struck off once they exceed a certain amount of complaints. OT in itself imo is useless, they simply are not needed, the steal the roles of other people (therapists etc) and should leave their jobs to people who are actually good at theirs  I cannot imagine this individual rubbing off many people in the right way. In my country the complaints are quite soft I would imagine, like no firing would take place even if a patient got wrongfully discharged for example and killed themeselves soon afterwards.  So I just think that it is only fair  that strong investigations should happen for these crap therapists",Therapsit here. An occupational therapist is absolutely not a mental health therapist. She is breaking the law by practicing mental health therapy under the title of occupational therapist (in the United States).

ft31zo,"I am LIVID.  My husband attempted suicide last year.  After that he struggled through finding a therapist.  Finally found one he liked.  A few months later I get the bill from insurance and it turns out they are out of network and every appointment costs $180.  I am so angry because a therapist should fucking know better!! The first thing you fucking do is give them your insurance information.  One of the things my husband and I have been struggling with is medical debt and financial instability. Long story stort: he had a brain tumor, and luckily was treatable with surgery, but he has been unable to work fulltime for years and also has been denied disability twice.   How could a provider in good conscience continue therapy with someone knowing it would cost them that much?? She knew he was laid off and I've had my hours reduced to part time due to covid19! Literally making the situation worse for an already suicidal patient! How is this not malpractice?? tl;dr: husband started therapy when suicidal, now in worse position because therapist wasn't upfront about the cost","I’m really sorry that this has happened to you. I had a sort of similar experience after I attempted suicide myself. My therapist at the time left me without warning and nobody else in my area would take me on as a client bc they felt I was too high risk. I really was motivated to get better, but nobody could see past my attempt. They should have told you the cost up front or that you are out of network. That doesn’t seem ethical to me. Edit: I did finally find a therapist by asking my GP for a referral. Maybe start there?",12
fuj2ux,"I need to but I’m not sure how to open up with my therapist about a bad thing I’ve done I committed what’s called indecent assault a few years ago and I’ve already talked about it with my therapist. Moving past and, more importantly, dealing with the underlying problems that led to it are so important. I know what the problem is (I’m very very very impulsive, in a broad sense) but I haven’t done the work needed to deal with it.  Then this past summer I had another incident, with a girl. We were doing brunch and drinking and she was taking adderal (we’re both adhd but I’m not on stuff atm). Anyways she got bad fast. I’ve never seen that but it was confusing. Anyways she kissed me first and then later I was pushing for stuff and trying to make out and I realized afterwards it was bad. She was barely awake and then jumping and calling people and doing things everything 10 minutes or something. I didn’t realize then but I did later and I reached out and asked but she said I didn’t make her uncomfortable (I’m not sure how) and was like “when are we hanging out again”.  Regardless I am not ok with this. I’m not ok with being that kind of person. For a while I just thought maybe she actually wasn’t uncomfortable. But for the last few hours I’ve been thinking, maybe she doesn’t remember or maybe she was lying. I’ve heard people do that. Ever since to you two years ago I’ve been super anal about consent and about reaching out after if I’m afraid I did something wrong (never been told I did). The one time I could I talked about it in therapy and he didn’t think it was a problem. I need to make sure that I never do that again to anyone else ever, and I need to feel confident about this. I’m just afraid to tell my therapist out of fear he won’t see me or he’ll judge me or whatever. This is worse than the first thing, by 10 times. There’s some other issues with impulsivity that tie into this that also bother me that I’ve worked on but I’m afraid to go further with it. I have a hard time feeling like I deserve therapy.","If you can't think of therapy as help for you, then try thinking of it like help for everyone around you. The more you can deal with your own problems the less likely you are too hurt someone else. Think of it like your past traumas are a bomb, and you going to therapy is you learning to defuse that bomb. It will be difficult, and hard. But you'll be able defuse that bomb eventually.  (Sorry if that metaphor isn't the best. It's all I can think of right now)",60
fv45uv,"So today I felt okay. I didn’t feel weighed down, or angry, or sad.  However a few days ago, I was self harming and I also stopped taking SSRI’s about a week ago. These good days are good but they also throw me off. They kind of invalidate the fact that I’m going to therapy if that makes sense? Like today I was thinking “I have therapy on Tuesday...what if I have nothing to say? Do I even HAVE a mental illness if I feel fine right now?”  Like these random good days that I don’t have to work for just happen and they invalidate my whole thought process of the fact that I have anxiety and depression? Is this even making sense or am I insane?  I just feel like I don’t understand my mind sometimes.","Your light days do not invalidate the dark ones. I find light days are sometimes painful as the anticipation of depression looms over them. If I understand correctly, someone with Major Depressive Disorder would have to be without full criteria of symptoms for 2 months to be considered remission. Or less than two months with complete symptom remission.  Therapy is for everyone. Even people without mental illness. Even when we aren't struggling we still deserve support. There is always self work to do. Who knows what could come out of a good session on a good day. I imagine/hope your therapist would know what to do with that. Savor those good moments <3",32

fxbv1n,"Like it's so damn frustrating. I want to reflect on things she talked about but I quickly forget what she said as soon as our session is over. Throughout the week I might remember something else but I still can't recall the vast majority of what we discussed. Should I tell my therapist about this? I'm afraid if I tell she will think that I'm just not paying attention to her, which is not true at all. EDIT: Thank you for all the answers!","i'm a therapist. there is this idea that the patient needs to work. arguing by analogy is problematic, but i think this one's important to consider: does a patient undergoing surgery need to work? the answer is no, the patient just needs to tend to their wounds in between operations. it's fine that you don't remember. trying to remember could be problematic if you're exerting too much effort. the process is unconscious, you just have to show up each week and talk about what feels important to you. if a patient came to me with this concern, i might increase sessions to twice per week, as it sounds like you're ready to increase the depth of the work.",64
fy3a79,"I’ve always been very resistant to therapy. After two very negative experiences with therapist whose methods were unhelpful or who judged me and my issues, I denied myself the idea of going to therapy simply because I felt it wasn’t “for me”. I had also been indoctrinated for years under the idea that “therapy is for weak people who can’t figure out their shit on their own”.  So it took a lot for me to finally find a new therapist and go forward with therapy, but I did. And I couldn’t be happier about it. The therapist I found is absolutely amazing and I connect with her in a deep way. She makes me feel comfortable right from the start. It’s been nothing but positive experiences and the conversation flows easily. It’s been worth every penny, and I’ve left the sessions often feeling like I had just ran a marathon, but in a good way - exhausted but accomplished. Now I feel like my enthusiasm for therapy may be getting in the way of actual healing. I guess though that these past few weeks and this new interest of mine in really pursuing therapy and making it useful has pushed me down a road of “okay there’s all this stuff that I need to work through and I want to get through it fast”. Being more alone these past few weeks has also helped give me space to sit with all these feelings and thoughts I now feel the need to share. So yesterday our session wasn’t as great as the previous ones. I felt like I was just trying to go down this list of problems in my life that I wanted her to know about, rather than working my way through my thoughts intuitively and openly. So when she got to the end I was like: “oh, that’s it? But... I still need to talk about x and y and z...” The session ended with me feeling frustrated for not making a smart use of her time. I know that starting therapy comes with a lot of “mistakes” and a lot of “trial and error” when it comes to approaches. But I’d love to hear some of your tips on how I can make my sessions more productive and that can leave me feeling more at peace, rather than anxious to get through it all as fast as possible. Thank you! ❤️","So I've found that there's a difference between venting/seeking sympathy and seeking help.     I would divide these things into ""I need to make a change in myself or immediate surroundings to fix this"" vs just stuff that happened that you need to vent.  If a friend saying ""that sucks"" is all you need, look for that.  In addition to therapy.       And if you don't have an outlet for that, therapy is absolutely the place for it.  But you need to focus some of the therapy on building that natural support.",26
fzntlv,"So, recently I saw a very very disturbing trend in the r/PTSD sub. Many many people use their PTSD as an excuse to lash out at their beloved ones. Your mental illness is not an excuse for being hurtful to others. Of course, it is not that easy to determine. Sometimes, there is this thing called re-actional anger. So, it is possible that you get angry as a defensive mechanism and people are actually the one abusing you. It is never that simple! That being said, more often that not, I saw that this is not the case! I saw that the people lashing out did it without being provoked, but simply to make themselves feel better. Especially, if the person you are lashing out is a child. Yeah, I saw that, too. People lashing out at their younger siblings and using their mental illness as an excuse. Your mental illness is not a free pass for abuse. We are all suffering here, do not turn on your beloved ones!!! I have zero empathy for people like that. EDIT: Wow, thank you for the support. I felt so so shitty from all this. Also, for those who tell me stuff that I have cognitive dissonance or I am the same. So, me having the ability to differentiate friend from foe is a cognitive dissonance, but the lack of this ability is normal. hahaha aight As for me, being the same. Ha... you know, when I feel shitty and triggered, what I do, I go and volunteer, I extend a hand, I try to support others. Helping makes me feel better. I try to follow the path of the wounded healer, of bodhisatva. As long as there are suffering soul, I will try and be there. I will be where the pain is. Help others to heal, and you will help yourself. I have volunteered in a poor school, despite the fact children were huge trigger for me. Every time I looked into the face of  one particular young boy,  who liked me very much, I was back there, with the pedophile in kindergarten. So, the excuse that the child reminds you of your abuser, I know all too well. I did not hurt that child, I protected him, and I saw the glow in his eyes. I transformed my pain and supported him through his. All of them just spiraled me back than, really. So, I focused harder to make a safe spot for them, away from the physical abuse, they were getting, away from neglect, from childhood labor. I got a lot of abuse myself. The other teachers were horrifying, and at the end, I just cracked and left. I was really dissociated. I cried so much for those children. That's only one example. I don't care about my pain, though. I helped those children. I have saved lives from suicide, too. I remember that convo with that ex-cop, I had. Man, he was ready to shoot himself. I am ready to kill and to die for my allies, not to mistake them for my enemies. I know who those are. Oh, I do. My love is for my allies, my hate for my enemies. Is it cognitive dissonance having a moral compass and supporting your people? I don't think so. I am supportive, and I am nurturing. I know that. I have zero empathy for the abusers. No forgiveness or support to them. I am not like you! I am not like you people at all. For all of the rest of you, who are fighting the good fight, and you were there for me. This meant a lot! I do a lot of good, but actually I have a very fragile confidence and I am in desperate need for support. To the point that people totally take advantage of me and hurt me a lot. You empower me to go there and help more people. Thank you, I appreciate you all. All the best to you! EDIT2: I was censored in cPTSD for hate speech. I am living this place for good, but I learned from this enablers something. Hate speech they say. haha sure, I am very hateful towards child abusers. I am hateful and angry and I have pointed those feelings at the right direction. And for that I got silenced. It is crazy, but this is the world we are living in. This was a very toxic move, They sure showed me where they stand.  It is not only about the message ""Abuse is not an excuse for more abuse"". Oh, nooooo.... Not that. This could fly. I go against the status quo too much and the status quo is anger is forbidden, and hate is absolutely forbidden. Those emotions are bad bad bad, and you are bad bad bad for having them, and you will be punished like a bad bad person. This is what abusers do to their victims to subdue them. They shun anger and they shun hate, and they tell you are bad for expressing them, in order to have you under their control. This is the difference between a victim, and a survivor. The victim still believes that. What I have observed thus far, the unspoken rules are this: Every expression of anger and hate should be let go and not felt, unless of course you are losing yourself in dissociative fugue, you hurt others without control, or you hurt yourself without control. The only time, I saw people having support with anger and hate, was when they were totally lost and suffering from it, which of course they will be, when the answer is suppressing it. When you suppress an emotion long enough, it will consume you. I saw a lot of suppressed anger and hate in this sub. I am not afraid of those feelings, I am human, I have them, and I own them. Those feelings are the difference between victim and a survivor. Victims haven't owned them, and they still remember what it is like to live under the thumb of their abusers, of the times, where the abusers punished them for expressing anger, for expressing hate, for expressing basic survival instincts. They still haven't understood that those feelings are vital for survival. And this is exactly what the fight instinct is. It is often suppressed in victims. I understand it now. Society runs on victims, it runs on trauma. It doesn't run on survivals. I am a revolutionary just by saying to the abusers. "" I am enraged, I hate you"", but rationally and with control, not during episodes, without control.  I am calculated with my feelings, I try my best to control them, and not them me. But this can be done only with acceptance, not with suppression. So, it's hate speech hating on abusers, and you get censored, but it is totally okay, if you decide to harm yourself in your confusion or to hurt those weaker than you. And self-harm is exactly that, suppressed anger, and suppressed hate. I know. Been there, done that. I don't self-harm anymore. i am not angry at myself anymore, I don't hate myself anymore, I hate the people who hurt me. And damn that feels empowering! Those humans will never come close to me again! It is very healthy to love your allies, and hate your abusers. This is how you grow, this is how you thrive. Basic survival instincts. But it is not trendy to be healthy. You will ruin a whole society, that is fueled by abuse and by suppression. We don't want angry slaves, we want obedient slaves. And anger and hate sure make a slave rebel. Stupid slave! Why you rebel! Know your place. Stop being angry. That's hate speech! I remember this is what my lawyer told me, when I was planning my escape. Run and hide, because the system sides with the abusers, and no-one will help you. You don't have a chance. This is the reality. EDIT3: About righteous anger. I am very happy my friends do not enable my abusive behavior. I was abusive in my rampage. I lashed out at the moderators at AITA for thinking they censored me. They didn't. I was very wrong. They are very nice people and reacted quite kindly to my outburst. So, I am banned, righteously so! So, I made a mistake, and I own it. I will apologize once my ban is over. I am grateful for having friends, who are not afraid to call me out!  &#x200B;",I’ve also noticed this. Thank you. We should be nice and honest. Not nice and enabling,29

I haven't even heard stories of them being in love. I have no clue how they met. No proposal/wedding stories. Nothing.

I couldn't tell if my father had also answered the questions or if my mother had answered twice in different handwritings. (We're not the type of family to talk about feelings.) I have two older siblings (34&32). The oldest is developmentally disabled and lives at home (perpetually five, can be self-sufficient, but requires lots of supervision). When my parents no longer sleep in the same room, I wonder if responsibility for my sibling is keeping them together. My other sibling is married with kids. I wonder if their relationship is headed down the same path as my parents'. I was not planned. I've been told this, in a joking tone, but it's obviously true. I wonder how I fit in to the trajectory of my parents' relationship. I wonder if I've been left romantically stunted from lacking examples of healthy relationships. I don't want to dig into the topic with my family out of fear of severing the remaining threads and having to face the fallout. So here I am. I guess I'm just in a weird fucking boat, and I'm wondering if anyone's boat looks vaguely like mine. I don't even know how this boat is still floating. It's depressing, really.    EDIT to say THANK YOU: I really appreciate all of the support! I was not expecting this amount of compassion from a sub with ""about"" info recommending a ""thick skin"". It feels good to know I am not so alone like I thought. I think this has been a helpful step for me.  * Their choices do not dictate my choices.  * This is probably a ""leave well enough alone"" situation.  * I can still learn even though I grew up with a shitty example.  Thank you for reaffirming me. ",i read somewhere that children who live with married parents who don’t love each other grow up with more issues compared to children who grow up with divorced parents. they don’t learn what a healthy relationship looks like. you should definitely look into therapy if you feel like you have an issue you want to talk about.,53
g5vwqp,"Hey you! Yes, you! You're AMAZING! I appreciate you being your authentic self. I know things seem hard sometimes, but you can do it! Keep breathing and remember you deserve to be supported, honored, and loved. You are seen. You are recognized. Your experiences are valid. You deserve to feel safe and secure.

g8elou,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me(20,F). I started therapy 4 months ago and it was such a relief to finally have SOMEONE listen to me with no judgement. My therapist is amazing and funny and knows her stuff ... and most importantly I trust her.  However the past few weeks I don’t know what’s been going on with me. I can’t really cry anymore and it feels like I have no emotions. This leads me to feel that I’m faking my issues for attention. I’ve been feeling like I have nothing to say in therapy even though I’m numb and don’t even know what or even how to feel things? I’m not anxious anymore...I’m just blank...empty...hollow... I’m not even sad??  I’m doing therapy twice a week and in between I catch myself having imaginary conversations with my therapist, trying to explain certain things. I’m feeling like maybe I should quit therapy during quarantine bc it feels like a crutch or something I think too much about. But then again the thought of quitting therapy makes me very very sad because my therapist is literally the only person trying to help me in a non-judgmental way.  Fuck, what is wrong with me? I’m really tired of living day by day and everything feels pointless and I’m 20 but already getting old...and I feel like I’m faking mental illness subconsciously as an excuse to be lazy and get out of my work or problems.","You aren't faking. Those aren't excuses. You are processing. What you feel or do not feel is real. I think it is a good sign that your mind has a safe foundational relationship (your therapist) that is an outlet to process. Your logical left brain and emotional right brain are trying to communicate, to integrate and make all of this easier - the relationship with your therapist appears to be a conduit of that. That is healing. It is still your own mind doing the work. You say they are the only person helping you in a non-judgemental way? Does this include yourself? If your brain addresses the world in a conversation with someone who is non-judgemental (your therapist), I imagine that internal dialogue is safer from the internal judgements and patterns that other thought processes might follow. This feels like a safe step toward having clear non-judgemental processing on your own. Sounds like your ""crutch"" is a needed and valuable one that is allowing you to step in a direction toward less internal judgement?    Processing is really hard and draining work. You are NOT lazy.",24
gc7sy2,I literally feel like I’m faking everything and nothing really feels real....what does a typical day look like for a “normal” person who doesn’t struggle with mental illness? Are they like usually pretty motivated and balanced? lol I’m just trying to picture it to see if I’m faking everything :))),"Mental disorder / illness is merely a label we agreed to put on someone who meets the certain criteria. Majority of people will qualify for some diagnosis at some point of their lives - and that's completely normal, expected and shouldn't make you feel any lesser.   If you try to envision certain human traits on a spectrum, it's easy to see how no one's life is 100% stress and doubts free. Some days are harder than others.    Certain disorders (anxiety and mood) that heavily affect emotional functioning are very likely to leave you less motivated and out of touch.    Also, there still isn't an agreement on what constitutes ""normal"", so as long as you are happy and content with yourself and those around you, that's what matters.",31
gevlkd,"I started therapy.  My mom thinks that I have childhood trauma because my dad left/abandoned us. Although that is one of my traumas, She is the main reason I have this trauma.  At the age of 9 she tried to kill us all. When my dad was driving she pulled on the steering wheel trying to make us crash. I remember her saying we were all better off dead. This was because of my dad having infidelities. I knew about my dads infidelities at a very young age. Once my dad left. It all was worse. When he would call to talk to us my mom would yell at us for not asking him for money. If he said I love you, my mom said he was lying. I started “hating” my dad because I could avoid his phone calls and not have to deal with my mothers yelling.  I don’t feel that  mother-daughter love. I don’t like hugging her and don’t feel comfortable doing so. I also don’t feel comfortable telling her “I love you” because I don’t know if I do. I feel numb when it comes to her. We do text and talk but it’s more like I am talking to a friend or a distant sister.  This is something that I have never talked about. Ever. And this is something my therapist and I will be discussing.",Thanks for sharing that’s a lot to unpack. Roll with it and take it easy.,17
gg56py,I think I made a huge mistake last night. I told my therapist that I have feelings for her. I’ve had a crush on her for quite some time. I’m pretty sure she knew or at least suspected. But I confirmed it when I sent her an email telling her about a girl I like. I then told her a few hours later that the email was about her. I’m afraid that she won’t want to be my therapist anymore. She has really helped me a lot. My whole family has seen it. I don’t want to lose her as my therapist. I don’t know what to do.,"She may not automatically refer you to someone else - transference like this is actually quite common, and a good therapist should be trained in how to respond. If it gets in the way of your therapy together, the she (or you) may feel it’s best for your treatment to change therapists, but she should discuss this with you if that becomes the case.",94
ggfq8b,"I’m a guy, and we were discussing my anxieties which for me manifest in a running line of questioning about every thought I have.  Basically every action I think about is put through a hypothetical conversation in my head with what *I think* people in my life would say.  At best it’s a waste of time and at its worst it can lead me down a road of nonsense hypotheticals that create a “mountain out of a mole hill” and make the problem seem impossible.   I have made a lot of progress in isolating and identifying these thoughts for what they are, and can tune them out/turn the volume down when I’m aware of what’s happening. The problem is that it requires conscious attention to not let my mind wander down that self-questioning path. Like a well worn rut, if I’m not paying attention my thoughts will naturally drift back to the hypothetical questioning. This active control of my thoughts is what the therapist was talking about.  Even though rationally I know it’s not true I guess a part of me was holding on to the belief that therapy was a process where I would “fix” the problem.  Hearing the truth from my therapist was shocking. In a way, I can now definitely empathize with people who turn to medication.",My T says he often has to temper the expectations of his patients because they expect therapy to “cure” them. I’m assuming this is what your T was doing.  Medication is also not a cure. It is only a treatment.,95
gh5skj,"Healing when you have depression, trauma, or similar pains, is not a battle with a finish line, or an end goal. There are no checkpoints, and it is not linear. Think of it more, as a whale, submerged far below the surface. Trying to reach air again is a vital requirement. Alone, a whale will begin to lose its drive and focus, sinking without anyone helping them reach the surface. Therapy helps you focus on surfacing, and reminds you to keep your eyes looking upwards, even if you start sinking again. They help you look out for the tides that push you further down, and find ones that help you up. As you continue to get closer to the surface, you might jump in and out of the water a bit, and that’s okay. When you’ve been underwater for so long, it can take some surfacing and then resurfacing, and it becomes easier to float above the water as you breathe in more and more air.",Thank you. Starting Friday!,9

gj0wp2,"I just finished my first session ever with a therapist. I wanted to commend anyone who has reached out to one and encourage those who want to but haven’t yet.

gjf3lv,Today during my appointment I made him laugh so hard he snorted because I was trying to rationalize something that made no sense and we both knew it and neither one of us believed it.

glpi8f,I had access to a friend at every corner. I can think of tons of scenarios that could have led to dates. I was likable and personable. But I was miserable. I had a terrible breakup and it was all I could think about my last 2 years of college. I selfishly shut people out and my mental health was spiraling. So was my gpa. The work wasn’t so hard but I became complacent. I didn’t let myself get interested. Cut to 3 years after graduation. I’m in the real world with minimal friends and a city of stuck up people who have better things to do. I know it’s not productive but I’m super hung up. I’m still in my 20s which I know is a good place to be but I feel like it’s already game over. I wasted a great opportunity and I can’t get over it. I don’t want to be a bitter old man. But I worry that’s the way I’m headed which scares me. Edit: thanks so much for the kind words ❤️,You did what you needed to do in order to survive. Remember that. <3,13
gm2uek,"I was going through the internet, and I saw this phrase : "" Hope tortures you"". At first, I thought it was a really pessimist thought, but as I thought about it, over and over in my head, ai realised that sometimes, hope can indeed be torture for us.  I am not saying that hope doesn't matter, cause it does, it's one of the things that brings the world forward, but there are times I life, when we are so blinded by the hope of getting something, that we don't realise that it's not worth it anymore, if you ve given your best, and still nothing happened, perhaps it's time to think about moving on, I mean, what's the point of pursuing something, if even when you do get what you want, your strength will just be drained?  We need to learn how to move on from things, when they re not worth it anymore.  Stop hoping things will be better or change and start doing what you can, move on to other opportunities, new people, you will find freedom in the realization that you re not trapped by your hope anymore, and it will make you happier  Letting go of excessive hope isn't believing that things will be bad, or wishing that, or even not believing that there will good things, it's knowing that, everything can go exactly as you want, but everything can also go extremely wrong  Basically, don't get your hopes high too soon, take some time to evaluate situations, so you can always be ready to move on and face misfortunes.  I hope this helped","Hope is good, being honest with yourself is better.",11
gmstop,"So I had my first ever therapy session today. It was quite in the beginning, after I held a 10 minute  monologue about why I am actually there. I then stopped to take a breath. I was also really nervous and sweating, and my mouth was dry. She recognized that I was a bit overwhelmed by the whole situation. She said that it is quite a lot indeed. I then asked her if she has some water, and well, she replied by asking whether water has some kind of meaning to me, or what I relate to it. I was so confused. In my perplexed state I answered that I actually just have a dry mouth and am a bit thirsty.    She just looked at me with expectant, analytical eyes and nodded slightly without saying anything.  I was even more confused. So I just went like ""Uhmm. Ok. Alright so my childhood.."" and continued my monologue. Without water. For the rest of the session she actually seemed nice and normal and sane, and I also didn't mention the water thing anymore. But I just can't stop wondering about what was going on in her head when I asked that water question. Is there some psychological concept related to needing water? Is it abnormal to ask for water in a therapy session? Do therapists always interpret a deeper psychological meaning behind everything you say or do? It's my fist time being in a therapy session and I really don't know what to expect, what's normal and what isn't.  Thank you already for reading this. I'm still so confused and would like to know if maybe anyone here has some thoughts on my experience.",This is hilarious. I have to ask my therapist why he actually gives me a cup of water when I ask for one.,213
gnvfsd,"Idk if I'm going crazy but I swear I hear some people call me names under their breath for no reason. I don't cause trouble with anyone, I was raised to be a good, well mannered person. The people I feel like are shit talking about me is my step dad and some strangers. I've been diagnosed with mild cerebral palsy, hypothyroidism, depression and GAD. I don't know if my disabilities are making me hear things that aren't there or I have undiagnosed schizophrenia or something. I also get these weird rectangular shaped flashes very rarely when I'm in my bathroom when I get a headache. My mom said she gets them too and they're normal according to her, she's a registered nurse. That's kinda unrelated to my thought process but I wanted to put that out there. Idk if this pandemic has changed people and made them even more judgemental or it changed me and I feel like I'm being judged for who I'am or maybe my brain is just going haywire and making me hear things that aren't there. Any feedback from a therapist or someone educated in psychology would be much appreciated.","People do say shit about other people under their breath. People are assholes. Not all people, all the time though. People also say really nice things under their breath about people. You gotta choose who you want to listen to, and choose which person you want to be.

It is an absolute sign to take some pain pills because I am about to be on the ground in pain. I also have menieres disease so I have a thing called drop attacks where I get very dizzy and the world spins and I get vertigo and have to go down to the ground. It rarely happens but normally for about a half a day before hand I see weird shapes and stuff. I normally do not remember that this is a thing that happens before hand and am surprised every time.",30
got39t,"Due to graduation, I recently finished seeing a therapist that I made a lot of progress with. I was amazed at how much I could break down my vague and uncertain worries into tangible, actionable goals. I feel like every movie not about the apocalypse could be solved by a great therapist. Maybe I’m naive, but why doesn’t everyone do this? It’s amazing to the degree that you can build up confidence and structure in your life, to the point that it almost makes me uncomfortable how amazing it is.","For me it was/is fear.

My sister messaged my friend, who showed me screenshots saying my mother is dead due to breast cancer and other complications, however I found no obituary or announcements online. I feel this is another trap. But still. I had a panic attack after seeing the message. I cried for hours and now I'm just... numb. I have a first appointment with behavioral health on Tuesday (originally unrelated to this instance) so now this will be a fun story to tell. I just... i don't know what to do.

gq8eu6,"“Sure we can do a lunch chat just tell me where and when.” was the response I received when I asked a friend if they’d be available to talk the following day.  They parked in the space next to me (physical distancing and all). Each ate the lunch we brought, and said friend just sat/was present while I cried, all the while gently coaxing me to walk the path less traveled. The path is dark, sometimes a bit cold. The terrain is even but watch out for those rocks! They seem to appear out of nowhere and will trip me up if I’m not paying attention. But, you know what? I’m told that great things are waiting for me on the other side and these friends are always close by, ready to help when I stumble. I write that last sentence so easily; I just wish my brain believed it. Not a week goes by that they don’t say, “We’re here for/with you. You’re not going through this alone.”  As one friend sat with me, another was texting me, calling me out on my bullshit. Let’s face it; sometimes we need a dose of reality, or I do, at least. Laying it out on the line, the text usually begins with, “I know you don’t want to hear this but...” and ends with something like, “How’s that been working out for ya? You’re not alone in this journey; we’re with you every step of the way.” I know their concern for me is real because no matter what type of day I’m having, good or bad, their love for me never waivers, not even a little.

Our ethical code makes room for pro bono work, in the same way that a lawyer might do some pro bono work. At any given time, I generally have 2 clients I’m not getting paid to see. There’s limits to that, of course. A limited time period or number of sessions or something. Because I believe so strongly that ability to pay should not determine access to care, I’ve always done this, and I encourage the therapists I supervise to do the same.  Your therapist wants to do this for you. They have offered out of kindness and care. It’s good that it makes you uncomfortable - it shows that you understand the boundaries and restrictions of the relationship you have with your therapist.

gtesxv,"As a small boy I was sexually abused for years by my older sister (5 years older) . Don’t know when it started but i vividly remember the last time, she shamed me into thinking it was all my fault. So my entire childhood I thought I was ashamed and thought I was the abuser ( beyond fucked up I know) I think part of me died in my childhood and will never come back.  2 years ago I finally came out with the abuse and told my parents about it. They have a hard time dealing with it and I got the feeling they pick her side ( she is doing all the funerals/ family events / I have basically become an outcast in the family as I try to avoid everyone who I associate with her) although I am sure my parents believe what happened. I am often angry at my parents as a proxy for being angry at my sister. I know this is not fair to them but that is just what is happening. This come up often in the different therapies that I had. My sister has never acknowledged anything to.I have very unhealthy revenge feelings to her, they are not violent but more focused on telling the whole world what happened. Very often I contemplate writing a Facebook post about what happened. I don’t do it because I respect my parents to much. Last year the pain became to big,  I wrote a suicide note and was ready to kill myself but my roommate found out about the suicide note and after a call to the Docter I had to go to a mental hospital for like nearly 2 months. Where they finally gave me anti depressants and they managed my pain and depression. I finally admitted the shame to them because during therapy when we talked about shame I would dissociate and get flashbacks to those memories. After my stay in the hospital I thought I could move on and finally start my life again. But after a time I notice that something’s heal very slow ( avoiding my family, relationship with my parents, depression, suicidal thoughts). I have been trough a lot of therapy and therapists in my life but they all tell me that this is going to take a long time. And I feel like I have no patience in playing the long game to heal. Sometimes I feel that my current life is going to be as good as it is gonna get. The last few weeks I have kinda been seeing some girl ( she was a music therapist) and we have been really hitting it off. Like I finally felt like someone understands me and our talks where really good. Felt excited for a girl which were feelings I haven’t had in a long long time. Also scared me a lot.  However last Sunday she told me I was very affected by my trauma and that as a therapist she will have to find a good way to balance everything. I was very careful not to share to much about my trauma to her as I didn’t want her to become my therapist. But after reflecting back I realised that maybe I was more searching for someone who could heal me then I was looking for a relationship. So On Tuesday she told me not to date anymore. I am completely lost right now and I feel like every inch of happiness gets stolen from me because of this trauma.  I have been trough so much therapy and I feel like I won’t get any better then this. Which for me isn’t an acceptable level.  - I am completely alianated from my family.  - Depressions come and go. It is always waiting for the next wave.  - I never got an apology which is probably what frustrates me the most. The feeling of injustice is very high. However all therapist said it would be a bad idea to talk with her as it is far from sure she will ever apologise. As they can’t predict how I will react if I talk with her and she doesn’t apologise. However there is a lot of pressure from my parents to go and talk with her.  What do you guys I should do next, start searching for yet another therapist? I am also contemplating sending this to my sister so she can see how much damage she did to me. I know it won’t help me on the longer term but at least she knows how bad I feel.",One thing I've learned from my own past traumas.... we don't always get closure.  The bad guy sometimes wins. And they never apologize because to do so would mean acknowledging they were wrong.  I would not change therapists.  It seems to me you change every time they don't give you the answers you want.  Stay where you are and do the work.  Otherwise you'll never even begin to heal.,77
gvtqf5,"Hi all! I finally contacted my old therapist after about 3 years.

gw6k0p,"I have been crying for three hours and the voices won't stop, the pain won't stop.... I can't take it anymore it's too much, i can't do worse...... I gave up. I am going to kill myself..... I don't want to die but the pain is more than i can handle (i know this reddit page isn't about that kinda shit but idc) please help me please.... I can't talk to anyone, i can't call anyone, i... Am alone","If you are feeling suicidal now, please stop long enough to read this. It will only take about five minutes. I do not want to talk you out of your bad feelings. I am not a therapist or other mental health professional -only someone who knows what it is like to be in pain. I don’t know who you are, or why you are reading this page. I only know that for the moment, you’re reading it, and that is good. I can assume that you are here because you are troubled and considering ending your life. If it were possible, I would prefer to be there with you at this moment, to sit with you and talk, face to face and heart to heart. But since that is not possible, we will have to make do with this. I have known a lot of people who have wanted to kill themselves, so I have some small idea of what you might be feeling. I know that you might not be up to reading a long book, so I am going to keep this short. While we are together here for the next five minutes, I have five simple, practical things I would like to share with you. I won’t argue with you about whether you should kill yourself. But I assume that if you are thinking about it, you feel pretty bad. Well, you’re still reading, and that’s very good. I’d like to ask you to stay with me for the rest of this page. I hope it means that you’re at least a tiny bit unsure, somewhere deep inside, about whether or not you really will end your life. Often people feel that, even in the deepest darkness of despair. Being unsure about dying is okay and normal. The fact that you are still alive at this minute means you are still a little bit unsure. It means that even while you want to die, at the same time some part of you still wants to live. So let’s hang on to that, and keep going for a few more minutes. Start by considering this statement: “Suicide is not chosen; it happens when pain exceeds resources for coping with pain.” That’s all it’s about. You are not a bad person, or crazy, or weak, or flawed, because you feel suicidal. It doesn’t even mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. If I start piling weights on your shoulders, you will eventually collapse if I add enough weights... no matter how much you want to remain standing. Willpower has nothing to do with it. Of course you would cheer yourself up, if you could. Don’t accept it if someone tells you, “that’s not enough to be suicidal about.” There are many kinds of pain that may lead to suicide. Whether or not the pain is bearable may differ from person to person. What might be bearable to someone else, may not be bearable to you. The point at which the pain becomes unbearable depends on what kinds of coping resources you have. Individuals vary greatly in their capacity to withstand pain. When pain exceeds pain-coping resources, suicidal feelings are the result. Suicide is neither wrong nor right; it is not a defect of character; it is morally neutral. It is simply an imbalance of pain versus coping resources. You can survive suicidal feelings if you do either of two things: (1) find a way to reduce your pain, or (2) find a way to increase your coping resources. Both are possible. Now I want to tell you five things to think about. 1. You need to hear that people do get through this -- even people who feel as badly as you are feeling now. Statistically, there is a very good chance that you are going to live. I hope that this information gives you some sense of hope. 2. Give yourself some distance. Say to yourself, “I will wait 24 hours before I do anything.” Or a week. Remember that feelings and actions are two different things - just because you feel like killing yourself, doesn’t mean that you have to actually do it right this minute. Put some distance between your suicidal feelings and suicidal action. Even if it’s just 24 hours. You have already done it for 5 minutes, just by reading this page. You can do it for another 5 minutes by continuing to read this page. Keep going, and realize that while you still feel suicidal, you are not, at this moment, acting on it. That is very encouraging to me, and I hope it is to you. 3. People often turn to suicide because they are seeking relief from pain. Remember that relief is a feeling. And you have to be alive to feel it. You will not feel the relief you so desperately seek, if you are dead. 4. Some people will react badly to your suicidal feelings, either because they are frightened, or angry; they may actually increase your pain instead of helping you, despite their intentions, by saying or doing thoughtless things. You have to understand that their bad reactions are about their fears, not about you. But there are people out there who can be with you in this horrible time, and will not judge you, or argue with you, or send you to a hospital, or try to talk you out of how badly you feel. They will simply care for you. Find one of them. Now. Use your 24 hours, or your week, and tell someone what’s going on with you. It is okay to ask for help. Try: * Send an anonymous e-mail to The Samaritans * Call 1-800-SUICIDE in the U.S. * Teenagers, call Covenant House NineLine, 1-800-999-9999 * Look in the front of your phone book for a crisis line * Call a psychotherapist * Carefully choose a friend or a minister or rabbi, someone who is likely to listen But don’t give yourself the additional burden of trying to deal with this alone. Just talking about how you got to where you are, releases an awful lot of the pressure, and it might be just the additional coping resource you need to regain your balance. 5. Suicidal feelings are, in and of themselves, traumatic. After they subside, you need to continue caring for yourself. Therapy is a really good idea. So are the various self-help groups available both in your community and on the Internet. Well, it’s been a few minutes and you’re still with me. I’m really glad. Since you have made it this far, you deserve a reward. I think you should reward yourself by giving yourself a gift. The gift you will give yourself is a coping resource. Remember, back up near the top of the page, I said that the idea is to make sure you have more coping resources than you have pain. So let’s give you another coping resource, or two, or ten...! until they outnumber your sources of pain. Now, while this page may have given you some small relief, the best coping resource we can give you is another human being to talk with. If you find someone who wants to listen, and tell them how you are feeling and how you got to this point, you will have increased your coping resources by one. Hopefully the first person you choose won’t be the last. There are a lot of people out there who really want to hear from you. It’s time to start looking around for one of them.",100
gweqxh,"So i am still alive obviously, yesterday was a really dark day for me and i almost did it but then i realized that's not how i wanna leave, without saying goodbye... So i gave myself a week to prepare myself and do it. Anyway i wanna make it clear to you guys, first of all i live in a normal family, i love them so much and we don't really have big problems, and i have friends they love me and so do i, my life is really normal. But i am not happy, i've  never been happy, i don't even know what it feels like. i am 15 but depression knows no numbers, and i  have been depressed for two years and i know some of you may think ""THat's ImPOsibLe"" but that's the thing depression doesn't give a fuck about what you think, also i have this darkness that i can't explain, my mind is so fucked up, the ideas i have are just so fucking wrong, and nobody knows about this, my family, my friends.. they all have no idea and i don't want them to know they've been thru a lot and i don't think they would want to know that there child is depressed and fucked up. Anyway you guys are the nicest people in the world thank you so much, i woke up with a bad headache and buffed eyes, but your comments are so nice and positive, i really really wanna thank you soooo much, you are amazing ♥♥ EDIT: guys again thank you sooo much i don't know what to say, y'all are the nicest people on earth, i appreciate y'all! ♥","Please hold on At your age I was going through the worst psychological pain, result of lots of ptsd that was starting to manifest as bpd.  Shitty parents shitty sibling shitty friends shitty teachers bullies abusive partner etc. I was lucky to have a therapist, though. And I’m *SO* grateful I didn’t kill myself.  It’s never been as bad as when I was 15-16.  So hold on, I promise it will be better",122
gwxhai,"So 2 weeks ago I started doing some inner child work with my therapist which meant sharing a traumatic experience from childhood and the story I shared as just a backstory to the story that I intend to share, made my therapist's jaw drop and go speechless. I never got to the intended story because the back story for context was traumatic enough to need some hashing out, apparently. I guess it just made it more clear how compounded some of the emotional trauma was that my father inflicted on us. I generally find it amusing to see people's reactions when they find out some of the ""mundane"" things my siblings and I went through, not for perverse reasons, just feels kind of validating that it was indeed as crazy as it sounds. Kind of a dark humor or something.  Well today I had another session where I shared another complex/compounded trauma story and my therapist actually teared up and cried a bit for what I went through.  I wasn't exactly expecting that and it honestly made me sad about something I've tried to get over and stop reacting to in any way other than with a dull removed anger. I'm not very good at the inner child visualizations/imagery stuff and feel resistant or something to it, but I definitely felt that little kid pain come on full force after seeing my therapist, who likely deals with tons of other people's traumas, react in such a truly horrified and sad way.  I don't know how to feel about it I guess.  I'm used to sharing snippets of my past to explain my no contact choices in very matter of fact ways and getting the typical, ""I'm sorry that happened,  that makes sense"" type reactions or even sharing in an understanding bond with someone with similar types of trauma about how crazy people can be, but I guess I'm no longer used to sharing old pain from the raw, still open wound perspective. I imagine I'll be reliving a lot of these moments without the comfort of solitude and having to face the reaction of someone else who will confirm how painful it all was and still is. In some ways I'd like to record these reactions and make my father sit through them for each and every one as a way to make him accountable, though I have actually no expectation of him being capable of such a thing.",Thank you for sharing!,23
gyy683,"I was super anxious before going in this morning, I’ve had some pretty crappy past experiences with therapists before and the idea of hashing out all the crap in my head is terrifying in a way.  But the therapist was great (apart from believing that covid is like the measles and everyone will and should eventually get exposed to build up an immune response to it..)  It was really nice to just be listened to for once. Not judged for anything and just acknowledged.  My boyfriend is going to go to the same practice soon so we can eventually have some sessions together, but I feel really good about my first session.  Just wanted to share with someone.  It's a really big deal for me",I’m glad to hear this!!! Makes me feel a lot more enthused to seek for help.,6
gzmc1n,"For context, I started seeing this therapist in May 2019 because I was depressed and generally feeling bad about my life. I told myself I'd invest time and money into this work for a year no matter how hard it gets, and then I'll see whether I want to continue. My therapist has always known this, I told him from the start.  I went through very rough patches during this year, and regularly had panic attacks during and after sessions, which never happened before. All of these were accompanied by immense anger towards my therapist for staying silent and refusing to give me any tools to break from these moments where I felt stuck in my head. He would sometime ask me about my childhood experience with anger, or anxiety, but I never felt like this worsening anxiety was addressed. I made it clear, in spoken words. I stuck with it until May, when I told him that I want us to plan the end of our work. Even though I have a stronger sense of self and better relationships than where I started, I also feel that therapy is now harming me more than it's helping. It takes me several days to a week to recover from sessions. My therapist refused we stop now. He wants to go on until at least September. When asked, he refused to tell me why. He refused to explain what work he felt was still needed. He refused to give me any sense of perspective, or help me understand anything about what we're doing, or why I should still do this to myself. When I describe my most recent panic attacks, and say I don't find this therapeutic, he just nods like he knows something about it but leaves me in the dark entirely. He wants to close out our work properly with some closing sessions, which I want as well, but he wants to decide that time himself.  I feel like I'm going insane. Whenever I think about his silence and my complete lack of understanding of the path our work is taking, I trigger another attack. My mental state is deteriorating, I feel like I'm going crazy. Is it normal for therapists to leave patients in the dark? Am I missing something here? Should I leave him?","Therapist here. Find a new therapist. Your therapist may be highly skilled, empathetic, hard-working, and so forth. That doesn't mean he is the right therapist FOR YOU. At best, you want a level of transparency that he is unable and/or unwilling to provide. At worst, he is taking your money despite an ethical obligation to continuously monitor whether he is helping or not, and act accordingly. There are MANY kinds of therapists, and his methods may work with almost everyone who comes in his office. But, you are an individual, and a better fit for you is out there. When someone tells ME they want to terminate, my first thought is ""How am I failing this person?"" It may be the wrong question, but it is still an important one to ask myself. This always leads to a discussion about what they would like to change about our sessions. If it makes sense to me, I try to accommodate. If it feels forced, or against my own instincts, we terminate. Happy to discuss more here or privately.",92
h014ti,I think my brother sexually assaulted me when I was younger. He came on to me through text recently when he was drunk and may have admitted it. I don’t want to see my immediate family anymore because I think he would shoot me.,"i've been there. never be in a room alone, especially not with him. and if he attacks you do not pick up a weapon because the cops will see you as the perp. pm if you need :) im sorry you have to go through this edit: due to personal reasons i also don't recommend involving the authorities",32
h0wdqd,I’m 20. My little brother was 14. He took his way out a few days ago. The reasons are still unknown. He was the closest person to me. No one else knew me better and vice versa. We grew up together and had the closest brother-to-brother bond. Often he told me how important I was to him and how he looked up to me. No one saw this coming. He was always as energetic and cheerful as a human being can be. He never really showed signs of any serious mental illness/struggle. We are all still in shock. We are being dragged through Hell and back right now. I don’t even have the words to describe this pain. I want to know if anyone here has had to deal with the loss of a very close person. What helped you recover? What stages did you go through between shock and recovery? Do you have any advice for me to help me feel better? I need sympathy/empathy.,"I don't know that anybody is going to find the right words or mold to make you feel better, because nothing will be ""him"" shaped, and I am hugely hugely sorry for that and I cannot imagine. I wish I could just sit in it with you and soak up some of the burden for you.  They say time heals wounds and maybe that is true and I guess it Is what we do with the time that matters. I think that the fact that he was so passionate and outgoing speaks volumes to your influences on him - if you saw that about him, it means he was like that when he was around you. You made him happy. I am a suicide attempt survivor and I can assure you that he did not do it because you were lacking in love or support for him. You are enough and were enough.  Honor him with that personality that gave him happiness and relief and strength. Give it to yourself. Give yourself grace and forgiveness for not knowing how to grieve and be sad about something so huge - there is no handbook. It can take forever but there are stages, and there are degrees of hurt and wounds do heal - right now it is okay to grieve and it is never going to be the wrong time to grieve - you decide the timeline. You do not ever ever have to let him go, he is part of you - and you get to keep and honor him in your heart however you wish. Do not rush this. You cannot give yourself shame in the midst of tragedy - what you are feeling is okay.",37
h7nss1,"There are a few things: \- I can hear her cooking on the stove, using the microwave, and walking around during our telephone sessions. It's so demoralizing to hear that. \- I can hear their roommate or spouse walking around in the same room and making lots noise. \- She is either late by 15-20 minutes, or ends the session 20-30 minutes early every single time. Our last session was only 35 minutes even though I pay for an hour. \- I still haven't had an in person session even though our area has opened up. \- They won't give me a referral to an EMDR therapist or someone to help me with medication management because they haven't been to the office in a few weeks. \- They spend 95% of our session talking. I didn't talk a single time last session except when they asked me how my week has been and saying ""Yeah"" in response to the things they say. \- They send me text messages from their personal phone",The text messages from a personal phone isn’t such an issue. The rest of that is bananas. Dump ‘em.,210
h8tqxj,"I’ve been in therapy for a few months now. I normally attend twice a month at $70 per session.  I don’t feel like I’m getting anything out of it besides an unbiased listening ear. Most sessions she lets me talk and talk and talk and she doesn’t make any suggestions on how to handle the problem or give me a different perspective.  She often summarizes what I said to her and acknowledges my feelings but that’s it. I’ve told her once before I need something to deal with my anxiety so she gave me a paper with questions to ask myself when my anxiety is active. I’m frustrated because I want to do the work to be a better me but she’s not providing the tools. I feel like I’m emotionally raw by the end of the session without much guidance on how to handle the issue. This makes it very difficult to interact with the people I talk about in therapy and makes me feel like I’m being counterproductive by even attending. I have a session Monday so I’m going to talk to her about this.

h9irub,"So I’ve been dealing with a lot the last, give or take, 18 months. I started therapy initially for a different reason and it turned into going to therapy for many other reasons. On Saturday during my video session (because pandemic) she told me that she’s noticed a huge shift in me the last couple sessions and that it showed through a lot in this session.  She said she can tell that I am really learning to put up boundaries and that I am beginning to really see my own self worth and that I am really learning to become, unapologetically me.  I cried. I cried because of the session and the stuff being brought up and discussed, but then I cried happy tears because someone other than my friends sees this change in me.  Progress. Not perfection. That’s the goal.",Yes!! Awesome!,12

hc7ada,"There’s a cute story I tell my friends about our first kiss. Midnight. It was dark except for the moonlight seeping through my blinds. He and I were talking about the things we thought were worth fighting for. I finally get the courage to do it. We share a kiss in my bed. It was my first real kiss.  I left out the part where he would turn away whenever I would avoid his touches. I left out the part where I wasn’t 100% ready when we kissed. I left out the part where I felt uncomfortable when he was touching my breasts. I left out the part where I kissed him because I was scared he would leave if I didn’t.  During our dates, he would lean in forward to kiss me. I would dodge him because I was scared. I wasn’t ready yet. And then it would be days of him giving me the silent treatment. Days where I would stare at my sent messages asking him what’s wrong. Days of silence. Frustration.  There’s plenty more instances. My friends used to tell me he gaslighted me (I defended him). That he coerced me (I said I liked it eventually). That he made me feel bad for not being ready (I would say I just needed to go out of my comfort zone). That it was manipulation (He would never do that). But I’ve loved him for the past two years. I told myself he’s The One That Got Away. I still cry about him to my best friends. Every good thing I’ve accomplished I’ve done with him in the back of my head.  After it ended, I blamed myself for being too much of a prude. That I wasn’t game enough with him. That I didn’t suck his dick when he wanted me to. That I should’ve let him give me head when he wanted to.  I wrote letters (I never sent them) about wanting to start over and doing it right. Blamed myself for everything bad that happened. I still supported his craft quietly because I told him I believed in him and always will. I strive to get better to be right for him when we meet again.  And I’m only realizing now that I may have romanticized the entire relationship to justify the relationship to myself (it was never official). That someone actually cared about me. That the relationship was valid and real.  I feel so heartbroken. And angry. I feel like I have been repeatedly betraying myself the past two years. All those poems. Bettering myself for him. It’s all wrong. I knew before in the back of my head that it was wrong. And yet I’m still in love with him.",I did this too. It's such a mind fuck. My ex was physically  verbally and emotionally abusive and I still pinned after him for years. Maybe you experienced trauma bonding with him. It's so very very confusing,23
hcr81d,"I cannot lie and say that it isn’t difficult, because as a parent, I most often only feel as if I am failing. I feel I am not doing enough, or the right things, especially coparenting and visitations. I feel evil when my children aren’t here. It has been a struggle finding reasons for both subjects to write and present back to her, but as each hour passes of every new day, it becomes much easier to pride myself in my strengths, my ability to provide love and positive parenting techniques, and who I am as a person flows from the deepest corners of my heart and mind. It takes time for sure, and it helps more than I thought it ever could. I chuckled at the thought of it when we first discussed this homework, because I truthfully thought “nothing I tell myself will really change my mind about myself.” I was horribly wrong. We often underestimate the power of the simplest tasks given to us by our therapists, but that’s why they’re the professional and we are still learning to love ourselves. Something as simple as writing “I am good enough” can move a mountain that we’ve been chiseling at for years. Trust the process. It works.","Where do y’all get these great therapists  Oh well, I’ll just use the ideas of yours lol",32

hfep50,"Long story short I’m a biracial, 24 year old female from a predominantly white town. Since the BLM movement has blown up after the unjust death of George Floyd, I’ve been very vocal online about my support. I’ve spent about 5 days each week protesting for hours. But that’s not why I’m exhausted. I’m emotionally burnt out. I cry every day thinking about the state of the world and how so many marginalized people (not even just the black community) are living in constant fear when all that has to happen to change that is quite literally people CHOOSING to be better people and CHOOSING to change as a society. Because quite literally nothing is keeping us living this way except ourselves. Almost everything we do is based on a human’s idea- paying rent, working 40 hours a week, etc. I feel like NOTHING i am doing is changing anything. And I know my feelings are valid but also, I see other people living carefree like nothing is happening right now and it hurts because it makes me feel like they don’t care about ME. I’ve cut off many friends I’ve known since middle school for not voicing support for the movement because it’s quite literally a fight for MY civil and human rights as a BLACK woman. It hurts reading things online from people I loved opposing my freedoms and supporting my oppression. It hurts realizing these people I have always adored and supported have been thinking less of me this whole time because of the color of my skin. I am crumbling. And no amount of self-reflecting can tell me what the right thing to do is. I can’t take this anymore. I can’t cry myself to sleep every night and put on a brave face tomorrow watching videos of people who look like me and the people i love being murdered. I can’t get online and see entire thinkpieces about how myself and my black brothers + sisters are “thugs” or “animals”. I know despite these ignorant people, the world is still progressing in little ways but it doesn’t feel like it enough... I don’t understand how anyone could support the unjust treatment of any human regardless of gender, racer, sexual orientation, etc. We have ONE life. Why shouldn’t we each be able to live it how we want without the constraints of judgement from others or even worse, systemic oppression. Realizing how many people are just hateful for no valid reason is quite literally killing me... Anyways, I’m bipolar and was THRIVING mentally before this started but now I have regular thoughts of suicide again. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to exist in a world of hatred. I dont want to feel inferior or live knowing people around me think see me that way. I’m exhausted and I really can’t do this anymore. I feel I need to move out of this town and maybe i’ll find more like-minded people. But I don’t have the money (or social skills lol). I was laid off during covid which was a blessing in disguise because i realized i hated my career (waste of 4 years of college) and i needed time to breathe but I don’t have a job to keep me busy so I spend most of my energy at the gym trying to at least feel good about myself which isn’t working because my self-esteem is eternally in the garbage no matter what. I don’t even want to hang out with the few friends I have left because I just don’t have the energy. And when I do hang out with them, all I have to talk about is protesting because that’s all I’ve been doing. And I know that’s not enjoyable for everyone. I’ve made a few new ones but my social anxiety makes me terrified I’ll disappoint them when they get to know me or they just won’t like me. It’s all just a lot at once. It’s mostly the world stuff that’s bothering me (i think) but all the other everyday shit on top of it is just so heavy i haven’t gotten out of bed all day except to stress eat. I know I sound dramatic because I know it’s a global movement and it’s WAY bigger than me but the reality of it is, it affects people like me personally. On an individual level. At first I was hurt. Then I was angry. Now I’m just sad... I don’t want to live in a world like this anymore🥺",Hi.,9
hfmjpi,"I had no siblings, and was very close with my extended family. I was especially close to one cousin that spent most days at our house. When I was 10, my mum had an argument with my aunt, and I never saw my extended family again. I did not even recieve any birthday cards or messages from them. I was a very lonely teen and missed them so much. I presumed they didn't love me, in reality they probably didn't want any contact with my mum. My mum can be difficult. It's been twenty years and I tried to make myself feel better by reasoning that anyone that could cut off a child like must be an awful person. Then recently, my gran died. I was not told about the funeral arrangements. I found my cousin on social media and saw that she had a great relationship with our gran and that our gran had loved her dearly, which really hurt. I contacted my cousin and told her that I want to reconnect with my extended family and that whatever my mum had done had nothing to do with me, but my cousin doesn't want anything to do with me. She said that my gran never stopped loving me, and blamed me for losing contact with her (I was a child, and thought they had cut off contact with my mum AND me.) I know this isn't a huge thing to be upset about, but I feel abandoned all over again and it feels so unfair. I missed out on growing up with family.

hh8ht4,"So I had a Grindr hookup earlier today. As soon as I got there, he got naked, and let me into his bedroom. I've been out of the country for months and haven't had any hookups, and having a lot of sexual energy pent up, I was excited at first, and went along with it. He started twisting my nipples pretty hard, which I didn't like, but went along with it. Then he told me to suck his dick, which I did, then proceeded to stick his dick in me. I hadn't prepared and also didn't want to be fucked, but the first time he did it, I was kind of thrown off, and just let it happen. After like 30 seconds, I told him to stop, because it hurt, and he didn't get out of me, then after another minute or two, I finally got him to get off me. We fooled around for another few minutes, and then he put his dick in me again. This happened multiple times over about 20/30 minutes. I kept telling him, I'm not really down for this, I'm not prepared, it's been a long time, and I'm not ready, and he just kept doing it, and trying to convince me that it was fine. It really hurt, and eventually he got up and put his clothes on. I stupidly apologized and he said ""it's fine, I still got what I wanted."" I really don't know how to feel or what to do. I feel gross and violated. I don't know if I should message him, or what. Am I overreacting? I'm also like not crying or freaking out, so I don't know if I'm not reacting enough? Also, I can't help but feel like it's my fault this happened. He was pretty aggressive and I felt really uncomfortable, but I could have been a lot more firm, and actually gotten up and tried to leave. I just don't know what to do/feel...I'm feeling pretty fucked up by this.","Something like this happened to a friend of mine. Same situation basically. It took them months to even tell us it happened because they also weren't sure it was rape. It was. You told him repeatedly to stop, and he deliberately hurt you anyways. I am so, so sorry this happened to you. Just because you were initially excited to have sex, does not negate that you wanted it to stop, and your very reasonable requests - stop hurting me, slow down, wait a minute - were willfully ignored. Sex should contain constant and enthusiastic consent to be considered a healthy encounter.

hjfekf,"I got hired today at a local takeaway that I've been going to since I was a kid. I never thought I'd be mentally stable enough to get a job!! This is my first one. I was in hospital two weeks ago after trying to commit suicide so hopefully this is a new beginning and a chance to move past the hurt and on to the next chapter of life!! Just thought I'd share that with you all and tell you that there IS hope ❤️ UPDATE: It went great!!! The people there showed me what to do and they were so kind and patient with me. They gave me free food before I left and reassured me throughout the day that I can ask any question, big or small, that I couldn't possibly get everything right on the first day and to take it slow! They praised me for chopping some lettuce and an onion and turns out we have loads in common - we all like horse racing. They knew me to see me because I'm local. I think I'm in heaven ❤️",Congrats!!! I just landed a job today too (: now I work at staples! I love retail and it’s been hard being mentally unwell with a criminal background but staples looked past that and gave me a chance ,28
hjvujx,"Just as a heads-up, if you're looking for an inspirational/feel-good story...this post probably ain't it. I just feel kind of ashamed, and like I have to get this off my chest. I started therapy a few months ago to try and deal with some serious self-esteem, anxiety, and depression issues. Almost all of those stemmed from relationship/intimacy issues; namely, my lack thereof. I've never had a girlfriend, never even kissed anyone at the age of 26. And it's definitely not for lack of trying. I got on the whole self-improvement kick in an attempt to get myself in a better place where I might have some success trying to date. But that didn't seem to have any affect, and so I decided that therapy was the last option I had left. Especially considering how much the depression centering around this issue was starting to really burn other areas of my life. So I started online sessions and the results were...mixed, to say the least. I didn't last long with my first therapist. That wasn't really any fault of her own, to be completely fair. I think that whatever algorithm this site used to match you to therapists/counselors went haywire, because I got connected with a therapist who specialized in things like eating disorders and OCD. We both kinda realized that early on and she recommended trying someone else. The second one started off fairly promising. She talked about incorporating techniques from CBT, exposure therapy, etc. At first I thought we were off to a good start until about two weeks in. She started to talk about things like chi, and how a ""common energy"" connected every living being on earth, how I had to find ""the being who balances your energy"". I pretty quickly realized that this wasn't what I was looking for, and wasn't doing me any good. The third therapist was just 100% convinced that I had some severe childhood trauma that I wasn't revealing to him, and that it was the root cause of all my current problems. I tried explaining that no, my childhood was actually pretty great all things considered, and that these problems really only started to show up in the past six years or so. But this guy was just dead-set on the idea that I'd suffered some sort of horrendous trauma early in life. I stopped seeing him after a few weeks. I had some hope with my final therapist. She seemed very level-headed and took a slightly more ""practical"" approach to my problems. After a few sessions just to establish some goals and what I wanted out of therapy she recommended some things that I could try, especially when it came to building confidence and self-esteem. Namely exercising, making healthy diet changes, finding new hobbies, etc. But we hit a bit of a wall, because well...I'd already done all of those things before starting therapy. And it felt like nothing had changed. I was still just as shy, introverted, and terrified of people (especially women) as I was before. We kept trying for another month or so, but last week I just realized nothing was working. I sent her a message thanking her for her time and trying to help, and at least she seemed understanding about why I wanted to ""take a break"" from therapy, although she tried to convince me to stay. But I just wasn't getting anything out of it. I'm sorry this post is so long but to be perfectly honest I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. Therapy was basically my ""last ditch"" effort, y'know? I've tried everything I can think of but never saw any real tangible results. I'm just as single as always and hating myself because of it. I know that people say ""you have to love yourself before you can love someone else"", but frankly it's pretty hard to love myself first when nobody's ever shown me that I'm worthy of that. And now I'm back at square one. Sorry, just needed to vent a bit. I'll shut up now.","Your reaction is understandable but probably rushed.  Going through your comment history, I get the sense that although your anxiety and depression may have started as a result of not having relationships, they have now taken a life of their own. If you are having panic attacks in social situations like running clubs or painting classes, you need the help of a good therapist to help you deal with that.  It's understandable that you are impatient but you really need to scale down your expectations for a while. You expect too much too fast both from yourself and the therapist.  You also seem to be thinking ""if only i get a relationship all the anxiety and depression will magically disappear"". Unfortunately if you got a relationship all the anxiety, depression and self-hate would make it very difficult for the both of you. You have to take care of yourself before tackling connecting to another.  For a while you should focus on developing connections and friendships with no ulterior sexual motive. Keep it light. Go to the classes and clubs you go. With the help of a good therapist make an exposure therapy plan and practice (your last therapist wasn't half bad). Even the tiniest social progress is good.   This is not a magical process where a therapist says something and suddenly the clouds part and decades of maladaptive behavioral patterns and thought miraculously disappear. Social situations will remain painful for you for quite a while. You will have to practice, to stay in the moment, to tolerate discomfort, to slowly build your tolerance. It's a bit like muscle training but very slow. The therapist is there to talk you through the rough patches, point out thought distortions, celebrate small victories and make sure you don't overwhelm yourself.  It doesn't sound very appealing but I'd say reconsider. You may not see it right now but having a trained experienced ally can make your path a lot easier and faster.",39

hkp4or,"Im not sure what im looking for posting this here. I cant see my therapist until the end of july so i think im mostly trying to get my feelings out and try to process this.  I met this girl i work with back in september and developed a crush on her. We have hung out as friends, going to a look out over our city, smoking weed and talking some after we work together.  About two weeks ago i was struggling with feeling and wondering if she had any feelings for me. so i talked to her for clarity like my therapist suggested, confessed i liked her, and she reacted well to it. Said she has thought about it before, and likes talking and seeing me. we both admitted neither of us are ready for a relationship now. She just got out of something toxic and im dealing with issues of anxiety and depression. We agreed to continue hanging out like we have been, get to know each other and see what happens.   So later that week, i follow her on snapchat and saw her location pinged outside the hospital and disappeared after 8hrs and she wasnt on for a whole week. I started to worry she was in an accident or god forbid her ex came around and did something.  Just this last monday i saw her at work and she filled me in that she was in the hospital and had overdosed on sleeping pills and it wasnt an accident! I was completely shocked and at a loss for words. I just keep thinking the cliche thing everyone says “she didnt seem that upset, she seemed so happy”.  I realize everyone problems are different and many are worse than what i have and had. Im just having trouble wrapping my mind around the whole thing. The fact i saw her the night before it happened and that could have been the last time. I keep playing the scenario of the cops and paramedics breaking in her place and rushing her to the hospital, many other thoughts, and its breaking my heart. Even thinking about the people that truly love her and how they feel.  Im not even that close to her and it hurts me to see her or anyone in the position to think taking their life is an option.  At this point im not even worried about dating her or making a move or anything. I do still want to be friends and see her outside of work, but dont want it to seem like im being inconsiderate of her situation if i try and reach out to get together and hang out with her.   Im really not sure what to do if anything. Im thinking about her even more than before and just wish i could do something if anything to make her feel better.  I just dont know anymore. Thank you to anyone who reads this long post.",You sound like a really great friend! Keep doing what you’re doing. Don’t forget to take care of yourself in this situation too!

hlt0iw,"I'm a twelve-year-old in 7th grade and I might have a mental disorder, I know a lot of kids like to claim that they have mental disorders to get attention but I just need someone to know about my situation.  Ever since I was a baby I have always been very distrusting of others. I never wanted to talk to my teachers, when my friends' parents ( if I was able to make friends) were about to leave and my mom told me to say bye I would just look at them, etc. My parents don't think much of it.  I had an amazing time in school and I was making astounding grades, but that all changed in 5th grade. I was dreading this teacher for the whole Summer because I knew the kind of stuff she did to kids. I 4th grade I heard her yelling from across the hall. So many kids wanted to mill themselves in 5th grade.  ( Well, it was a lot for a small private school, anyways.)  I was genuinely scared for 5th grade. But when I walked in the door she was really nice to me. A wave of relief went over me. I thought I would be fine for the whole year!  I was wrong. Very wrong. I swear she was bipolar. A joke that would make her laugh one day would offend her the next day. She would publically humiliate me in front of the class as well as other kids. Whenever my mom emailed her that I wouldn't be going to school that day, she would get angry and give an F on everything that day. I tried not to miss school that much. But I couldn't! I would have constant anxiety attacks about her. My family didn't have enough money to send me to therapy again (That stuff is expensive!!) so they just tried to give me some more medications. But, how far can medication go when you have an abusive teacher? I remember halfway through the year just becoming numb. I had no one to tell about it. No one could save me. I was not me. Not even close. I am currently in 7th grade and experiencing PTSD from it all. (I think...I haven't actually been diagnosed with anything.) At the start of the coronavirus quarantine, I started to have hallucinations. Most auditory.  Sometimes I hear a voice in my head telling me random stuff, other times I would feel a tap on my shoulder but no one would be there, and sometimes I see a shadow of someone in the corner of my eye. I also have flashbacks from 5th grade. I figured the only place I could go to is Reddit. I don't know what to do.",Please be very careful and safe about posting on the internet,43

It never goes on for more than a minute or two but it’s super annoying and awkward.  Does anyone else’s T do that as well? What do you DO with the silence?,"Sometimes therapists use silence in a therapeutic fashion- Allowing the Clt to process what we’ve said, think on what you want to say next, or allow folks to grieve if we’re doing grief/trauma therapy.

hn5l53,"As I realised through therapy how every action you take, everything you feel comes from past experiences or environment  and that you can track a pattern and deal with it, I find myself always wanting to improve and be aware of everything I do until it becomes exhausting. I'm tired of trying to make sense of everything, being careful with words, wondering if it's an overreaction or if I'm allowed to feel a certain way. I want to stop caring and live a normal life.","It is good to track back how restrictive patterns came to be.  To realize they are survival strategies and not flaws.  Then the real work begins with drumming up the courage to let them go.  It can feel very threatening to do this.  One thing I have found immensely helpful is to commit in the morning to let the day unfold naturally, with no manipulation from me to change it (I don't mean practical choices related to bills or work).   If my ego feels threatened by an imagined sense of worthlessness or abandonment, I don't follow what my mind tells me to do to assuage the perceived threat.

hnth2u,"A few years ago this girl had sex with me while I was black out drunk. She was drunk too but it wasn't really a big deal to her. She was going through a period of being depression where she got drunk and had sex with random people. It really messed me up for awhile. After it happened I tried reaching out to her about it. She was an acquaintance and we shared a friend. After this I reached out to her to ask if she wanted to be friends. I wanted her to make me feel better but I wasn't sure how. She said ""nah im good. I dont need anymore friends."". This felt beyond shitty. I felt used. Whatever. Those first few days I was crazy anxious. I had random moments where I remembered patches of that night. Eventually I move out of town and my anxiety subsided for awhile. I was super busy but my mind would go to that place whenever I had any downtime. It seemed like any time I felt down my mind would fall into a pit of that night. I can't explain the level of my anxiety. It was all consuming. I kept constantly remembering those little patches of memories and how she treated me.  I started drinking an increasing amount. I actually sent her a few drunk texts about it, on multiple nights. I don't remember her first few responses but they always felt shitty. Eventually she said ""I'm sorry I dont remember."" That was that.  I got a specific tattoo on a sensitive part of my body to remind me to stay calm and not be anxious. I really focused on the pain of the tattoo and I looked at it every time I felt anxiety. My anxiety stopped.  Her being a friend of a friend. I'd see her when I came into town. I fixated on her when I came back home. I actually paid more attention to her than the friend I actually came to hang out with. I was like I mentally highlighted everything she did to me that was nice. Wow, she handed me a drink. She showed some basic human consideration for me. I was constantly finding these things as though it'd make me feel better in a way that I didnt understand. It was like I was looking for an answer that I didnt know the question too. Fast forward, our shared friend died. In the pain or this, I was around that girl a lot. I felt like this thing with her came back up. Both issues, my friends death and being around her were equally large weights on my neck. I saw how she had all of these friends come to her and comfort her, while I'm mostly a loner. I felt like this made her a good person. I'm weird for being hurt. I shouldn't have felt the way I did but I couldn't stop it.  My (dead) friend's family wants us to all keep and touch and have nights together but I've decided not to. I am certain that I will see this girl and continue to be in touch with her if I do keep in touch with everyone else. I shouldn't put their needs above my own. I shouldn't have to be around her. It doesn't feel good.  I haven't specifically told her that I'm cutting contact yet. I'll plan to let her know if she ever reaches out to me again.  The thought of never seeing her brings me solace but I worry about if she reaches out to me in the future.","I think this is being kind to yourself. I'm similar with men - if they demonstrate in some way that they care for me I latch onto it, which usually drives them away! And I end up feeling used and discarded. I've realized recently that both of these things are triggers for needs/traumas in my past and if I can look at it more objectively I can help myself to deal with those needs and traumas myself without dragging someone else into it. At the same time though, objectively I can see that what this person triggered in me was not treating me with respect, and that is an absolute essential criteria for even an acquaintance.

And if I start I can make it symmetrical. And I’m embarrassed because of it. My parents won’t stop asking but when I told them about it a while ago my mom basically made fun of me and now she also won’t stop asking about “what’s wrong with me” So this therapist lady came by to analyze us so we can better understand our “problems” and my mom brought it up again. And because I’m embarrassed about it I was able to come up with the, in my opinion, best lie. And then why lie if I wanna get better. Well mainly because I don’t want to have to constantly explain it to people that will make fun of it And I’ve also talked to my actual therapist about it but she didn’t understand so that sucks.","If your therapist doesn't understand or perhaps even refuses to try to understand what you are trying to tell them, maybe it's time for a new therapist.",43
hpe6ei,"I just started tele-therapy two weeks ago, never had therapy before. General anxiety/depression stuff. My first appointment was fine, just intake stuff, but my therapist forgot to keep our second appointment a week later. We agreed on the time and everything, she just never put it in the system, so I never got the call.  I left her a message asking about it, and she returned my call the next day. Apparently, she had just returned from vacation a few days before my first appointment and she had some scheduling issues. She seemed to have genuinely forgotten about it, and after looking through her records told me ""I see you were supposed to be scheduled and you weren't...so that's my bad"". Honestly, it made me laugh. I'm willing to continue longer with her because she seemed to know what she was talking about in the intake, but I wanted to know if anyone else here had any similar experiences with therapists being surprisingly unprofessional.

hpp9fg,"My mom sometimes gets really angry to the point when she might throw something, break something or hit the wall/door or anything in her way. She usually yells at me too while doing that. It can be about anything , even silly arguments could turn that way. Many times before, when my sisters were not home, my mom would be really angry and scream at me or hit things angrily. It scared me to the point where I had to hide in the bathroom and cry because she wouldn’t stop. It would happen a lot. This caused me to start crying and panicking and gasping for air whenever she raises her voice at me. Today, we had a dumb argument and she raised her voice at me angrily and hit the door really hard and that’s when I started sobbing like crazy for about 20 minutes and I didn’t wanna talk to anybody. Whenever I get that way, I completely lose control of myself and I end up scratching my skin really hard nonstop till it hurts and it gets red.  My sister told me that my mom felt bad afterwards and that she was scared I was going to hurt myself.","It sounds like you’re just trying to cope with what is actually a really scary situation. My mother was very temperamental and would go 0 to 100, and smash things and scream, which as a child/young adult is scary. Our mothers are meant to be nurturing rather than terrifying. What I believe you’re experiencing is a maladaptive coping mechanism; self harm. I can relate very deeply. I think you’re trying to deal with all of your emotions by self harming (the outcome of the emotion, not specifically about the intention to hurt oneself), which is common and also nothing to be ashamed of. Because you cannot reason with your mother, you’ve found a different outlet and method to deal with it, because she hasn’t shown you how to deal with emotion. We learn how to emotionally regulate from our parents, and if they can’t emotionally regulate or override their emotional reactions with reason, then unfortunately it’s very difficult for the child to learn how to deal effectively with emotions. I’m not a psychologist at all, I just highly relate to your experience, both as the child and mother. I have a daughter, and I find it difficult to regulate my emotions and have gotten angry in front of her before. But the guilt and devastation of upsetting my child outweighs my personal ego, so I made a decision to break the cycle and be the emotionally stable and loving parent my child needs. I’m able to talk about this with her, and I listen to how she feels, because I also remember what it felt like for me. I don’t think about blame placing, it’s about understanding and validating your child. The thing is, your mother has to stop being defensive and recognise that it is her actions, insecurities and emotional dysregulation that are a problem, and that she needs to change. But she has to recognise it and admit it before she can actually improve. I’m so disheartened to hear that she won’t engage in communication with you, and I’m so sorry you have to experience this. It’s not up to you to teach your mother how to communicate effectively, she is the one who is meant to be teaching you.  I just want you to know that you’re not at fault here, and it’s very normal to panic when your mother raises her voice - it’s scary. I see that you’re young, and I want you to know that it will get better for you, and you won’t be trapped in an environment that’s invalidating or scary for long. Practice self care and know that things will not be like this forever. I would suggest seeking some type of support, if only just to vent and have somebody validate your emotions, because it’s easy to get lost in that kind of household and feel like you’re the one that’s wrong and crazy, but you’re not.",39
hq1qgf," I know that I am likely in the small minority of victims who feel this way but I also don't look at myself as a ""victim"". Yes I was taken advantage of and abused with power and control and pressure to do favors but I just don't see myself that way, and I feel for those who have suffered worse or under worse terms. ( Link for My story if you want to get some background to my situation. contact me) Yes I have come to terms with it being labelled s abuse but again I also dont see myself as a victim because I feel I could have stopped it sooner, and I was not r a p e or physically abused to do the things, I know thats not the only thing that makes someone a victim I just personally choose to look beyond that. But yes I see this person G lets call him maybe once a year or so and nothing has ever been said or anything about those past moments, but Im sure he remembers it just as I did and maybe feels bad about it or maybe has just sort of grown up and moved past it in his own way. I try not to think about it more just to heal and share my story with others on reddit or anonymously. Maybe that is another reason is I have never told ANYONE in my life and im sure it is the same for him. I chose to live with it, reflect on it and grow, yes it took years and yes it took looking down on myself, shame, regret, embarrassment etc. However I also used to blame it for having attractions to men and exploring with men and having bi attractions and desires. That also I have come to terms with just being me and being natural.That i would be that way regardless but as I said I used to look at that as the worse thing to come from this. I also wonder whether it was me also feeling very ashamed that it was another guy I was exploring with and how that was culturally and just around my peers looked at as wrong, and gay as wrong, bi as wrong, and being very judged and hated on. So that was another reason to keep that very hidden but also the abuse hidden because they were tied together for me. I used to tie them together as me being double wrong and doing double the shame and regretful things. Peers and pressure and cultures and religion and just judgement from others shaped many peoples lives and preferences and feelings and just hiding being themselves but I definitely think for myself it was even more looked down on and made me extra careful and hidden. As the years went by I got to learn and explore and be myself and do what I want to do but also with regret and shame in the early teen and 20s. Now 10-20 years later I look back on it that I should have enjoyed those moments I was in and not have been so ashamed and fearful and embarrassed, I think I would have been more free and expressive and enjoyed the experiences more but I also don't regret doing what I have done and explored with who I have... It has made me learn more about me and my likes and desires and be able to just be me and enjoy life. Its still a hidden side from the public and people I know.. but for me its about accepting myself that is more important than others accepting me for who I am. So the hate and anger went to just being normal and accepting all that happened and who I am. Sure I feel a little regret about not living my life truly for who I am... but I think accepting myself for who I am is more important than s escapades and fun. I do try to enjoy my life now for every moment and every opportunity and that is what I want others to do as well who have suffered s abuse or any abuse or trauma as a child. I want them to grow and be happy and loving people, be able to enjoy hugs, touches, kisses, intercourse and not be forever traumatized.

hszi7o,"I'm always thinking of ways to kill my brother. he's so repulsive and lazy and gross and disgusting, a full on neckbeard at 12 pissing in bottles and not knowing simple hygiene, doesn't shower and doesn't know how to dress himself, goes around in flip flops and 4 year old track pants and a stupid hoodie when he has very good clothes that look and fit him well. he's always going through my things and getting away with making messes and breaking things while I get in trouble for his mistakes. he knows no boundaries and WILL grab something outta your mouth to eat it from you. will fight for the smallest things and breaks and ruins everything he looks at. I get beat up for his stuff while he barely gets beat.   sometimes I want to break one of his limbs and watch him cry, I want to bash his head with a heavy party size icecream tub. I enjoy hearing him cry and suffer. its really hard to live with him. I remember once my grandma said ""I drank some of the apple juice in your room, thank you"" to traumatize him out of pissing in water bottles??! lie what the FUCK is wrong with him? I have no privacy in this house, he once broke my glass window when I was joking with him. its so hard to live with someone who doesn't understand how unlikable he is. Whenever people come over they stay in my room because of how gross he is. I want his eyes pulled out and his guts snipped with dull scissors. its so hard to live like this, he gets (away with) everything! how do I stop these thoughts?","Professional psychological/psychiatric treatment ASAP. If he's the only one who triggers you like this, I'd suggest staying at someone else's house until you can get that. If you feel like you're at risk of seriously hurting him/anyone else in the near future, you should be checked into inpatient treatment immediately. Also... you mentioned getting ""beat up for his stuff."" Are you a minor that's being physically abused? If so, US-based?",73
ht1sy4,"I have been going to the same therapist for about a year and a half now. I really liked her and I recently reached a breakthrough in my life while seeing her. I pay out of pocket and its kind of pricey for me bit i still go twice a month. Shes always been great with me and very kind etc except yesterday.  I will say because of some issues i have im very hard to open up to people even a therapist. Either way I feel like at times she was bored with our discussions but still listened until i finally started opening up recently. Yesterday she was constantly looking at the clock while i was talking which is fine but also makes me feel rushed. I paid her and she offered me hand sanitizer.  I was just making small talk as i walked out her room and she walked me out her office and down the corridor to leave until we reached the waiting room and door. I was finishing what i was saying and was about to say goodbye and she snapped "" I have another client coming sorry"" it was very shocking to me because i didnt ask her to a) walk me out and b) I didnt want to just walk silently with her thru the building. I thought it was very uncalled for as she also seemed angry like how dare you speak to me when im not being paid.  I had a wave of embarrassment wash over me after she did that and i just walked away from her. I was actually so upset that i pulled over crying when driving home. My question is I don't want to see her after this, do i text her my problem or just cancel and never go back? I know it doesnt sound that bad as i type it but it was very very upsetting me as I felt she was mad I was small talking with her as we walked.","Hi there. While she obviously could have been a lot more sensitive in how she told you she had another client coming, she may have just been having a bad day and not choosing her words and tone wisely.  I would text and say something like ""when you snapped at me that you had another client coming, it really hurt my feelings. I don't know if it bothered you that I was making small talk, and I didn't mean for it to, but if we could talk this out sometime, that would be great."" She might honestly really feel bad about it and want to smooth things over.  If she dismisses your hurt feelings, then it might be time to find a new therapist.",105

I even had tears in my eyes reading through some top posts cause they just hit a spot i couldnt describe before.

hugis6,How fucked up is that,"In Australia, at least, there are many free services that offer therapy (I work for one). I'd imagine there would be in other countries too. Worth a google search. For example we have DV connect, 1800 Respect, Kids Helpline, Lifeline, Family Relationship Advice Line, Parent Line, Beyond Blue, Homeless Persons Information, Q Life, plus a heap of alcohol and drug counselling services. As well as being free a lot of them are open 7 days a week. The service I work for is 24/7 and completely free. In Australia we also have mental health care plans and providers that provide free face to face psychologist appointments. There are issues with it, for example the psychs don't get paid much and usually don't stick around for long, and there is a limit to the complexity that they deal with. So complex cases often see private psychologists, the government gives a rebate of approx $100 per session so people tend to be out of pocket $80. Not a perfect system, but we are very fortunate to have a society and government that supports services like these so that people most in need get help.",31

hwhyq5,"for context she thinks i may have ptsd and im diagnosed with depression and anxiety (potential childhood trauma but memory v unclear?) and she constantly refers to a “little girl” that im trapping inside me & not letting her do what she wants. and things like “i think the little girl inside you would be upset to hear you say that”. i think i kind of get it but is there an explanation to it? could she referring to something like freezing in childhood? i probably should ask her but i never get around to it and its become like an established term that it feels weird to bring up now lol. also finding that she doesn’t straight up explain things like this to me, like what specifically makes her think i could have ptsd and stuff. but also scared to ask. because do i want to know? lol","She may be referring to your “inner child.” A lot of trauma work, even without childhood trauma, talks about your “inner child” a lot.

hwwpg6,"Whenever I say something negative, it’s like the default response. My previous therapist used to say it, half my friends have said it, whenever I look something up, it’s one of the first things I see; It’s your depression talking, it’s your mental illness lying to you, your depression is lying to you, your depression is making you think these things, your depression is warping your thinking. It’s your depression, not YOU. Never YOU. Because it can’t actually be ME that thinks something, and it can’t actually be MY feelings. Yeah, sure, it changes you. I get it. But it doesn’t completely invalidate you. It doesn’t invalidate your feelings or your thoughts or your opinions. I’m just sick of hearing it, it always feels so dismissive. It just feels too much like “that’s crazy, and if it’s crazy, I don’t have to listen to you”. Does anyone else feel like that?","Well, the reality is that most of the time it is indeed your depression talking, and not YOU. Take those comments as a snap, a click to come back to reality, to get out of that negative thinking.  Im sure you feel bad, you feel those feelings. But those feelings are influenced by your thoughts, your mind. Your negativity is not in you, in your situation, nor around you. You can't touch it. It is your MIND overthinking and creating a sad story. Look around you. Yes, right now :) Where is the negativity? Do you see it? No right? It is your mind taking over. It is sooooo addictive and masochistic comforting to stay in these negative moods we create, that we don't allow for people to try to take us out of it. Almost offensive to us: 'how dare you?"", right?  Don't see it as a way to invalidate what you feel. That shit feels damn real to us. But see it as a wake up call that there is a way out. And usually starts by changing how we think (or stop thinking for that matter). Which will lead to how we feel..and then how we act...and the rest is history. :) (I too have been diagnosed clinical depression).",22

hynk0w,"I would love to hear the best advice you got from your therapist. I love seeing my therapist, even though its pricey, it's so worth the investment. I had/still have to extent an obsession of wanting everyone to like me, don't know why exactly (if someone can tell me why). The best piece of advice I got from my therapist is whether I stand by my actions and words in a particular situation, he calls it the ""mirror test"". If I can stand in front of a mirror and stand by my actions and they're in line with my values, then it's all good. If I like myself and I know who I am, then nobody, especially people who don't know me nor love me, shouldn't have any power over me to tell me who I am.","Best advice: when I'm overwhelmed, use the acronym HALT and ask myself am I Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired. Then, once identified, ask myself, ""What do I need to do to take care of myself?"" Identifying my needs helped me tremendously in learning how to function in the world (instead of just existing in my head.)",76

hz7fdp,"I have been noticing that the older I get the more reserved I’m becoming. I feel like I used to be this energetic and enthusiastic person. Always cheerful and with a smile on my face. I didn’t feel good on the inside though, depressed since 12 years of age and high anxiety. I used to hide it so well. No one could ever tell I was depressed. However the older I got the more I started sharing with my friends. I told them about my depression and my anxiety. I told them about my past trauma and issues. Things seemed great between us - we were more vulnerable and honest. But lately they have been opening up more and I have been shutting off. I don’t feel excited to talk to them like I used to. I feel exhausted and I can’t hide behind a smile like I used to. When we hang out I feel drained and I don’t know if it’s them or me or cause of work. I am working like 10-12 hours a day and on weekends sometimes on my own company - it’s been draining. But like this weekend we hung out and then after a friend messaged me saying I was off this weekend like not like my usual happy go lucky self. I just don’t know if it’s me or them or people stopped exciting me....  Why can’t I be happy and feel the moments when I am with them? Why can’t I uncover joy in the moments we meet? I feel like distant and not needed in the group anymore...","Yup sounds like depression, likely not clinical or chemical, though.  I'd venture to say your subconscious knows you need to move on from certain people/things, and is manifesting (communicating with you) this via depression, via this feeling of pervasive ennui.  Sounds like it's time for some change in your life! You can either resist and stay in this state (which will likely get worse) or you can embrace it with excitement for what's next in life. Depression **can be** your friend.  Before anyone snaps at me saying that, I have bipolar and C-PTSD so I'm pretty well versed in depression, lol, and I do my best to share what I've learned along my wretched journey.  Sometimes depression is my enemy, sometimes I can see it as a kindness. Just like my tummy rumbles and hurts when I'm hungry, I try to listen to my emotions and what they're saying, and of course then try to remedy it like I would remedy hunger pangs with food. I wish you the best ✌️",19

She knows what to say, and has made my life better since she's been seeing me. The only problem is that I'm a 19 year old transgender man, and even though she is totally okay with that and plans to help me in my transition, she still refers to me as ""she"" and my dead-name. The funny thing about it is that she's never known me as a female. The only way she knows that I was female is by the name on my chart and my pre-transition body/voice. I have confronted her about this and she apologizes and for the rest of the session is correct in my pronouns and name, but it doesn't stick.

i3ozh7,"That title sounds so douchey to me and this whole post is probably gonna be the same, so I'm sorry about that, but I just realized this this week: I always need to be the best at everything, even if it's something I don't care about. And obviously there's gonna be things that I just can't be the best at, and when that happens I, without realizing that's what I'm doing, convince myself that they're only better than me at it because they worked harder, but that if I worked as hard as them I would have definitely been just as good and better. Which is obviously not true for a lot of things.  At school I was always top in class and never did much work really. That made me proud to be honest, and now I think it's just messed up a bunch of my thoughts/beliefs. The classes were never so competitive, and in the school I went to there weren't any 'honors' classes or anything. So I think all that stuff just went to my head, and now I think way too highly of myself, yet at the same time still don't at all. Weirdly full of myself and insecure at the same time. I could talk more about that now but one thing at a time. Anyways now I can never seem to wrap my head around the fact that someone can be just simply more talented/ naturally better at something than me. Someone smarter than me I can easily see cause I don't think I'm so smart really, so that hasn't been a problem. Just the 'naturally better at XY' is what I can't ever get. I could write more but today has been rough and this is a bit exhausting. Maybe another day.  For context: I'm 17 turning 18.

I'm placing too high standards on myself and I feel like if I don't meet them then... all the suffering was in vain, at least for the university stuff. Other stuff a bit more complicated.  Just... how do I stop being such an idiot? And become more truly humble?","mindful practice, breath work, engagement in creative activities, journaling also to document your progress, document gratitude, revitalize your appreciation for the small things. Anger & negative self talk can be debilitating, automatic negative thoughts (ANTS) come into play when you are in survival mode- in your head is technically correct. Patterns of thought develop from stress, those patterns of thought will start to effect your behaviors and your feelings- both about yourself and others. You literally have to RETRAIN your brain, since it is wired for survival, and you are a complex being in a complex modern world your brain wants to solve and predict problems to keep you safe and happy... remind it what really matters with simple mindful journaling- I think that is the most effective, and quickest evidential process to feeling better.",14

i6l62q,"I always feel extreme guilt over minor things that I usually have no control over. or feel second handed guilt in the place of others. Today, my sisters and I ordered some food from a place (first time) and it turned out to be two hours late. The restaurant is extremely close by (a maximum of 15 minutes away) and it's early in the day where there's not a lot of customers. The delivery guy got lost at some point, after the first hour and a half and repeatedly sending them our location, we called customer service and told them to cancel our order. They informed us that the delivery man has arrived and he's coming upstairs. We waited another 40 minutes after that and then he came. we checked the food, it was barely warm and hardened. We told him to take it back and that we don't want it. This entire time, my eldest sister was dealing with them on the phone. I simply watched her. She told me to check if the food was hot and I told her not really. After the guy left, he came back and gave us the phone of customer service and they kept chatting with my sister, offering her to take the food for free or to send another order. She refused both and said she didn't want the food. It's been hours since then and I'm on the verge of a panic attack everytime I remember it. I regret telling her the food wasn't warm and I regret not telling her to just accept the food. I keep imagining how the delivery guy will be scolded and having slight urges to harm myself, as if it would make up for what happened.

i76mst,"My Partner of about 11 months was adopted at around a year old. He had a good upbringing, an only child and his adoptive parents are really great people. Around 19 he met his birth parents. His father hadn't known about him. His parents had a bit of a fling when they were younger and friends. When his mother told his father years later after reconnecting he insisted on meeting my partner.  &#x200B; A bit of history here. My partner has a very expansive sexual history, nothing that he seems ashamed of, bisexuality and lots of sexual partners. He and his ex wife were swingers throughout their marriage and partnership of almost 20 years (They too meet young). He and I met under the pretext of having a casual relationship, and of course that turned into a relationship.  &#x200B; He is easily the best man I've ever met, he is kind, he has an incredible heart, he treats me so very well, respects me and I adore his two children. He was not hard to fall in love with. He has been very open about his past and I feel very comfortable being honest with him.  &#x200B; Saturday we were at my house drinking a bit, he keeps insinuating there are things if I knew I'd leave him. I keep insisting this is not the case just tell me so I can stop imagining the worst. Well. Yeah He told me. When he had met his birth parents he continued to be in contact with them. I did not ask for details.. but he told me he and his mother had a physical relationship soon after. She was 38 he was 20. I couldn't ask more. I'm destroyed. It's not my issue, it's not my problem but now this is my burden to bear and I cannot tell anyone in my life. My best friend is a therapist, I of course wanted to go to her with this but I can't betray his trust in telling me this and I cannot burden her with this. He explained to me there is a psychological phenomena and that this is not uncommon among people who are reunited with their blood relatives. I cannot wrap my head around it. I don't know if I can be intimate with him again knowing this.. and that ""intimacy"" is really important to me in a relationship. I called a therapy group in the city I live in and await a call back. I need help unpacking this and I've asked that he speak to someone about this.

i9rbbm,"Over several months, my therapist had been working on confidence with me, and getting rid of the “toxic confidence” because yes, being over confident can be dangerous to yourself, and others. She started out with, “tell yourself you’re better than somebody. Any name, doesn’t matter.” Several months ago I had said that I didn’t need to tell myself I was, because I knew it. Very toxic mindset. Today, she asked me the same question. She asked me how it felt to say I was better, and today I replied with “toxic, demeaning, and an unfair comparison.” Months ago, I told her it felt empowering, freeing, like I struck fear and commanded attention, that nobody could cross me with this mindset.  She nodded in agreement to my admittance that it was a toxic way of being. She then asked me to pick out a quality in myself that I thought appeared more attractive than on a person I could picture and name. Months ago, I could. I did. I said my rosie pink cheeks, with perfectly speckled freckles, my long hair, thin hourglass body, and my perfectly straight teeth and tan skin look better on me than (insert anonymous name, for privacy reasons) Today? I couldn’t.  She asked me why I couldn’t pick out a person I was in competition with, or something so obvious as my eyebrows, my makeup, my winged eyeliner, my body, my long hair and straight teeth, and I said the same thing as I did with the first question. It is toxic, it is demeaning, and it’s an unfair comparison because there should not be a comparison or competition. This is when it finally clicked. She broke the mindset of I’m perfect, you’re a peasant. We are all flawed. I have gained a few pounds, I now have braces, and I do not feel like it is fair now, or never at all to say that I am or was better than another. I had to learn the painful way that it isn’t until we lose control over our “perfect appearance” that we feel shame in ourselves for what we look like to others. After years of self deprecating insults toward myself, toward others mentally, constantly comparing myself to other people and wanting to look like, sound like, and dress like other men and women or wanting them to look at me like I was a god they couldn’t match, she finally released the training harness on me and let me roam freely with my mind, with questions that she knew I couldn’t answer kindly 6 months ago. I cannot lie and say that I often times did feel as though I was better than a lot of people, by my vocal talent, my writing, my drawing, the way I dressed, and how perfectly I did my eyebrows and hair every morning. I’d often times let my false perception of perfection get to my head, without thinking of the damage it could be doing to others and how I treat them when I tell myself that I am superior. I am not, I have never been.  She finished our session with this homework.  When you feel “toxic confidence” returning, tell yourself in private to say something about you that makes another person look inferior, and imagine that person knowing how you feel and picture them devastated by it. Now swap roles and picture you in their shoes. Realize how damaging your attitude may be. Alter it.   Then proceeded to end with this quote: Toxic is “I’m better than them.”  Confidence is “I’m great, and so are they.” It sounds prettier, because it IS prettier to uplift and empower those around you to feel as good about themselves, as you do inside when you think you’re “better.” You’re not better, simply alike in greatness with others.","wow, thanks for sharing I loved this and have it saved for my notes.",26
ial1nj,"I just had a panic attack, usually a panic attack for me leads into about a week or two of depression. I’ve always just give into the panic and never really fully realize it as a panic attack because the panic always seems like a valid response to my thoughts or environment at the time. But just now something triggered me and I was starting to panic and it some how clicked “I’m having a panic attack” so I just laid down and took deep breaths and kept telling myself that it’s just a panic  attack, and reminding myself all the reasons why panicking isn’t a valid response to my thoughts or environment. I know it’s not always going to be that easy but I’m happy that I was able to escape an episode of depression.  today I’m a little bit stronger!",I’m a therapist and this kind of news is thrilling!

ibbaki,"Learning to restrain your “jealousy” and control your negative feelings will serve you kindly in the future when you’re doing something new, and somebody is verbally jealous of or upset with you, because they were not directly involved/included. You will handle it with poise and be proud of yourself for understanding and respecting this concept, and not allowing others negativity to disturb your energy or mental health progress.","Sometimes I’ll jokingly say something like that to people in my friend group, like “You did the thing without MEEEEEE”, or “I can’t believe you guys have _other_ friends D;”, or stupid stuff like that where I’m very obviously kidding. But the idea of being legitimately upset about something like that is just such a foreign idea to me. Actually, jealousy in general is weird to me, at least in a relationship context. I can’t really conceptualize how a well-minded person could possibly get upset about about a friend or a partner just... _doing_ things. I mean, they had a life before you came along, and unless it’s like, actually harmful ( or I guess literally them just straight-up actually, non-ambiguously cheating ) or something, they shouldn’t put it on hold because your monkey brain is feeling territorial.",6
iblwf7,"A lot of people who could really use it can't afford it. I'm talking about appointments with licensed professionals. $100 on average per session is crazy when you have to worry about other expenses. Sure insurance might cover it for some people, but for a lot of people it won't or they don't have insurance. All my friends who go to therapy come from families that have money. It not fair and doesn't really feel like it should be that way.","I completely agree with what you’ve expressed, therapy is something everyone should have access to but it sadly isn’t the case. I’m assuming you live in the US. Some years ago I was able to find a therapist on [psychologytoday](https://www.psychologytoday.com/) who operated on a ‘sliding scale’ (and they mentioned this in their profile), this meaning they would lower their rates for people who couldn’t afford it. I think I was paying around 40-50$ for hour sessions. I didn’t have insurance either.  There are therapists out there who will adjust their rates to be more accessible. It’s worth looking around for them when in a tight spot and needing some help!",34
ibyzn0,"The more sessions go by, the more I start to reveal my selfish and shallow desires. I think if the average person heard how I feel, they would dislike me as a person. I know it shouldn’t matter what my therapist thinks of me as a person, but I wonder if he is starting to dislike me. Edit: Lots of insightful comments here. I really appreciate it!","I thought the same thing with my therapist. While having a session with them, I blurted out ""You think I'm a bad person don't you?"" They assured me that they didn't and that those thoughts, were my fear and low self esteem talking.  That my actions in the past, don't define how we were interacting now.   What really brought me out of that worry, that they didn't like me, was they told me about all the positives they saw in me, and they were here to be my support as I worked on myself. It's hard to see the positives, when all were focused on is the negatives.  Since that day, I think they've been my therapist for 3 years now. If they are a new therapist, give it a few sessions.  Sometimes you really have to get it all out there.",43
icmkc8,"Joined talkspace about 3 + months ago only because my job was offering a discount benefit and I was in the process of losing my job and insurance and need to use my FSA before it was taken away. I needed to talk to someone during the transitional period and basically poured my heart out to this person — sharing my unresolved emotional issues related to feeling worthless and alone. In response I’d received really shallow responses and vague platitudes and statements like “I’m glad your comfortable sharing that with me tell me more” or “Your’re doing a great job, I see real opportunity here”. ....Wait what??1? These are the type of replies I’d receive to ‘help’ me once or twice a day, so like every 12 hours. How the F*ck does this help someone? The only time the Social Worker seemed to be engaged was over Video chat and only when we talked about my job performance over Video chat. He kept pushing me to be optimistic when in reality my situation wasn’t optimistic at all —- and I gave him hard evidence to the contrary to make it simple for this man to understand I was in trouble at work. Either (1) he wan’t listening, (2) wasn’t equipped to help me, or (3) he was trained to say optimistic things to all patients in hopes their reality would magically change (which is silly fantastical thinking). In the end, the best thing about him was he was somewhat responsive (low bar of expectation, I know). So I decide to quit Talkspace, however I still have FSA money left over and Talkspace offers be $150 to stay — and an additional week, and additional complementary Video chat time....so I take it (giving them one last try) The day I lost my job I switched to a psychologist- this person didn’t respond for over 2 days, so I switched to another psychologist and specifically stated - “I had not had the best time working with help here on Talkspace, please tell me what’s the best way to work with you so I can properly set my expectations and have better outcomes”. This was on a Friday morning, he doesn’t respond for over 24 hours. Suddenly it’s Saturday, so I don’t expect a response til Monday, but to my surprise this guy reply’s to me over the weekend with a long message introduction encouraging me to think it will be better this time around. I reply on Monday, he replies on Tuesday with an audio message, I replay back on Thursday with an audio message....then it’s dead silent for 1 1/2 weeks - he relies back saying “I’m sorry I didn’t reply there was a storm and we were out of power, but boy am I glad to be back!” ...Wait what???...how am I supposed to respond to this....he didn’t even acknowledge my last message. I haven’t replied back in a week to see if he would acknowledge my last message and as of now it’s been another 1.5 weeks without him engaging. IM DONE. F*CK Talkspace - it’s unaccountable unmoderated overly expensive garbage. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY with Talkspace. You will not get the help you need.  You’d be better of calling a SUICIDE HOTLINE for FREE (even if your not suicidal) and get better help than trusting this ‘TECH COMPANY’. My next step is to work on some self-directed activities like reading book, completing some journaling exercises, and meditation.....but, eventually I will need to talk to someone. Moral of story, ‘Tech’ is not a suitable replacement for traditional in-person interaction, especially when we are vulnerable and need expert mental health assistance. UPDATE: Wow. I didn’t expect this post to get as many upvotes as it did —- I just woke up yesterday morning needed an outlet to vent. I hope others can use my experience with Talkspace as a reference and proceed with caution.  Also, a poster below brought to my attention a recent NYTimes article deep diving into the business at Talkspace...what I read did not surprise me the least. Summary: they appear to be capitalizing off of people’s fears — using coronavirus, Trump to push up their subscriber base, they don’t use AI but they are looking into using AI, they give preference to their large customer accounts e.g. Google employees get higher priority and better response rates form therapists and additional resources like outsourced therapists, they mine transcripts to improve their marketing strategy, therapists’ pay is incentivized on ‘engagement’ — therapists get paid more by either increasing respones or simply typing more words in a given response...so I’m pretty sure the longer these therapists drag on an interaction throughout time without addressing your problem directly the more they get paid in the long term. SMH. Like with all these VC funded businesses — the the participates are incentivized all wrong —- this doesn’t help people.","I had a similar experience with Talkspace. I was supposedly working with a marriage family therapist, yet all she ever responded with were vague platitudes and sympathies, occasionally mirroring back a few sentences of my previous post.  There were all these steps about setting goals in therapy configured into the platform, but after using the platform for almost a year, we never once progressed to the point of using them. I seriously suspect that there is an AI involved tbh. Realizing that I could have the same experience for free, I downloaded all my notes into a google doc and just kept it as a journaling exercise.",29

idfq4b,"I had dabbled with seeking help for a few years now, but nothing consistent. This year, just a month ago, I was going through something absolutely devastating and earth shattering, and the lack of social support due to the pandemic has made it really hard for me to find my bearings again and get the energy I needed to recover. I severely needed help, and I was panic-dialing so many therapists to look for appointments. I got one for the week immediately following the disaster, but I didn’t really feel so strongly about this guy. I also got another one, but he didn’t have anything available until about a month out. So I booked both, and I have been seeing doctor #1 for 3 weeks now. It wasn’t horrible but it didn’t feel particularly insightful at times, but I figured it would take some patience.  Today I had a call with doctor #2 and he blew my mind in the short talk we had. THIS IS HOW IT’S SUPPOSED TO FEEL (at least in my mind). I felt so strongly about the points he made and everything resonated so well with what was in my mind. He almost didn’t even really react to what I said about the immediate problems, but instantly found the root of why I got myself into this situation and also what it is that I want to and should address in that way. He. Blew. My. Mind. Anyway, I loved talking to him — even about the painful stuff, and I can not wait until next week to talk some more, however, I am wondering how can I put a little stopped on wanting to just word vomit everything and address it all at once? He’s so good I just want him to know everything and look at all my patterns with me! Any pointers?  TLDR; New therapist is phenomenal, I want him to work on all my problems with me all at once because he’s so good; how do I find some patience here, especially because it’s hard to get super regular appointments with him?","I'm so happy for you that you found the right therapist for you ! Amazing! I think it is completely appropriate to say ""i gave several issues to address and I don't know where to start ."" It sounds like he understands you well and is open to working at your pace, I'm sure he will be open to organizing your time together.  You could also probably ask to schedule sessions ahead of time.",44
idxj49,Can you still go therapy for minor problems? I feel like I can handle it on my own but some days I can't. What are the signs that you need therapy? Is it okay if your problems aren't bad enough?,"Therapist here. Maybe the most popular misconception of therapy, i.e., *counseling*, is that it is an emergency measure, a means of last resort. The truth it, we are counselors first and foremost, and our job is to help you, the client, navigate whatever difficulty you are experiencing in your life. Maybe you had a fight with you SO and want to better understand why it seems like such a big deal to them, or your boss said something to you that really stopped you in your tracks and you want to know why.  Therapy doesn't need to be reserved only for life's biggest disasters. In fact, it's better for you if it isn't. That would be like only going to the mechanic shop when your transmission goes out or only going to the doctor when you find a lump or are coughing up blood. Don't misunderstand me. If you are on the verge of suicide, we're here for that, and if you're thinking of divorcing your partner, we're here for that too. But we are consultants for whatever life throws at you. If you're stuck with something difficult, we can help.",96

ieunee,I have been pushing it off for a year but I did it. They don’t always have enough room bc of limited resources but I should hopefully get an appointment set up. I am only limited to 6 appointments a semester but it’s free. I’ve never seen a therapist before and I can’t afford one even with insurance covering most of it.   Only problem is it’s online and I have no privacy but since my sister will be at school I should have the room to myself.,"That's awesome!! I have four free sessions a semester and was convinced to go for it and I actually acknowledged that I have depression and have been getting lots of good coping mechanisms.  A little unsolicited advice, but make sure you like your therapist and can connect with them, otherwise please get a different one!!! My first one was an older woman who chalked all my problems up to my youth, and the one I have now is amazing– I feel so heard and I've learnt so much from the way she frames my thoughts and feelings.  Also, ask about a sliding scale! Your college might be subsidising counselling sessions as a whole; after my free sessions, my therapist worked out a $10 fee for an hour's session until I can add to it.  Good luck and have fun!",8

My reasons for going to therapy seem small compared to other peoples, its mainly about my relationship with my mum, my jealousy issues and a few other things like that.

ifzyxc,"Recently my MIL has brought up the issue that I'm quite selfish and that brought me to realise that I'm not very good at being considerate towards other people in the sense that I only really know how to take care of myself and let others be unless they ask for help, whereas my SO's family is quite family oriented in the sense that they all try to help eachother in all walks of life. Growing up I didn't really have that family dynamic, so it's a lot harder to adjust to that. My parents were the type of people that would say ""figure it out yourself"" if I ever came across a problem, so it's what I got used to. I have gotten past that and have tried to help when people have come to me for it, but I have trouble with helping ""just because"" because I don't know, I don't really see an issue till it's brought up, or I don't really see their struggle unless they ask. So in the end, to me, I worry about myself really and think that everyone's holding their own well without my interference, and looking back at it, I can see how that can be selfish, but to me I always thought I was trying to be independent and I was sure that if someone needed me they'd ask. But, I guess in this family, it's much more familiar to go out of your way for someone instead. Idk, does this sound irrational? I can't quite figure it out.",Makes perfect sense to me,17
igbbf7,"I lied to my therapist and told her that I don’t speak to my abuser. When I was 3-4 years old I was sexually abused by my older cousin who was a teenager at the time. It was very difficult for to even tell my Therapist this so I sent to her in an email. When we spoke about it in person, she asked me how often do I see this cousin and what do I do when he comes around. I told her that I don’t see him often (which is true) and when I do see him I don’t be around him.... like I would not acknowledge him and leave the room when he’s around. That was a lie. I’m not saying that we’re close or anything because we’re not at all. It’s just that I do give him hug and crack jokes and stuff with him. I’m embarrassed that I do tho and I didn’t want my Therapist to think I’m stupid for still communicating with him. I’m planning on telling my Therapist the truth the next time I see her but I’m scared about what she will think of me.","Trust me they’re not thinking about judging you at all. I think honestly therapists expect a little bit of dishonesty and try their best to get your most honest self. My psych explained to me that sometimes her clients could be dishonest so I’m under the impression they definitely understand it’s difficult. They’re just there to help you. What I do sometimes is say “I know this sounds irrational..” and preface what I say. In your example you can say “I know you asked me last time about X and I said Y, but the truth is Z. I just felt a little ashamed that I still do this”",98
ih1gpp,The therapists barely reply and I didn't feel heard at all. The conversations were way too asynchronous and I was ignored! Customer service doesn't exist. Talkspace scammed me out of $160 for a month. Don't get involved with the massive capitalistic scam that doesn't give a flying fuck about your mental health and is only here to profit off of your problems!! Companies like these make me lose faith in humanity!,I think someone posted something similar a few days ago.

I surprisingly really liked going, and I was happy with my therapist. Did two sessions. Before the third appointment, I got an email from the office saying he’d been arrested.  Sheriff’s office website says it was multiple counts of child pornography. Disgusting. Guess I have to find a new guy but not really looking forward to going through that whole process again.

The idea is not to distract yourself. The idea is to observe your inner processes without judgement. Mindfulness is a practice that can help you recognize the patterns in your behavior and thought processes, and with this you can gain more control and awareness over yourself. That's why brain imaging shows that the prefrontal cortex—the region in your brain that deals with executive functioning—is way more active in people who meditate.

iigaan,"So, my psychologist said she was considering leaving me. I have BPD so I got obviously devastated by that new info, and now, to make things worse, I feel like my therapist is pointing flaws in me all the time and just ""crushing"" me with all her criticism. She knows about all my struggles of abandonment and my hard time on dealing with criticism, so I don't understand what's she's trying to do when making it even worse by becoming more critical and unsympathetic, even after she said that she was considering leaving.. and not only that, I feel like she is venting all the frustration accumulated she had against me for the year and a half that I was with her. How am I supposed to react? She is the only therapist at service right now in my college, and I can't afford a private one. What am I supposed to do? I appreciate any support. Thank you in advance. edit: Also, another thing that bothers me is that she is being much less dedicated while still giving her other patients the same attention.. she told me that no other patient was as complicated as me and that she didn't know what to do.

I hear them but don't really engage with them much, even when they aren't being critical. I've just turned that part of me off, if that makes sense.  However, I still thrive on approval from others, especially about my looks. I'm also extremely sensitive and hyper aware of people's feelings around me.  I was just thinking about how my experiences with disproving parents may have shaped the person I am /things I do today. Anyone else have similar experiences or insights?","Sounds very familiar! I am listening to the book series ‘the highly sensitive person’. Part of the hyper awareness is from having an over active nervous system. Part of it is from the environment you (and I) grew up in.  My sister was always the pretty one. Brown eyes were so pretty, mine were green. If spend an hour doing my hair, they would hardly say a word when I’d ask for their input on how it looked. I was chubby. I was rebellious in the clothes I wore. I don’t get comments anymore, but the damage was done a long time ago.  As an adult, I try to just be ok with me.

This is the first experience I’ve had where the therapist either A. had crazy countertransference B. Is really disengaged and needs a break or C. Needs to complete some extra CEs.  It made me have so much empathy for people who don’t know what to expect from their therapist. I know how therapy goes and I believe I’m fairly self-aware and can explain my thoughts in detail... sooo I know it wasn’t a miscommunication but I could see how someone who was nervous would internalize this woman’s behavior as their failing. Girl please. I about gave a lecture to this woman instead of discontinuing therapy with her and still may... my point being..If you have a therapist that acts uninterested, is asking you the same questions that you’ve answered or you walk out feeling stupid or incapable than PLEASE, go to a different therapist. That is not how therapy should feel. There are times you will be triggered which may result in projection and feeling stupid but your therapist should discuss your triggers with empathy; not shame your response. Man. First time with a bad one and it made me so furious for people who don’t know what therapy should be. So, from a therapist if you haven’t heard it from yours, “ You are so beautifully complex and it’s our job to help you uncover how you can deal with the bullshit and empower you to believe that you are more than capable of living your truest life, whatever form that takes.”","This is the very reason a person-centered approach (and its now-many derivatives) has become so popular in this day and age. When you get rid of the blame and judgement, you remove the platform from which a therapist can take on the role of authority figure. And truth be told, anyone in the industry can tell you that many therapists never finish the core their own ""work"" before they begin advising others on how to handle mental health issues. As a result, these same people don't make very stable therapists. And this is where so many problems start.",15

It sounds like at least some people in the family are using you as the “family scapegoat.” You are under ZERO obligation to save your parents marriage, and that’s not something you can do.

io520q,"Hello all, I've struggled a lot with emotional dysregulation and getting frustrated easily (then being overwhelmed) and unfortunately my therapists until now were not able to give me practical strategies to help me with it. A big part of therapy is having somebody to listen to and that is crucial and helpful, but another part of therapy is also learning the tools to get by on your own. Workbooks are great for that. You read about the issues and it's causes and can directly work and apply the strategies explained to your individual situation.  If anyone struggles with similar issues of emotional dysregulation and poor coping strategies, I can recommend the DBT skills workbook by Matthew McKay and others (it has a green cover). You can also just google for other Workbooks by adding your relevant topic like ""trauma workbook"" etc. I sincerely hope this  helps someone here that might not be able to go to therapy, whose therapist is on vacation or whose therapist can't help with specific issues.","This is a really solid recommendation, thanks!",16
iogbuz,"I started TalkSpace on 8/24. I got the usual cut & paste welcome and “what do you want to get out of therapy?” in the first few messages. I wrote long messages about my past, anxieties, what I hope to accomplish. I got a message (paraphrasing here), “Thank you for explaining what is causing your anxiety. I understand where you’re coming from.” There was no further prompt, question or anything after this. I checked the app daily to see if she’d written. Nothing. So NINE DAYS LATER, I prefaced a new message with, “The app is prompting me to write something! Let’s see...” (I totally phrased it this way out of lack of self-confidence and social anxiety) and I wrote about a recent trauma and fear and asked for thoughts, advice. FIVE DAYS LATER, this is what I get (and remember, the app tells you when to expect a reply, usually it is that same night by 9pm): “Just because the app is prompting you to write some thing it doesn’t mean you need to. This is a place for you to write what you want when you want and express how you’re feeling. That is how I like to approach therapy. Because if someone is forced to write something when they don’t want to then what are they really getting out of this.” Rude? Am I reading too much into this? She didn’t even acknowledge the paragraph I wrote! (Also, she had never written or discussed how her process works or what she’d like from me.)","Hiya! I'm a therapist, and I've used an app LIKE TalkSpace, but \*not\* TalkSpace, and my advice to you is: just don't. The apps are just not set up to facilitate really good therapy, in my opinion. They pay therapists pennies, so anyone that is using it either has a bajillion clients they're trying to keep up with, or they are using it to supplement their other work/practice, so I have heard from a lot of users that they have had disconnected, distant-seeming interactions with therapists on the apps, which is so unfortunate. It's an excellent idea, in theory, but I actually feel like they ended up a little like a scam. The state I was practicing in with this app ran out of counselors at one point, so even though I had turned off my availability because I was full, they still funneled a lot of people to me, and HAD NOT mentioned to their subscribers that they didn't have available counselors... just took their money and then let me break the news to them and walk them through how to deal with it! It's just not my opinion that these apps are set up to provide you with quality counseling, long term. I got out of there lickity-split, and I know a lot of other counselors who did as well. We were making around $28 a session. I just can't work like that and provide quality services, and I don't know anyone who can, really. OK RANT OVER, on to the advice portion of the program:   1 if you have health insurance, check and see what they cover for tele-health. You can even do this online, if social anxiety creates obstacles! BCBS is even waiving all client financial responsibility for tele-health right now for a lot of plans, due to COVID.    2 go to [www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com) you can look for a counselor and see what tele-medicine options they have available- most people updated their psych today profiles with COVID -relevant info. You can use the filters to search through your insurance, if people are accepting sliding-scale fees (if you don't have insurance or can't use it), etc etc. If you find someone who takes your insurance, you can even e-mail them to ask about your out-of-pocket expenses with them, I often call and confirm insurance coverage for each of my people because that sh\*t is dicey, man.    3. You can see a counselor anywhere in your state if you're using tele-health anyway. And a TON of counselors went tele-health due to COVID, and temporary licenses were granted in some states so that counselors could provide remote services.    4. If you really want to stick with TalkSpace, I would suggest asking this counselor outright how this app works for them (everyone has free reign to do what they want, and are basically not checked on AT ALL, yikes), and ask if you need to schedule sessions or anything like that. Ask them to give you a rundown, I might say ""how can I get the most out of working with you?"" And also, if you don't like this one... switch! Bye, Felicia. Research actually supports that your success in counseling is way less dependent on the theory or interventions used, and far more on your connection with your counselor. Find a good vibe that you like, it's so important. Good luck, and WAY TO GO for looking for a therapist, therapy for everyone!!! <3",68
iq5hd6,"   This may be of interest to anyone who has had or is having cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). We are a small group of clinicians and software developers from England, UK, who have spent the last year trying to reduce the drop off rate for people undergoing 6 week programmes of CBT. We experimented with many different resources to support people undergoing CBT for common issues. We experimented with the usual books, worksheets and apps. Unsurprisingly, different things worked for different people and there was no one size fits all resource or method. This led us to build our own resource to reduce the drop off rates we were seeing.  Over the course of a year we incrementally built an app for this use case and tested it with over 100 people. We designed it to be used in between therapy sessions to reinforce lessons and help people complete their goals and exercises. Each person gets a weekly email report with a summary of their progress, their mood progression and their most common cognitive distortions. They can choose to share this with their therapist if they like.  Two things happened that we are pleased with: 1. Not only were we able to reduce drop off rates for the 6 week programme, but we saw much higher levels of engagement during the main programme sessions.  2. Several of our testers referred their friends to the app, as a way to get introduced to CBT. As a result, we have some early indications that it might be useful as a standalone introductory app, as well as something that can accompany professional therapy.  Right now we’re really interested to get any thoughts or feedback on the app and how we can improve it. We’d be really grateful to hear from some users as well as clinicians if possible.  It's available on iOS and android and you can get it at ionamind dot com. We’re incredibly grateful for any feedback and support.",What app should I be searching for on iOS? I’m new to therapy and just started using betterhelp. Will the app benefit me?,6
iqpdny,I just feel like a mess. I’ve been confused and anxious about my relationship and then we got into an ugly argument last night that made me feel more cynical and unsure. I’m facing big life changes and having to make decisions about where I want to live and work once I finish grad school. I’ve been drinking more than usual. I’ve been gaining weight. I’ve been working out less due to headaches.  I just feel like a mess who’s making so many wrong choices. Update: thank you for all the love. I didn’t know expect this post to get this many upvotes and comments. I was expecting to just vent but you all came through. Thank you so so so much,"You will be OK.

ir5oca,"Hello,  I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for about a month and have had two sessions with him. I strictly see him for medication and nothing else, I have a therapist I see more often for the majority of my issues.  So, during our initial interview he asked me about my diet. I told him I’m vegan. He told me that lack of cholesterol is directly correlated to anxiety and that I should eat eggs. I told him I will not eat eggs because I’m vegan. He claims he used to be vegan “so he gets it”. I straight up told him that’s not happening and had to say it three times in the hour we spoke.  So today, we had our first follow up. He asked again if I decided to incorporate eggs. I said no, I’m not going to. He explained the correlation again. I told him I’m vegan for moral reasons, so even if eating them *did* help with my anxiety, the guilty and anxiety I would feel from eating eggs would just cancel it out. He proceeded to “educate” me about sustainable back yard chickens. Blah blah blah. I explained to him, again, that I’ve been vegan for 3.5 years and I’m aware of sustainable options, but I do not wish to consume them. THEN he had the audacity to ask, “what’s your boyfriend think about that?”. Mind you, my boyfriend is also vegan for moral reasons and my psych knows he’s vegan. I said “he’s also vegan for moral reasons.” And left it at that.  I’m so annoyed that I’m spending money to have this conversation. If he tries to talk to me about it again I’m going to tell him that I’m not interested continuing out sessions if he’s going to continue to bring this topic up.  Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this? Doesn’t have to be vegan specifically... but a professional asking you to compromise your morals like this? And please, no jabs at me for being vegan. Please just respect it and if you can’t, just don’t comment. Thank you","Tell your psychiatrist that if he doesn't stop spouting off about eggs, you'll indeed buy some and fire them at his house. If you are concerned about your cholesterol you'd go to a General Practitioner for a test; not a Psychiatrist.",63

isu9pm,"I’ve been seeing my therapist for about four months now. We just had a session the other day where we were talking about my relationship and how I can be more vulnerable. I said “it’s just hard to put in the extra effort because it’s already hard for me to do regular things like get out of bed, brush my teeth, clean, etc” and she stops and says “I didn’t know you had a hard time with these things”. And sounded confused and in that moment I realized I had only ever talked about my anxiety and relationship with her from the beginning (now other things too after being diagnosed) and I never explained these things. I was kinda taken by surprise at myself that I had never discussed this with her lol.  So here’s your reminder, make sure you’re being open with your therapist and maybe take a second to reflect on your conversations with them. This is definitely something I should have mentioned much much sooner but just didn’t? It’s not like I withheld this on purpose either. So weird. Anyway, I hope everyone is having a great day and you’re finding help within your sessions!",There's a lot to cover in a single hour! It's so easy to forget what you needed or wanted to talk about. Some things are gonna be missed. But it sounds like you had a great aha moment and isn't that the purpose of therapy? :),20

ityp7q,"I’m 24F, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety at a young age before I even knew what it meant; hs and college years were awful for me as I grew up in a religious household and was always told to “pray it away”. It runs deep in my family, my great grandpa committed suicide, my brother is constantly in and out of jail and psych wards and rehab, my dad is a recovering addict, anyways not to be a total downer here haha that was just for some background, a little bit of “my truth” if ya will.  All in all I was used to growing up handling my MI (mental illness) without medication. The meds I used when I had the opportunity once I turned 18, weren’t good for me, I met my current bf at age 20, and my life was really looking up, for once, I stopped taking medication and tried to just handle it on my own for the last 3 years, which was working to an extent.  Then COVID hit, I know yeah yeah COVID does suck for us all, I was a germaphobe before this mess, I also work in a school, where the children are not required to wear masks, so they don’t. I don’t have a car and this school is the only one close to my house. I have a communications degree but never wanted anything to do with it after graduation. Now that COVIDs hit I wonder what remote options there are available for people like me, when working in general is just very hard. Before COVID and even when I was a student getting up and going to class was hard, you should see the lengths i’d go to, the creative emails I had sent professors to miss class, the utter bs I could pull out of thin air, I’m not proud but that’s MI at its finest. Of course it’s now creeping back up into the professional world. I get such bad anxiety with COVID, I originally thought better precautions would be done for the school, but it’s a small private school so they can pretty much do as they please. And a lot of the families are “COVID deniers” to say the least. To add to the mix, I’m an asthmatic, who’s smoked MJ more than I’d like to admit to “self medicate”, out of enjoyment, etc. so, once COVID finds me, who knows what’ll happen. The thought of having to sit in a hospital for god knows how long is not something anyone wants. And for the shitty pay and dealing with middle school students, what’s it worth? Currently I have made up a creative excuse to not be at work until Monday (today being Wednesday). My work bought it, and then the vicious cycle continues, where I make up scenarios in my head, come Monday, will someone confront me and call me out? Am I about to be out of work? Maybe it’s all a blessing in disguise (an attempt at positivity haha). The overthinking and anxiety garbage, can I turn off my brain please? Oh how I wish I could... it’s why sleep is so addicting for people like me, it’s the only way to shut it off for a while.  My bf is very loving and understanding, he’s my rock, and I am his. I know, I know I’ve heard and seen it all before “love yourself before you can love anyone else” see for people with MI, I can love and respect myself, but hate my brain. People can throw cliche sayings all they want but the reality is every single relationship is different, bc people are all so very different and complex, shit goes far deeper than the average saying. It is hard because he doesn’t suffer from MI, but he does everything he can to understand, he sees me for who I am, without the MI. He makes me feel normal, and worthy of love and that’s just the bottom line.  Idk what this post really is, just your average banter? I’m in no search for anything specific, if you made it this far thanks for reading and caring enough to engage it means more than you know. I’ve been on reddit for years and yes even posting anonymously gives me anxiety, I’ve only done it a couple times but I’m ready to give it a try be open online. I love relating with other people, hearing their stories, for myself it really makes me not feel so alone.","Hi! Another 24F riddled with anxiety, OCD and some PTSD for good measure here.  I don't have anything to say to you except I FEEL YOUR STRUGGLE. Every day for me right now just seems like I have too much going on and nothing going on all at once and my sad little brain can't cope with it. I try to take joy in the little things and remind myself once a day of all the things I'm grateful for, but it's fucking tough, ya know?  I hope you find some peace, sending some virtual love your way!",9
iuoul7,"Maybe I am bitter. Maybe it’s the specific people in my life. I decided to finally start therapy recently after many years of contemplating. Many years of rough times mentally. Really rough. Once I told my family and close friends, I got 70-80% terrible reactions. I realized I haven’t let many people in on my real pain, especially in the last few years. I also realized that, because of that, my family thinks I am 100% doing good! Haha. I stopped asking for help because no one seemed to care/ want to help. But anyways.  Some things that were said to me when I mentioned I’m starting therapy:  1. Being more spiritual is the cure to mental health.  2. Take more vitamin B 3. Read self help books 4. Most therapists are terrible 5. They’ll probably misdiagnose you 6. They just want you to get hooked on anti-depressants, big pharma! 7. Take cold showers (??)  8. Your grandma only tried to commit suicide multiple times because it was hell living with your grandpa.  Even if some of these things are true, even though I know they’re just trying to help, I’d have much more appreciated a quick “good for you, I hope it goes well.” Instead of each person trying to dive so deep into what my “problem” is and trying to help me fix it. That’s why I am going to a therapist, because I have tried many things on my own and am still having issues that I think a professional should be helping me with, that’s all! I am doing this preemptively in a way because I have been in darker places in my life, and feel this is a good idea to get on top of my mental health before it’s too late.  Needless to say, I feel much more stigmatized since letting the people closest to me in my life know what I’m doing and no longer want to reach out to any of them about anything like that. I let them all know this, that I am not seeking mental health advice from them, just support, but they’re boundary pushers. Oh well. Thanks for reading.",I feel this too. It honestly seems to me like even within the community of mental health professionals there is stigma around going to/being in therapy. I’ve realized there are some things it is better to keep private.,33
iw24j3," Most people I talk to who have serious struggles with mental health, abuse, trauma etc. say they try hard to hide their problems and appear to have the perfect life, that they actively dislike sympathy, pity, attention etc. Some people have even gone so far as to suggest that people with trauma and serious mental illness typically don’t want anyone to know about their issues or treat them differently so they hide it from everyone, while people who are just immature and attention-seeking “get off” on receiving sympathy and pity and are more likely to open up about things, overshare, etc. There is probably some truth to that and it makes me feel so bad about myself because I fall into the second camp. I can become addicted to pity and seeking out sympathy and feel a really strong desire to express my pain and be “seen.” I am very aware and worried about how I come across to others, and very disgusted by this tendency, so I try very hard to avoid hide this from people but it’s still there and motivates some of my behavior. I fantasize about people being worried and concerned about me and even occasionally, subtly, try to elicit this response by oversharing. It’s so embarrassing to admit this. It seems very immature and self-absorbed and adolescent.  To be clear, most of the time I want to hide my problems too. It’s only some people that trigger this perverse desire for sympathy and attention in me. Teachers and professors, and also potential romantic partners, tend to trigger some deep craving for sympathy and attention and caretaking. It’s really embarrassing but I definitely have a desire to be seen as a victim or somehow tragic. I fear most of all that people will see me as spoiled and entitled. I feel like I have no worth outside being a victim, and I fear that if I let go of it, I will be forced to face the truth of my own emptiness which is truly terrifying. Absolutely terrifying.  This is really messed up, but it is painful for me to be reminded that “everyone has their own struggles.” I know that is true, I really do, and I remind myself of it all the time. But instead of feeling compassion and connection to humanity I just feel intense shame when I think about other people’s struggles. I try to feel grateful but I just feel like a horrible person for not feeling grateful if that makes sense.  I feel like I’m supposed to be comforted by the fact that my struggles are not uniquely mine but instead I find it intensely painful because it implies (rightly) that I’m overly sensitive, selfish, entitled, and lacking in character and fortitude.  If I acknowledge reality I also have to a knowledge some extremely unsettling things about myself. I guess it also forces me to accept that having intense feelings is just a part of life. And that I need to get over myself s this feels intolerable. This whole process feels intolerable. There is literally blackness at my core how am I expected to look at an accept the evil? And now I’m being dramatic again just to elicit sympathy, though I’m barely conscious of it.  I don’t know if any of this is making sense. I’m crying a lot as I write this. It really bothers me and I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself. I honestly think I might have a personality disorder of some sort but then I wonder if that is just another way of getting off the hook, of trying to find a reason for my suffering so I don’t have to deal with it as directly, or acknowledge it’s mostly my own fault and/or simply something everyone has to deal with.  It’s weird to realize about myself. Most people say I’m a really good person. My friend once told me I was the embodiment of egolessness. How ironic! My ego and ego defenses dominate my life and nearly everything I do. I don’t know how I can be so self-absorbed and yet still come across as good? I think people are confusing good with timid and fearful of making a mistake or seeming like a bad person (but it’s really all about me, not motivated by altruism).","Therapist here. If I had to guess, I would say that as a child you probably had a very hot and cold relationship with your parents. Maybe one was a helicopter parent while the other was distant, or else both had a tendency to be very loving and supportive at times and very cold and distant at others. As a result, you grew up thinking that was what love looked like - that you have to work very hard just to keep it, that the ""conditions"" for receiving love are always changing, and that you always have to be on guard for fear that those from whom you want to receive love and affection may decide that you are no longer ""worth it"" and abandon you.  I bet, as well, that you are emotionally very reactive, maybe even volatile. You experience your emotions very intensely to the point that you might say that whatever you are feeling in a given moment is your reality. In other words, you get swept up in your emotions, for better and for worse (usually for worse) before you have time to think about what it is, exactly, that you are thinking or feeling.  The result of both of these is that you put your relationships on a pedestal, and are willing to completely subvert your own needs in order to ""protect"" the relationship, i.e., to keep the other person from abandoning you. This can look a lot of different ways, but most regularly you will keep your anger, frustration, or disappointment with the other person bottled up. You don't want them to know you're upset, because *you think that they think* that you're not worth all the drama. You will regularly assume responsibility for mistakes and misunderstandings and perform Olympic gold level mental gymnastics in order to keep them from knowing how you truly feel. You are so preoccupied with the fear of abandonment that you pour all of your emotional energy into the relationship. This doesn't work out how you want, but you're not sure why. You overthink everything you say or do towards them, and you worry how everything is received by them. When these thoughts get too overwhelming you need reassurance that the relationship is not over, so you reach out. When they don't immediately respond, you ""confirm"" your fears - they're mad at you. So, in response, you try even harder to get them to respond, because any response will mean that they are not ignoring you, which means that everything must be ok. \---------- Does any of the above apply to you?",66

iwxcky,"A bit context... Obviously this devastated me but I also think I’ve felt quite guilty as I knew he had problems and was a coke addict pretty much, and I visited him to try go talk to him and help, however, when I arrived at his he seemed so happy and content that it distracted me and we ended partying the weekend, then 2 days later he hung himself.

ixtggy,"Sorry if this ends up kinda long, I'll try to keep it short. I've posted before that I use BetterHelp and was considering switching therapists. Well my therapist just made that decision for me. I've been messaging her about some major anxieties I've been having, and all her responses have been short and not at all helpful. I finally said that I felt she wasn't being helpful, and that if she wanted we could focus on some other issues I want to address. To which she simply responded ""I agree. I can't help you anymore"" She has not responded since. I was so nervous about getting therapy and now it honestly feels like I'm back to square one. I don't even know if I want to continue with a new therapist.  Has anyone else been dumped by their therapist?","I’ve frankly heard similarly terrible stories about BetterHelp — the therapists can be very hit-or-miss.  Therapists are not all like this.

I told him I use my queer identity to find community and support, and to help find language for my experiences.   He said “You want me to be honest with you. I honestly don’t get these labels. I’m just me. I don’t focus on labels.”   I then said “Can I be honest with you?” He said yes. I said something along the lines of “You may want to talk to a queer colleague and do some research. Labels are really important for many people. Otherwise, we’d be alone in our experiences and we wouldn’t know what’s normal and not normal. I like my labels. You have the privilege as a cisgender and heterosexual man of not thinking about these labels. I don’t,” (he previously said he’s cishet, I wasn’t just assuming.) I was really scared saying this, I normally don’t stick up for myself.   He said that makes sense. He asked me to pull together some resources for him on labels and LGBTQ identity, which I’m working on right now.   But hey! I stuck up for myself and advocated for my thoughts, wants, and needs! I felt comfortable enough with this therapist to be able to vocalize my experiences! I used to not be able to do that!   Progress!","That's great! Good progress for you in standing up for yourself. I think it's really important to note though that teaching your therapist is not your job. He needs to take responsibility for his own knowledge gaps.  While this may be a good point of conversation as long as it stays focused on you and how you operate with the labels you identify with and how they're important to you, it shouldn't become you being a representative for a whole identity (ies) and educating your therapist. Just something to be aware of and keep an eye on.",102
iyznsl,"TL;DR: My first loves cousin raped me repeatedly and I’m finally going to tell.  When I was 15(f) I had the most amazing boyfriend in the world. Man, I loved him and he loved me. I know it sounds silly and maybe I’ve built it up to be something it wasn’t. But I always thought he was the one.  One night, my boyfriends 28 year old cousin was supposed to give me a ride home from church. My boyfriend wasn’t there. He kissed me, and I guess I kissed him back. but then sexually assaulted me. I never gave in and he finally said he shouldn’t be doing what he was, and stopped. He told me it was my fault, and I cheated on my boyfriend and id better not tell. I had trusted this guy because we had been talking on messenger for months. I didn’t realize he was grooming me.  I clung to my boyfriend for dear life over that next school year, but when the summer came my boyfriend went away to work for a few months. His cousin had never left me alone; it got much, much worse. I was just a 16 year old kid and he was an adult man.  I didn’t know how to stop him. He gave me all the booze I could drink, since that’s the only way I could bear being with him. And I just let him do whatever he wanted to me. He said he wanted to get married. I told myself that if I went along with it for long enough, eventually it would be okay. It never was.  The shame and guilt ran deep. I couldn’t handle it. I tried to tell my boyfriend when he came back in the fall but I only mustered out his cousin kissed me. I think I was having a mental breakdown. He asked me over and over if anything else happened. Too much shame, too much guilt. It was my fault. I never spoke to my boyfriend again.  The abuse with his cousin went on for a while longer. Finally, some time near the end of grade 11 I decided I’d rather be dead than let it go on. I made sure lots of kids in my high school saw us together, and I finally escaped. It helped my friend started screaming PEDOPHILE!! the next time he cornered me. He left me alone after that. But I drank for 6 straight years to try to deal with it.  16 years after it all ended, I finally thought it might not be my fault. I went to the sexual assault clinic and my amazing therapist said if it would give me closure, to reach out to my ex.  I got his number.  I just text him and said I wanted to apologize, but understood if he never wanted to speak to me again, and wished him well. I really hope he’s happy. I already feel like a huge weight is lifted off my shoulders by telling him I want to apologize. If I never hear back from him, I’ll have to live with it.  I’m sure he’s moved on. But I have been trapped in that day where I tried to tell him for 16 years. I never stopped loving him. I just couldn’t bear to continue what I thought was hurting him. I have had almost no emotion since this happened. But when I think about telling my ex, I either throw up or cry. I think this is what I need to do to finally get better.  Edit: typos","Your an amazingly strong person, just the fact that you reached out is insane. I really hope the rest of your life is filled with nothing but happiness and good vibes",19

j0gbrb,"I have a problem where I can’t talk about my feelings or express my emotions without crying. It’s probably the biggest reason that I don’t like venting to my friends or family; because I just don’t want my voice to start shaking and look like I’m being too sensitive.  For a number of reasons, I’ve finally started seeking professional help for my mental health and my first therapy session (through zoom) is on Tuesday. I. Am. Terrified. My biggest concern is that my therapist will ask me about literally anything and I will immediately start crying and not be able to stop. I guess my question is: how normal is it for someone to be this fragile while in therapy?? I don’t want my tears to get in the way of being able to converse with my therapist and any progress I might be making, but I really can’t control it.  Any advice is welcome and greatly appreciated! :)","It is completely normal to be as fragile as you are in therapy. A good (or frankly, even half decent) therapist won't bat an eye. They see people break down on a daily basis, it's their job to help people work through challenging emotions. Unlike the average person, they don't tend to feel uncomfortable or stressed by seeing someone cry, because they are trained for this. Vulnerability is a natural part of therapy, and there's no reason for you to feel like you have to hold back. I cry in literally every single session, and it has never been an issue.",46
j1f7n9,"I am really ashamed of this, and I hate this about myself, but I know deep down it’s true. I have this kind of childish urge to remain ill, this resistance to recovery. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADHD. More recently, bipolar disorder.  I mean I don’t like being depressed, and if there was a pill that would make me happier, more focused and more motivated I would take it. In fact I do take antidepressants and stimulants, without any reluctance. I love them. I don’t like being tired, boring, lazy and sad.  On the other hand, I am reluctant to help myself. Three main reasons: 1.) Maingl, I’m afraid of the unknown, lazy, rather used to it and unmotivated. I feel unsure of what the future looks like and what I even want it to look like. I feel hopeless about my ability to change very much at all, considering my track record. Most of all, I’m lazy. All have been, I don’t want to work hard on anything. 2.), I’m afraid of accepting responsibility for my flaws without any recourse to mental illness. Im acutely aware of all of my weaknesses, some in my control, some less so, but all possible to improve (for example, social awkwardness, weight, lack of verbal communication skills, laziness, flakiness, impulse to lie, tendency to steal, self absorption, pretentiousness, romanticism, disorganization, overly sensitive, entitled, easily frustrated, tendency to give up, not always a good listener, mental slowness, lack of life experiences, lack of certain life skills, responsibilities, maturity, relationship skills, etc.). I am very ashamed of these. I do feel inadequate and deficient in so many ways. I’m afraid of having to face all of my weakness ness, and for other people to witness those weaknesses, without being able to invoke mental health as an explanation/excuse. I feel like people will reject me, judge me, criticize me more harshly for these traits unless I have some kind of unless I’m a victim of some sort. I feel like it’s not okay to be this flawed without either things that compensate for my flaws, or some kind of tragic circumstances. I’m afraid of the judgement of others and depression, fragility, low self esteem is a surprisingly good shied against that.  3.) this one’s the most shameful but... It makes me feel special and more likeable/loveable. I think I have a victim mentality that I'm addicted to. At the same time I see how unattractive that is, and I know that I am a victim of no one but myself. I try to always blame myself, never blame other people and never complain about my situation, unless I'm complaining about myself, but even that feeds into the victim mentality. I actually think I use self-loathing as a way to mask the fact that I feel like/want to be a victim (and then do actually hate myself for wanting that). Does that make any sense?  Deep down I realize the reason I'm not recovering is because I don't want to. I don't actually believe, or let myself believe, I'm a victim. At least that’s what I tell myself. I try to tell myself that I cause most of my own suffering and I generally do believe that. Yet I still want others to see me as a victim, as bad as that sounds. Even worse, i do not want people to see through this, to see that I *want* to be seen as a victim (even though it's true).  It's a part of myself I really don’t like, and I don't think many others would/do either. I both genuinely dislike myself and also also use it, perpetuate it, as a means to an end. I use my own self-hate as a way to try and avoid or mask any trace of self-pity, but conveniently also elicit compassion in others.  I'm sure others can see through this facade which I am only just now starting to see through as well. This makes me feel like one of the most insufferable kinds of people but it’s also kind of liberating because it’s the kind of awareness I need to finally change after years of the same self destructive behavior. I think I also believed at some level that if I hated myself enough it would somehow make me a good person. That sounds crazy but it’s true, like somehow hyper awareness of my bad side could purge me of it, magically. But now I see through that and have to deal with the fact that I have good reasons to dislike myself. Not quite, but you know what I mean. That I'm not innocent. There is also a part of me that does want to get better. But there is another part of me that doesn't, and right now that part is winning.  I honestly feel too old for this (23), like something an angsty teenager would feel but then grow out of. I really don’t like this part of me, but I feel like I can't help that I want what I want (to stay depressed and timid and get sympathy and attention from others). I know it’s really immature. I find it repulsive that I am like this. I've always felt drawn to darkness and suffering and being a victim even though I genuinely don't think I'm a victim of anyone anymore but myself. I understand why I want to be a victim, but I find it both unacceptable and impossible to stop wanting.","Therapist here, and someone who felt so much of this from my own experience with life.  Hear me: **you need not feel ashamed of this**. I want to revisit this later today when I have had a chance to collect my thoughts and focus my energies, because I have been through this - I am going through this now - and I want to offer you the encouragement that my therapist has offered me.",54
j2pl48,"A little context, my brother (30M) has some emotional issues which stem from or at least are related to substance abuse (mostly weed/alcohol we think, but to a destructive level).  I (33F) finally talked my family into trying group therapy to talk about some ongoing issues which stem from his behavior, particularly because he still lives at home with my parents.  I'm on the periphery as I live out of state but I know how hurtful his behavior is to himself, my parents, and myself when I visit.  I suggested family therapy to try to get us all out of this repeated cycle of disappointment, resentment, frustration, and toxic behaviors. Anyway, during the first session where we were all present, he was playing with his phone a lot and at a couple of points left the room to ""use the bathroom"".  While he was out of the room, the therapist did his best not to discuss him behind his back, and later addressed a few topics that came up while he was away.  Most of the hour-long session was my brother deflecting and avoiding issues and wondering out loud why we were only talking about his behavior and no one else's.  He felt attacked and was clearly on the defense.  I get it.  But he made no attempts to have a conversation, showed absolutely no interest in participating in this session. The next day, my mom revealed to me after my brother revealed to her that he was secretly recording parts of the session and especially when he had left the room.  I feel like this is a real breach of an ""unwritten contract"" of therapy, especially in a group setting.  He made no effort to talk or reflect during our time together, but wanted to record so he could spy on us while he interrupted our session in hopes of what, blackmailing us later?  I really try to be patient with him and understand things from his perspective, but this may be the last straw.  There really isn't much action to take other than to further detach from him, I'm just hurt and angry about it. Am I making too big of a deal about this?","Sounds like he thinks you all hate him, and he's worried about it to the point that he felt the need to record what's being said while he isn't there, so he can find out ""what you really think"". Op, don't listen to people saying to 'cut him out'. I guarantee you the reason behind him doing this is the same reason he has problems with alcohol. Your brother needs serious help, he doesn't need group therapy, he needs intense personal therapy. He doesn't need people 'catching' him doing something wrong or big family hate sessions. He needs you to help him, not get on Reddit and complain about your addict, mentally ill brother.",77

j43h09,"I quoted Winnie the Pooh tonight in my counselling session while talking about the concept of loss, even though I am not there for that reason. The quote was: ""How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard"". My therapist said ""that could be about Piglet, about honey or about...yourself"". I needed a moment for my brain to understand. I, indeed, had said goodbye to myself and all the things that made me who I was last year, after a traumatic incident. She made me realize how lucky I am to have ME, and that I've been suffering not because of other people, but because I said goodbye to who I was, that beautiful, wonderful person and all she was made of. Mind-blowing. Winnie the Pooh is key lads.","Winnie the Pooh is literally phychology for kids.

j4we85,So yeah the title says it all ( am drunk right now). I've never really been happy with my life and have suffered from social anxiety and extreme loneliness. I havent had many friends in my life and I've never had a romantic relationship. I'm just about to graduate from college and my career aspects aren't great. My parents I've recently realized are low-key emotionally abusive and I've probably going to move back in with them. I've gone to therapy before and I've felt that I've never really been able to open up and I've never talked about my suicidal thoughts. I know you guys are going to tell me to see a shrink it's just that I'm afraid if it tell them about the suicidal thoughts they'll put me in a cage or something.

j5czpo,"I am preparing to have a difficult conversation with someone and I'm a very emotional person. Usually my immediate, reflexive response to feeling extreme anger or helplessness (in response to this specific person) is to tear up, and once they notice, my embarrassment provides fuel to continue crying.  The nature of the conversation requires me to convey autonomy and it will be severely detrimental to my case to start crying.   I've read all sorts of tips for preventing it (e.g. breathing exercises, blinking, tilting head back, pinching yourself, etc) but usually they presume that there's a period of time in which you notice yourself about to cry, before you've started. My problem is that it's literally reflexive, by the time I've even registered it, the tears are already rolling.   I'd really appreciate tips from anyone with similar experiences.","You may not have much control over the physiological response to your feelings. Just like sweating or getting red when upset,  most peoole can't control that aspect of their emotional response.   I would concentrate on controlling the intensity of the feelings that precede the response.  If you consider your emotional intensity on a scale from 1-10, at what point do you begin to cry ? If , for example,  you cry at a 6, your task may be to not let your intensity get beyond a 4. When people find their response occurs before they have registered their feelings, it often helps to focus on emotional awareness.  It can take time,  but is completely possible.",28
j5o3ti,"For the past few months life has just seemed empty for me. As if there's no point in anything. I find no joy from anything and I have no motivation to do anything. Life just seems so pointless currently. I'd recently started talking to a girl and things were going great. I started to have motivation to improve myself and try to excel at things such as school because of her. It seemed like we were actually going to have a relationship; things were going so well. Then all of a sudden she just stops talking to me and has lost all interest. I now feel way worse than I was before and this sort of thing happens every time I start to like someone. I try to tell myself it isn't my fault and ""they're just not right for me"" but I'm clearly the one common denominator in all these cases so I can't help but have this feeling of self loathing/hatred.","I feel the same. No interest in a single thing. I haven’t felt that ‘happy’ or ‘content’ feeling in over a year. Not sure I remember truthfully what it feels like. Nothing going wrong in my life.

j63t9n,"first session in therapy went extremely well. i had a big catharsis that led to my coming out to my family, among other big things i never thought would be possible in this life time. everything was ok for the next weeks. i went to therapy weekly. she wanted me to take meds but i said that i'll hold off meds until the school break comes because i'm afraid transitioning to meds during school would be complicated. as many of you know, the process isn't easy. even though i came out and did my confrontations to my mom and sisters and told them everything i needed to say, my emotions were still shit. all it takes is one small trigger to take me back. and lo and behold, that trigger eventually came (too tiresome to type what happened, but it was a small thing but triggered me bigtime nonetheless). so im triggered, had a relapse, and i'm back to having a major depressive episode. last week, i was really conflicted about seeing my therapist (i was at that point wherein, why the fuck should i even try to be better, fuck this shit). but i still managed to somehow convinced myself to go to my appointment. my appointment was at 4pm (we're doing online therapy bc of COVID btw). come 4:10, my therapist still wasnt there. so i texted her and told her where she is. and she replied that she FUCKING FORGOT TO SCHEDULE ME TODAY. I'm like, okay, okay, this is some annoying shit but i can still tolerate it. It was weird bc we always have the same sched (4pm every thursday). but she was a bit old, so i'll give her a bit of a leeway that maybe she just forgot. she told me give her 5 minutes. 5 minutes in she still wasn't there. she texted that we'll start at 430 because she's on the phone with a lawyer (tf does that have to do with me??). 440 pm, she still wasn't there. So i was like fuck this. I had to convince myself to go push through with the therapy sesh despite not wanting to go because i wasn't in the ""i want my life to be better"" mood, at LESS THAN ONE HOUR OF SLEEP (it was finals week, so my sleep was fucked), and this fucking happens. If this had happened on any other occasion i might be okay with it. And the fact that she kept moving the time was just really sketchy, it's as if she's REALLY trying to put off my session with her. Bitch didn't even apologize for forgetting our schedule. When I told her that im cancelling the sesh, she just texted back ""okay, (my name)"". LIKE WOW. NO SORRY? NO APOLOGIZING? Just ""okay, thank you for reaching out but nah, figure your episode on your own"". Like god. Don't even try to defend her in the comments, cuz partly i could understand if she really forgot, but not apologizing for it? Wow. Just wow. I could handle being stood up by people. But by my therapist? Who knows i'm having a depression episode and who knows all my shit? Maaaaaannnn did that really do WONDERS for me wanting to ""get help"". So now, I cancelled my relationship with her, and I'm once again contemplating on just killing myself. Fuck my therapist for being unprofessional, I was even supposed to ask her to give me meds prescriptions on the day she stood me up. But I guess the universe just finds a way to make you not believe in things again.","Therapists are not infallible people (I’m a therapist myself so I get it), but how your therapist handled this wasn’t okay either. There could be many reasons why she forgot and then didn’t apologize, none of which diminish your experience. I would suggest emailing her and letting her know why you’ve canceled your relationship with her and let her know you were disappointed she didn’t apologize. It won’t fix things, it won’t make her apologize, it won’t reestablish your therapeutic relationship, but it’ll let you advocate for yourself and take your agency back in the situation. It sounds like you were feeling so low and then having someone (who’s meant to help you hold those feeling) not show made you feel that much worse. I can imagine it’d make me feel like I really had no one who cared about me. Writing her an email explaining her mistake from your perspective can help you feel like you care for you, and you can advocate and take your agency in your own hands.  But this is just unsolicited advice on the internet from a stranger. It sounds like you’ve got a lot going on with school so relaxing for your break could be helpful too. I hope things start looking up. If you need help or are ever in a crisis, please call a hotline (if you pm me your country I can find you a crisis hotline to call). You’re not alone and things do get better. Edit: grammar",53
j6uy2f,"This is something I thought about my last session that I thought I'd ask you, peeps.Therapists are essentially strangers that come in and look at the junk drawers of people's lives- all the stuff and debris people hide from public view, all the stuff that doesn't really have a place in the home that gets carried around anyway gets shoved into this little drawer. What do you do to keep from ""picking up"" the junk and carrying it around with you? How do you reset for the next patient after having just seen a rough one?    Update: I in no way meant to offend anyone. Just curious. I appreciate the feedback, and this has been very insightful. <3 I hope you all have time to take care of yourselves. Thank you for everything you do. Mental health professionals are some of the front lines for covid-19 and you guys get nowhere near as much credit as you deserve.<3 Have a nice evening","Therapist here. Before answering your question I will add a layer: we have our own personal junk drawers! I had this conversation with my therapist a couple of sessions ago. I asked her how she is doing (we have a unique relationship since we are both therapists, in addition to being so alike already), and she unloaded it on me. It's hard for counselors right now, not only the nature of the job itself, but the added stress of this unusual year, and making matters worse, we're all working from home. Why is does that make it worse? Because now there is no separation between work and home. In a sense, we are inviting our clients troubles into our own safe places.  With that said, to your first question, (I speak only for myself), it is to a degree unavoidable right now. Speaking personally, at the end of the day, I more or less shutdown. I don't do a lot of interacting with friends or family - even if I want to - because I don't have the energy. I typically turn off my computer, and just try to relax - read, workout, play with my dog. I take an herb called kratom to help with anxiety, so I may take a dose and then have a hot bath.  As for resetting between sessions, again just my personal experience, but it usually doesn't happen because there isn't always much time. It's a bit like running or working out in general - you want to get into a rhythm. Resetting between sessions would be like thinking about every step on a 10-mile run. Better, rather, to get into the mindset and let 'er rip. Many counselors I know, myself included, are quite good at compartmentalization. Every session is it's own working day. We carry the adrenaline from previous sessions, but the actual events of the session(s) are locked in their own box. That ties into the answer to your previous question. the compartmentalization comes at the cost of being drained most days. It is less of an issue under normal circumstances, but this year is an outlier. One of the big things counselors model for clients is (or should be) healthy boundaries. That is more important now, on the whole, than it has been in a very long time. Counselors have a great and terrible responsibility - to be strong, steady, and secure for our clients - and right now there are a lot of people whose lives have degraded to an unimaginable degree. We have to take care of ourselves if we are going to be of any benefit at all to anyone else. Right now, we're all in varying degrees of survival mode. Other therapists - agree? disagree?",84
j8g1lp,"Don’t know if this will be helpful, but I’ve been going to therapy for almost 2 yrs now and I thought I would share a few (largely free!) things I have found that have helped me make the most of it...  1. Journaling. I try and make 2-3 entries a week, usually before/after the therapy session, and I will also make an entry if I feel particularly upset/worried by something, or can’t sleep. Think it has helped to clarify thoughts and also see what I’ve been talking about in therapy in action a bit more to solidify what I’m learning and patterns 2. Meditation. I know, I know, everyone bangs on about it and it’s boring. But I find checking in daily really important for grounding, regulating the nervous system, taking a step back to observe feelings, giving self space to feel feelings, etc. Benefits don’t always feel immediately tangible but looking back over the last 6 months I think it has made a difference 3. Exercise. I try to raise heart beat every other day. Easier now gyms are open, but there is always running, weights, and routines using own body weight  4. Walking. I’m v lucky that I live near a park that has some wooded parts. Whenever I feel on the edge, I get out, whatever the weather. Ditto if I wake up ridiculously early. Also good if I cannot being myself to exercise/having a rest day 5. Paying extra attention to self-care. Yeah, it feels really self-indulgent, but also so what? I give myself the chance to have 8 hours sleep, even if I don’t always make it. I try to eat a few fruit and veg everyday. I have a salt bath once a week 6. Talking to friends about how I’m feeling. Not easy at all. In fact, really fucking hard and one of the hardest parts of the whole process (for me). And sometimes people don’t react well at all. But sometimes they really come through for you and when that happens, it’s invaluable. Of trauma happens in relationships, we heal in relationships  Anyone got any others??","My therapist told me to always give myself something to look forward to, even if it’s small.

j95d0z,"I think I may have just found the purpose for my trauma. I ride horses and I'm training to become an instructor. I am young, only soon to be 18, but I had the brightest idea today. Where I live there is a mental health crisis due to lack of services. So imagine this: A horse ranch where people can come and stay for a week or more. They have unlimited, 24 hour access to on site therapists and mental health professionals. They can take part in therapeutic riding lessons/hacks (riding along forest trails, roads, beaches, fields etc) and learn to heal from trauma and pain with the help of horses and nature. In an ideal world this would be government funded, paying therapists and mental health workers a generous salary in order to attract more people to a similar career, which in turn would accommodate the growing mental health crisis in Ireland. Each resident would have their meals provided, as well as access to support groups and other recreational activities that aren't necessarily mental health oriented. I think something like this in Ireland, where mental health services are essentially non-existent, would be amazing. I may only be 17 but I've seen first hand how awful our services are, and I think using my pain and trauma as a driving factor in helping others would make it all worth it.

jb9jmv,"Was out sick today due to PTSD. Got in contact with my trauma therapist, and she filled me in for today. She gave me a doctor's note, but it says ""counseling appointment"" on it and has the name of the YWCA (which does trauma therapy/advocacy in my area). Will this be acceptable? Is there a potential for backlash from my professors? My English professor knows I'm mentally ill (I've written about it in my creative pieces and I reference just a *little* too much Sylvia Plath and Kay Redfield Jamison) but my math professor has no clue. Should I send it or not?","You should look into the disability support your school provides. I did this with my ptsd. You have your therapist provide a form stating your diagnosis. Then work with a disability counselor for accommodations. These include extended amount of absents, longer test times, extended hw deadlines. Whatever you think you may need some extra cushion in. They will write a letter for each teacher stating you are registered with the disability program and list your accommodations. It’s good to have in case of back up and so you don’t have to worry. You just give the letter to each teacher then communicate with them when you need to use an accommodation. Also nice because you don’t have to disclose anything to your teacher. And they can’t argue with the disability program.",62
jccnu4,"Edit: thank you all so much for the support Hey, I’m 13 and my mom died when I was 9. I miss her so fucking much. She died of a heroin overdose and she was a shitty person but I still loved her. We grew up poor, in a dirty house that had rats in the walls. She tried her best to give me, my sister, and my brother a good life. And then my step-dad came in. He was the father of my sister, and he was the most horrible person. When my mom passed he took my sister and I haven’t seen her since. It’s been five years and I haven’t seen my sister. She was a saint, the nicest lil girl you’ve ever met. We would play dolls and play hide and seek and eat candy. I loved my family so much. And now it’s all gone. I live with my dad, he’s alright, but I still miss my siblings and my mom. The worst part? Mom died on my birthday. I didn’t get to spend my birthday with my mother. And I never will again. I just need some support right now..","You have support here! Hang in there. Our moms, no matter what mistakes they make, are always going to be in our heart. And when they leave this Earth, it is one of the worst pains. I’m sorry you haven’t been able to see your sister, I’m sure she misses you just as much. I’m glad living with your father has been okay so far, maybe you can reach out to him and talk about things? Or request to see a therapist to help you with some of this grief? If he is opposed to it, or can’t afford it, you can talk to a counselor at your school about therapy. I think it is really important at this stage in your life to be able to find a way to manage all these things crashing down on you. I know it doesn’t help right now, but time will heal things slowly. Stay strong & stay optimistic.",23
jdg1p7,"He works at one of the few therapy clinics in my area that offers free therapy ( for those who qualify like me) I told him about my much older coworker constantly staring at my body, accidentally touching me, and constantly in my work area instead of his own. One day, my coworker for some reason thought it was ok to grab my ass as he was walking by. He of course did this while no one else was around. He said it was accident and that he was falling. He obviously just needed to grab my ass to keep his dumb face from hitting the ground.  As a someone who experienced csa from age 6 to 18, this deeply bothered me. I went into the bathroom and cried until a customer came through the drive through. None of my other co workers knew and I just tried to concentrate on work.  The next day I had my weekly appointment with my therapist. I told him about what happened and he did agree with me that my coworker sounded predatory especially considering that I’m 19 and he’s 40+. My therapist told me that the best thing I can do is just wear baggier clothes so I don’t tempt him. I already wear baggy clothes to work but I’m pretty curvy so you can still see my body. I told him that I can’t change how my body looks in clothing and he just wouldn’t understand. I’m just really upset about this and don’t even know if I even want to schedule another appointment with him. But that means that I will have to look for another therapist and I don’t know if I can find one who can see me for free or low cost again. EDIT: I put this in a comment but because it adds context to the convo I had with my therapist I decided to add it to the post:  I did tell my therapist at the time that what he was saying bothered me. He told that he used to be a therapist for sex offenders and he know how there minds worked. He said that they look for any sign that you might want the attention which is why he told me that I need to wear baggier clothes to not tempt the coworker. That when I replied saying that I can’t control how my body looks and I already wear baggy clothes to work. The conversation ended there. I never felt like he said it to be malicious, he is a man close to his 60’s so I feel like he just has an old school mindset. Which is why I decided I’m not going to report him but I don’t think he would be a good therapist for me. I experienced sexual abuse for most of my childhood and I don’t think I’d feel comfortable opening up to him about those parts of my life because I don’t want another response like this","No one has mentioned this, but please go to your manager and let them know what happened. That’s sexual harassment and needs to be reported. Totally unacceptable. You should not have to fear for this kind of behavior from your coworkers.",110

I’m expecting a call back, hopefully within the next couple of days. Thank you again to everyone who commented.

jeudtu,"My fiancé works 12 hour shifts for multiple days in a row. During these days he doesnt have much time to text/call/check in because of the long hours, etc. He will still make time to call me after work on his drive home but usually I am already sad and lonely by that time and no fun to talk to. I really want to work on this because my rationale brain knows that he's just busy and NOT ignoring me but the emotional side of me always wins.  Some more details, I've had precious relationships where I was constantly ignored and begged for attention. So now whenever I feel the slightest bit of being ignored I get really sad.  My finacé on non-work days is always very responsive and attentive. It's just the long works days that really bother me.  Any help? It's not him at all. It's me.

jf2mex,"He beat up my family and raped me when I was young. Everyone in my family denies abuse and no one knows about the rape. I went full NC with them all this year. He’s a doctor. I’ve never asked him for a dime in my life. I lost my job this year and haven’t been able to afford regular therapy. I hated my job even while I was in regular sessions.  My therapist would always suggest that I ask my parents for help. She did it again during my last session. Only she was less light about it because I confessed his sexual abuse. But she’s been aware of it this whole time. I feel like she wants her needs met at the expense of my peace. She knows everything that my dad did. He has even left a voicemail on her professional phone, asking her to tell me to “come home.”  She ignored him and played me the voicemail. He had never even heard of her before I started therapy. She doesn’t want me seeing him. But how could she want me talking to him for even a second? She has great judgment otherwise, so this confuses me.","I’m not sure why she would say that, but given what you’ve shared I 100% strongly disagree. I had very similar circumstances as you growing up, & this is also the first year I’ve gone no contact with my dad and his family. Given your circumstances, you run the risk of opening the door to him to come back into your life. And if he’s anything like my dad, he’ll probably try to use the fact that he helped you as leverage to draw you back in / guilt and manipulate you with it.  If there isn’t more to her reasoning as to why she’s recommending you communicate with your father who raped you, I would highly suggest that you find another therapist. I know that money is tight, but I believe that there are some resources that can help you with sliding scales for payment.  I’m so sorry for what you’re going through, but it’s such an incredible step to go no contact. I know how hard it is to do, especially when your abuser is close family.",53
jfjv4w,"I'm doing everything right (therapy, alternative treatments, tried 10+ meds) and I cannot catch a break. Things have been getting progressively worse with my anxiety and depression and it's not sustainable. This is not a life that I can continue to live, but I have no choice. I cannot commit myself doing my job well, I cannot maintain my once-great relationship with my wonderful boyfriend, I can't get myself out of bed most days, and I certainly can't do well in school. This is my first time having a problem that is not fixable. I cannot go to my parents, doctor, cops, anything, to get rid of this problem, and I feel so hopeless. I'm trying to get SOME accommodations with my schooling (private presentations with prof instead of in front of the class, etc.) but I can't see myself graduating.

When i'm in the waiting room I wish she would forget our appointment, when I hear her walking I'm thinking ""I can't do this"", when we settle down in the chairs and have some small talk I could die... and then... the magic happens!  I can release my emotions, my fears. I can be myself. I can get some good insight about myself or my past. I feel I'm with someone who can help me achieve my therapy goals. We work great as a team! And then the 45 mins are up, I get anxious again to have to wait another week to get all these feelings again. To actually feel, instead of the numbness I feel during the week. For now my therapist is the only person who can pierce through my thick wall and I am really greatful that she does. I also know that after some more work, I can open up without her help. I just need to hang in there.  In your case, why are you forced? Most of the time therapy only works when you are open to it. Does your therapist knows that you don't want to be there?

It's a little scary for me, because for a while, I was considering going to art school and being an artist, but now that I don't find any enjoyment in it, I'm conflicted.","I’m so sorry to hear that you’re struggling with this. I’m sending you lots of love ❤️ You’re definitely not alone, and it’s a really crappy feeling :( I would absolutely suggest talking to a professional about it. Unfortunately, it’s very unlikely to fix itself if you don’t figure out the root cause and treat/solve that (because it’s almost certainly being caused by something underlying (not necessarily mental illness)). Luckily a professional can help with that, and will assist you in getting back to finding joy in things! Please trust that this isn’t permanent :) I don’t know what you’re already doing/if you have other symptoms, but here are a few things you could try to incorporate into your life to combat this in the meantime: - Exercise/be active (aim for on a daily basis...it doesn’t have to be super strenuous! Walking or yoga would be great if other things feel too hard rn) - Get out in nature - Regular meditation and/or breathing exercises (tons of great guided ones on youtube) - Connecting socially (even over text/facetime) - Spend time with animals if you can - Journal - Mitigate any stressors in your life that you’re able to (chronic stress can manifest like this) - Practice good sleep hygiene - Listen to music (uplifting vibes preferred but not mandatory ofc) - Adopt mindfulness techniques - Prolonged fake smiles, often! This will trick your brain into releasing those “happy chemicals” - Clean your room/house - Hydraaate A cliché list, I know, but I promise those are clichés for a reason—they can all have a significant beneficial impact :) Also, something that a lot of people miss/undervalue: check your diet!! Balanced macronutrients (i.e. carbs/fats/proteins) are important but especially make sure you’re getting enough micronutrients (i.e. vitamins & minerals), and if you’re not, get some supplements! In particular, look into vitamins D(3) and B12, iron, zinc, magnesium, potassium, iodine, and calcium. Google is your friend; there are a bunch of sites with simple calculators for this stuff. And try to minimize alcohol/drugs and fast food...sucks ik but our bodies vote no bueno when not consumed in moderation Hope this helps somehow! Feel better soon, friend",16
jiia78," I'm on mobile fyi. I made some things vague and changed details because I don't want people to recognize me.  This happened a few weeks ago. I had a phone session with my therapist where I talked about my troubles with dating. I've talked and went on socially distanced dates with many men, who have some problematic views on LGBTQ+ issues. Its been hard for me talking with these people and has taken a toll on my mental health. But I don't want to tolerate those views. I'm also bisexual so its an important issue to me. I've been asking people I talk to a specific question about an LGBTQ+ issue to weed out those people.  My therapist then said I should stop because its their preference. But its also my preference not to tolerate it. We got in an argument and she accused me of wanting to force her to do things she didn't want to do otherwise she'd be sexist, racist, homophobic, etc. I tried to defend myself and make my point more clearer. Obviously I don't want to force anyone to do something they don't want to do. The last straw was was when he said if a man was attracted to me and talked to me, but then found out I was bisexual, he would not be homophobic if he rejected me because I was bi. She said its okay for him to feel that way. I hung up on her after that. I felt like she was telling me I should just accept and tolerate discrimination against me. I told her I'm not seeing her anymore because of the last thing she said and also twisting my words to make it a personal attack on her.  On one hand, I feel guilty that my views have made me lose a important person in my life who I've known for 5+ years. On the other hand, I do feel like she stepped way out of line and her conduct was unprofessional so I have every right to end things. But am I right to do so? Was she out of line?","There is never a wrong reason to fire a therapist. If they don’t work for you - that’s all the reason you need.  Clearly this therapist isn’t the right fit for you - you did the right thing.  Therapy is a very vulnerable, and safe place. To feel the need to protect and defend your vulnerability... sounds like this therapist isn’t creating a safe and non-judgmental environment for you.",53
jiw6e3,"I know this might sound like I'm placing blame on therapists here, but I'm genuinely curious why this is the case and I'm hoping there's an explanation besides ""it's just the market."" Everyone talks about how the mental health care system is broken and that it's notoriously expensive. And yet, part of the reason why it's so expensive is because the therapists themselves only want to take patients with private insurance or who can afford to pay $100 a session. The fact of the matter is, 40% of Americans wouldn't be able to handle a $400 emergency (ABC News). So what gives? This text is mostly based on anecdotal experience, so if I'm wrong about my beliefs, please let me know. I'd love to learn.","Unfortunately, it is the healthcare system as a whole.  I would personally like to see medical professionals be required to have a percentage of their patients be recipients of Medicaid or the like.  It is not just therapists that do that but also medical doctors of all practices. Some therapists do take the state provided insurance and/or see patients on a sliding scale.  I do not necessarily think that says anything about the quality of the therapist.  However, I think the trend is for non PhDs to be more flexible or even newer therapists so they can at least establish a client base. Just with most professions, it is difficult to work for ""free"" and some therapists have chosen to go the route where they refuse to take non-private insurance.   Not many people would work for free so until our mental healthcare system is reformed to be more affordable to all through more affordable health care in general, there will always be this issue.",63

jowq64,"Just broke up with my therapist of two years after they crossed a very serious boundary. I think I handled it very well and am pleased with myself and my ability to maintain assertiveness, but it's time to put it in writing and get some outside perspectives.  This person was my first therapist, so I never really had any other experiences to which to compare our sessions. Insurance paid for them 100%, so I don't feel that I've been cheated out of anything, but I do think I placed a lot of faith and vulnerable trust into this professional, simply based on the fact that they're being paid, so they are obligated to have my best interest in mind. A simple exchange of money for services. This person definitely helped me process a number of things throughout the years, and it felt good to have an unbiased source to go to, to sort things out in a rational way, or reframe situations that I may have distorted personally. Essentially placed all my faith into what this person was telling me, and trusted their judgment due to their credentials and the positive outcomes I experienced after our sessions.  I personally also work in the mental health field, though not at the level where I can practice psychotherapy myself, but the foundations of a therapeutic relationship are very obvious to me due to my work and education. I do think I noticed a number of red flags during my sessions, but I chalked up most of them to this person's airheaded personality - coding sessions wrong, continuing sessions for longer than an hour, or even leaving paperwork laying around from previous clients (I once recognized paperwork for someone I know personally). Either way, they didn't necessarily harm me, and regarding billing, I actually feared I was benefitting from it - like that Monopoly card about a ""Bank error in your favor, collect $50."" So I let it go. Hey, I'm still getting effective treatment right?  This person ended up writing a letter of recommendation to my PCP for a specific prescription medication that would benefit me, and I ended up receiving it, and am still reaping the positive results over a year later. However, this person also told me that they're taking the same script personally. Now I know that I would *never* speak to my clients about my personal prescriptions, even in the context of discussing medications. I've received loads of training through school and on-site trainings specifically explaining why this is unethical. But on the receiving end, my relationship with my therapist had become so blurred, that I couldn't notice this error in time. We would regularly discuss the positive effects of the meds, or they'd highlight how the meds are helping in situations that weren't necessarily clear beforehand.  This was a person I could go to regularly, to process specific events, and I felt safe and secure that I'd be taken care of, without bias. Again, I had no other standard of comparison besides my own relationships with my clients, due to this being my first receiving therapeutic alliance.  One evening, my therapist sent me a text message asking me if I could let them have a few of my pills until their script could be refilled. I'd been asleep when it came through, but woke up in the middle of the night and read it. I'd gotten another unrelated, but concerning message from a friend around the same time, so I wasn't really in the proper head space to process either message. But even in my dazed state, I knew that boundary had been crossed. Mind racing...I say yes, then I'm out of meds for a few days. No? That hurts the relationship. I don't owe this person anything. That's not what this relationship is about. Will I get proper treatment after giving a no? That's when it became clear that this is the reason those boundaries get emphasized for us caregivers. That responsibility is on the giver to maintain that consistency. I struggled all day, ruminating. If they are crossing this ethical boundary, what else is being affected in my treatment? How can I know that my HIPAA rights are being respected, for example? I knew I had to end this relationship and replied, saying it made me highly uncomfortable, but that I'd like to speak about it in person.   We met that evening for our regular scheduled session, and I came right out, explaining how inappropriate and unethical I found this message to be. The fact that they shouldn't be relying on me for ANYTHING. I did get an apology, but it was quickly followed by a ""...however..."" The person ended up talking about offering other maintenance meds to long-term clients when they couldn't get their scripts in time. I get it, I said, it's still a serious violation, and totally illegal, but it's still forgivable since this person is *caring* for their clients' physical well-being. Egregious, but forgivable. The difference between that and my situation was the fact that *I* was being expected to assist someone who's being paid to work with *me.* This person went on to say sorry again, but they were under the impression this was a ""cool, give and take sorta deal."" Definitely didn't hear what I was saying. Another big red flag that is consistently emphasized in my work. Can't be doing good processing sessions if you're not hearing out your clients... This person went on to say they understand if I'd like to leave, but ""it's not necessarily a deal breaker,"" because we've come so far and we work so well together, and I should look at the big picture. I started discussing power dynamics, got a bunch of nonsense about how it's not quite that because they weren't *exerting* power over me. Again, unheard. The final straw however, was the textbook manipulation that I've come to recognize almost immediately and has become my pet peeve when it comes to other folks interacting with my child clients. This person began listing all the ""favors"" they've done for me...keeping me around for longer sessions that weren't billed accordingly, extra phone calls during minor crises, and the fact that they weren't being paid due to the coding issues. Do. Not. Hold. Shit. Over. Me. That. I. Didn't ask you for. At this point, my feelings of betrayal switched to confidence. Watching this person squirm and manipulate to get me to stay, and knowing the power is mine, and I'm not being affected by it at all. I offered to reach out to the insurance company one more time to make sure they get paid for sessions that we've already completed, but I wouldn't be coming back. Once again, I got the ""this shouldn't be a deal breaker, but you do what you need to do"" bit.  The entire conversation was extremely calm, and not heated in any way, but as we walked out to our respective cars, they ran back to my window one last time, and said, ""I know this goes without saying, but I'm asking you to not share this with anyone please.""  ""Sure, doctor, I wouldn't want to hurt you, but I don't want to be hurt anymore either."" After processing with a friend, another perspective was brought up that I should look into where I could turn to ensure that this experience doesn't happen to their other clients. I'm a bit anxious that after opening up with 2 years' worth of baggage, that it can be used against me, and there's a precedent that this person's ethical standards are subpar for the job.  I need to start shopping around for a new one, in order to process this relationship as well, but I do think it will be a struggle to place this much blind trust in another professional in the future. I'm grateful for this person for helping me grow and develop this ability to stick up for myself, but also very defeated that my ignorant bliss has been torn away. I have not met anyone in my personal life who had manipulated me this successfully, and it will most likely leave a mark on my ability to trust a professional other than myself. To be gaslit by the very person who was entrusted to make me a healthier human seems like one of the worst ways to experience this feeling, exception being an intimate partner.  Like I said, I'm very confident that I handled this in the best possible way, and am proud of how I handled this experience, but am very curious about outside feedback, as I am not comfortable opening up to friends and family about it in my personal life yet. Would love to brag about my newfound assertiveness, but ashamed of my being duped for so long.   TL;DR - Therapist crossed a serious ethical boundary after months of red flags, tried to manipulate me, and failed once I stood up for myself.","Wow I'm so sorry for your experience.  You sound completely in the right and this type of situation is absolutely reportable to this therapists licensing board if you decide to do so. I believe there are protections in place to protect your PHI if you should choose to report this boundary violation. I hope you find healing from this complete violation in trust, professionalism, and ethics. Good luck to you.",62
jqwvdt,I haven’t been feeling well but I needed a day to catch up and do somethings that were making me anxious. Catch up on chores etc... I work mostly 50 hour weeks nothing too special. I felt guilty doing it but is it a bad thing to do? Update: I took a day off today and I wanna thank all of you. It really means a lot. I’m so used to the notion that I should call out if I’m on death’s door. Once again thank you!,"Yes, it is a valid thing to do",57
jrf5hx, I can read books again. I can plan. I can think. I am almost too scared to admit how bad it actually got. I told myself I wouldn’t do that to my family but... I got pretty close. I was drowning in deep dark hole and there was no way out. There is a huge stigma in my profession for mental health issues. I was so scared my job would find out. I didn’t want to be dependent on antidepressants like my parents and sisters. I also did not want to kill myself like my brother. It’s silly looking back how resistant I was to even trying. For anyone on here who is scared or worried about starting meds- if you need to please at least try. We all need help sometimes.,"I’ve tried therapy, EMDR, more therapy, super intense in patient therapy. You know what ended up making me feel as normal and happy as I feel right now? Venlafaxine and dexafetamine, to combat the depression and ADHD at the same time. My living room is clean, and I don’t feel like life is meaningless. Try. Meds. Please. Being against them on principle will not make you magically feel better, save those principles for things like human rights or whatever. Mental health can often come down to simply lacking, or overproducing certain chemicals. That is a medical thing. Medication *could* very well help with that, just like with any other medical issue.",33
jryuyd,"why is it that when people give me criticism, especially when they do it in a harsh voice at work,  my first reaction is to get teary eyed and feel like crying while in my mind i have everything that i want to answer in an assertive and eloquent way but all i can do is response with “okay” in a shaky and low tone of voice?!!!! i hate this!! because oftentimes it costs me my ability to respond in a good way to speak up for myself!!","My first question may sound odd here, so bear with me. Did you grow up with overly critical parents, or put a lot of pressure on yourself? I grew up with overbearing and critical parents and people may think that, yeah, she's ok, she'll be fine. Nope, not so much. I'm made a bit more sensitive to critique that way because my parents needed to be better that me, have my self esteem deflated to not challenge them. They had issues either way. From this, I was given a trauma response where I can get very sensitive or teary eyed if I feel like I'm in a little bit of trouble. It sucks and yeah, I have to work on it too. I'm lucky I'm dealing with people that understand when I tell them ""it's not you, it's me on this. I got a bit of baggage"". I think that the more mature the manager is, the more likely they will know that you are taking responsibility especially if they are not yelling or being abusive or anything like that - it's just my body expects it.",45
js20ct," TW: descriptions of a car accident and injury I’ll start by introducing myself, I’m about to bare a piece of my soul to the Internet anyway, so you may as well know my name. I’m Sam. In January 2019 my life had finally, *finally* started to straighten out. I had a job that seemed like it was tailor made for me; I had only been there for about a month and I was already being looked at for a promotion. I was making more money than I ever had, doing some thing that I genuinely believed in and loved. I had moved in with my best friend, finally breaking out of my parents house. I had a new car, new place, new job, everything was coming up Sam.  I remember one night so clearly, one night where I felt so at peace, so happy with my place in life. A night where I finally felt like an adult, a put together person, a real grown-up! The Netflix series,  _Russian Doll_, had just come out and I spent all night watching it, curled up in my big comfy chair, in my tidy room, bong in my lap, dog asleep on my bed… Life was good. February 14, 2019. My Valentine’s date was with the back end of a semi truck with faulty brake lights. We met up at 65 miles an hour. I was airlifted to the hospital, and put into emergency surgery. I had broken my neck and completely severed my spinal cord, C5/C6 for those interested. I was left paralyzed from the sternum down and with paralyzed hands. My arms still move, albeit weaker, but my hands are completely paralyzed. Let me reiterate that last part: **my hands are paralyzed**. And honestly? And I mean this from the bottom of my broken little heart, that’s the worst part. Yeah, I can’t walk, I can’t roll over in bed to find a more comfortable position, I’m stuck in a power chair, but my *hands*. I can’t pick things up, I can’t make myself a meal, I can’t use a normal computer, but worst of all? I can’t paint. I’m a watercolor artist. I used to paint very small, very detailed paintings inspired by cartoons. I can still paint by strapping a paintbrush to my hand and moving my whole arm, but it’s hard, painful, bittersweet and imprecise. Which, actually, kind of describes my life in general at this point. Hard, painful, bittersweet, and imprecise. My favorite thing about myself used to be my independence, and I’ve lost it all. I haven’t been anywhere aside from doctors appointments since February. I don’t have a wheelchair accessible van, I don’t have a job, I don’t have a purpose, I have a hard time even thinking about what that could be.  There are so many losses I suffer through every day, losses of possibility. I spent a lot of time reading articles and watching videos on YouTube, seeing people do things and go places and I realize that I likely won’t ever get to do those things or see those places. I’ll see medieval castles, mountain tops, great archaeological sites that I could never access in a power chair. It’s that initial moment of, “oh cool! That would be awesome to see!“ And then immediately followed up with, “Oh… Nevermind.“ Every day I realize more and more of my dreams are dead. I’m scared. I don’t know what the rest of my life is going to look like, I didn’t know what it was going to look like before the accident, but my future felt full of possibilities. And now when I think about my future, it’s just an empty space full of hospitals and doctor visits. I’m not used to being scared of life.  I wish I had died in that car crash. This life is so hard. I don’t want this, I want my old self back. I don’t know who I am anymore. I’ve tried to find resources for coping with loss, but it’s all about coping with the loss of a loved one. How do you cope with the loss of yourself?","Hi Sam. I’m sorry for all the pain and suffering you’re going through. I’m sorry for all the losses you’re experiencing from the accident. I hope that you’ll find a new purposes and new skills going forward.  I’m glad that you’re alive, and that you’re here in the world with us. I’m sure your friends and family are grateful and thankful for that as well.  You write and communicate very well.  I don’t know if is a skill you can continue to hone to find your place in the world. I hope that over time, with practice and patience, you can paint in a way you like, perhaps with a surprising new style. I hope as the days progress, you will find many reasons to smile.",15
jsipoh,"I am 16yo and I am in highschool. Today I was at home with my little sister and my dad pulled up, he stayed outside for a while as usual and I stayed in my room as usual. I heard my sister crying so I went to see what was wrong, she said “nothing.” about five minutes later I heard my dad come in and he was talking to my sister, he said “You’re the only reason I didn’t pull the trigger.” and “Why even keep living you know, I mean...” and my sister responded “Don’t worry I want to do the same thing.”. The thing is my sister is 10. She has said when emotional “I just wanna die!” but that’s just because she is dramatic. I don’t think they know I heard them and I don’t know what to do. Do I confront them? Do I tell my mother? It is worth mentioning my dad is a drunkard and a former meth addict and my mother has said she wants to leave him and will far too many times. Also I’m worried something is wrong with me, when I started to think about what if he had shot himself I think about how it would ruin life for me. The lack of income and possible psychological repercussions effect on my future. I also think I need to cry more. I haven’t cried in forever.","holy crap this is a lot. i definitely feel like you should talk to someone about this. if you are close to your dad, reach out to him. tell him you care about him and that mental health is important. because it is! if you don’t want to bring it up with your dad, i would talk to your mom. this is not a thing that should be swept under the rug, in my opinion. another reminder: your mental health is important!! make sure to take some time for you :)",56
jstn7k,"Is this acceptable behaviour for a therapist?  Yesterday I told my therapist of 8 months that I would like to take a break from sessions. I had been feeling for a few weeks that I'm not getting much out of our time together. Prior to this she had always been helpful and insightful during each session. The sessions are eye-wateringly expensive, and as the UK has just been plunged into a second lockdown and I've lost a lot of work, finding the money for therapy has become much harder for me. Along with this, I also mentioned that I had started feeling ""too dependent"" on her- finding myself waiting for our session to roll around, not taking enough responsibility for my own mental state. I told her if I could afford to be in weekly therapy for the next 6 months, I would do it, as I believe it can work - but it's just not within my means to pay for something so expensive at the moment, especially given my progress has stalled. She has said in the past that she recommends if people can't afford therapy, that they ""eat a bit less"" to raise the money, which always struck me as a bit odd - at £430 a month, even if I stopped eating completely, it wouldn't begin to cover the cost! Anyway, having said that, I did feel like she had at this point given me some great tools to go forth with, and I felt confident that I could cope with a period of not having sessions, and be OK.  I told her all this, and what she said struck me as kind of ... off. She began by saying that if I stopped therapy now, I would essentially have no chance of getting better. That someone like me needs to be in therapy for at least a year, and that given that it wasn't the case that I ""literally can't afford it"", it was just an extra source of stress, me stopping now was in her opinion, a cop out. She said that all the things that are going well in my life at the moment because of therapy - my relationship with my parents, for example - are just in a honeymoon phase, and will certainly get worse if I stop sessions. She said my reasons for wanting to quit therapy were in completely in line with the core of my psychological issue (though she didn't describe what that actually is), that although I would immediately feel better if I stopped sessions (which I have to admit, has happened), sooner or later, my mental health would inevitably start to decline again. Now, I'm no therapist, but if I had a client who began to struggle paying for sessions and needed a break, my instinct would be to build them up as much as I can, remind them to use their tools, remind them how much progress they have made, and tell them that they \*can\* get through this. Instead what I got was essentially a ""you can't do this without me"".  The thing is... it didn't stop there!  She went on to tell me how busy she was, how many clients she had that day (11 hours with no break), how many clients she had to turn away each week, and told me that personally, she would greatly benefit from me stopping sessions, as she would prefer to use the hour she spends with me writing her book instead. She told me that I should remember that she doesn't ""take me home with her"" - I'm just a spot in her diary. I listened quietly, having said nothing to which this would have been an appropriate response. She also told me the reason she was late to our session was because she was reading an email from an anorexic client of hers, recently at death's door, saying how happy she was that she had spent the week eating freely and not obsessing about food. Again, I struggled to see the significance of her telling me this. I can only assume she was trying to demonstrate to me her skill as a therapist - something that ironically I had never questioned until this point.  She told me that regardless of my struggle to pay her, my wish to take a break from therapy was a cop out. I asked her what the protocol normally was for ending with clients. See, I didn't tell her this, but a small factor in my deciding to take a break from therapy was because she has also been seeing a friend of mine also for a few years now - a friend who has recently struggling with her mental health more than can I ever remember. On the back of having had a few weeks where I felt like my therapist's input had not been new or insightful, seeing my friend in this state after such a long time made me feel like there's no guarantee that my mental health would continue to improve. What was for sure, though, is that I would continue to feel the pinch of living beyond my means. My therapist offered me a reduction in fees, for which I was truly grateful. We talked about perhaps doing fortnightly sessions instead of weekly, and I asked whether I could go away and consider this before making a decision. She said - no problem, and remember - if you do take a break, you can come back and see me at any time. Now - this is where things got weird. In the last two minutes of the session, having agreed that I would go away and think about it, something in her flipped. It's hard to say what exactly happened, but it felt to me as if she had made some sort of snap decision that I was no longer worth her time.  I was explaining how the choice I have to make between paying my work-related costs and paying for therapy was causing me stress, when she abruptly cut in to say - ""You're right. You do need to stop therapy. Your thought processes are frankly ridiculous, I can't get seem to get through to you. I know this is abrupt, but I can see you're in some sort of ""zone"" here, and this is pointless, so... Good luck."" And then she ended our session, and hung up.  Her tone was impatient, irritable - not her usual therapy voice. I'm ok and I can take it, but honestly it was really jarring, especially considering that she had just spent the whole session assuring me of the bad things that would certainly befall me if I were to stop therapy. I respect her for not agreeing with me. I respect her clinical assessment in telling me I'm not ready. But telling me taking a break is a cop out because I'm not completely broke? Telling me that she'd be glad if I left because she'd rather be writing her book? Telling me that my thinking is ridiculous, (having previously said my thinking was ""crazy""), without saying why? Well, it was all a bit of a shock. I have always felt so lucky to have had a good therapist. Seeing her flail like that in her final hour has made question her, and the whole process.  Beneath my indignation at all this, I can feel that I’ve been left feeling hurt and disorientated. Part of me wonders whether that was intentional on her part - she has stressed in the past how smart she is, and how good she is at her job. Was this just a slip-up? Either way, I stand behind my decision. If I had to point to one main reason why I quit, I would say it was because the few times I expressed how powerless I felt in the therapy, she said ""You're not supposed to have the power. You're not the therapist, I am. The process is in my hands"".  And that, to me, just made no sense.  Thanks for reading til the end. Does anyone have any similar experiences, or insights into what actually went down here?","You had a bad therapist. Honestly, I'd report her. I've had lots of clients that struggled financially at times, and I always found a way to give them a break, either by scheduling delayed payments or just by working pro bono for 5-7 sessions, giving them a change to put some money aside in the meanwhile. To any therapist worth its salt, the therapeutic process and client's wellbeing are worth a lot more that money. I'd say you got lucky, so great for you! Good luck on your path to self-healing, and don't let yourself be discouraged to seeking out a new therapist as soon as you can afford it again!",117
jt8uzf,I can hear her notifications and her texting on her phone and can see the reflection on her glasses that she's on another page. I'm literally paying her to listen to me but she's not fully listening. I'm not really sure what to do or if I can even say anything. It kinda sucks when I feel like I'm sharing something I think is profound about myself but she doesn't acknowledge it as important. Or if I raise a concern but she doesn't help me unpack it.,"This happened to me. I would stop talking. Then, I finally brought it up and she claimed she was taking notes. Well, she stopped ""taking notes"" for a few more sessions. Then, it started up again. I found another therapist. I know it's hard to keep telling your story over again but you could also tell the new therapist why you had to switch, too. We deserve someone who is present with us. Yeah, maybe I wasn't going through a crisis during those times but even the T talked about creating a safe space for me to be and feel vulnerable. The bitch wasn't even listening...!",113
jt9f36,"First of all, I completely understand that this is their job and they deserve fair pay for what they do.  I have talked to them a lot about my relationship with money, that I’ve had many times in my life when my finances were not secure and it inundated my life, it was everything I thought about.  I have only recently over the past year or so have finally been feeling more secure, able to build some savings but of course I’m still weary of losing it all again (especially on my mind due to the pandemic) I have been seeing this therapist for a few months and have been often frustrated with my pay at work because I had to take on a lot more responsibilities over the past 8 months that are not in my job description. They knew how frustrated I was because I brought it up quite often. I finally! got a raise last week and I was/am so excited. It is not that significant of a raise, far from life changing, and I still have 50k in student loan debt to chip away at (which they know). I was so excited to tell them about my raise at the beginning of our session and they did say congratulations, that they are happy for me. Then basically immediately said “This can be a discussion, but let’s talk about raising the cost for these sessions since you did just get a raise” I was so taken aback because I immediately felt like I am just income for them, that their eyes turned to money signs when I said I got a raise. I let them know Id have to look at my budget and talk with my partner.  And again, I totally understand...their work is so important and just like I’ve been frustrated with my pay, they are entitled to be as well. We agreed on a cost a few months ago, and although it was a bit high for me even then, I agreed because I was in a really bad spot mentally. I haven’t even gotten my first paycheck with my raise (and won’t until the end of the month). I’m not against having this discussion with my therapist but bringing it up immediately after I was so excited to tell them, was hurtful and turned me off from them.  Would love anyone’s thoughts on this. Am I being entitled? Am I in the wrong? Totally open to that type of criticism...a lot of what I am feeling is emotional pain and I understand that is not always logical. Thank you for your thoughts :)","Wowzers. Instead of celebrating something wonderful in your life, your t made it about her - that she also wants a raise. That was not the time to raise the issue and was definitely inappropriate.  The other thing is, if I got a raise, I’d put it all towards debt and building an emergency fund (because, Covid). It wouldn’t make me rich, it would just be an stabilization. Unless she knows your whole financial situation, she’s just assuming. But that’s beside the point.",172
jtlfuo,"Last year I decided to take harder classes. The ones I was targeting were science, math and computer sciences. Last year in these classes I was doing so well that I had the daily work assigned done in half a class period and week long projects took me an hour to complete. This year for lack of better words I feel like a complete idiot. Even to get a basic understanding of the content is hard for me, I cant focus or stay motivated long enough to finish work and I just dont know what to do at this point. Its not the new classes I'm struggling with either, the real kick in the teeth was when I was helping my girlfriend with her math homework. Im a year ahead in math so I had already done all of it and she struggles with math so I offer help. I was as lost as her if not more, I had gone from doing a days worth of work in 20 minutes to a 15 minute assignment in an hour. I dont know whats going on but it isnt getting better.","I completely feel you I did the exact same thing and was feeling super unmotivated this entire semester. I was failing every class so I came up with a system:  1. Get an agenda. This helped me organize everything I had to do for the entire week  2. Work in chunks. I was so stressed with all of the things I had to do that I couldn’t focus. I decided to work on one or two classes worth of material per day  3. Take breaks! Even if it’s for 5 minutes make sure you take a break to grab a snack or some water  4. Don’t wear yourself too thin it’s a weird time now with the pandemic, and just remember that you’re not alone.  5. And my last point, just remember how much you’ve worked to get to where you are in college. That requires a lot of work, and I’m a strong believer in the fact that you’re not gonna be placed in a situation you can’t handle. You can do this. In the words of the amazing Kris Jenner, “you’re doing amazing sweetie” ❤️",30
ju6asc,"It is so hard to reach out for help and for my therapist to say after 2 sessions that she feels ethically and medically (this wasn't like an I developed feelings or something, inappropriate, we had 2 sessions one of which I spent mostly listing my conditions and the meds I take for them) that she shouldn't be the one to treat me, even though she specializes in CPTSD and EMDR therapy...I just...she fired me basically is how I feel and I'm now hurting even more because I'm so tired of fighting these systems to try to get help.","I am sorry you went through this. I hope you find the right fit in network. I have had one therapist open up to me about their reason for suddenly having to drop service. They revealed that they were actively working through a situation that so closely resembled a past trauma of mine that I was regularly discussing in therapy. They were apologetic that they were not, at this time in their life and practice, able to remain objective during our sessions, and it was not fair to me that their circumstances and psychological needs adversely impact my care. I understood that such vulnerability was, for that therapist, potentially too much personal exposure to a client. I was thankful for their disclosure and I left in peace, but I also took with me an important lesson: I have no idea what others, even those trusted to care for me, are struggling with. Now, when ghosted, I admittedly project that story onto what I don’t know about the current abandonment. I tell myself that person was struggling with something they did not feel they could tell me about, and they had to make an abrupt boundary to protect themselves and me from what they were going through. It was not personal. I can forgive, wish them well, and move on without resentment. Even if the projection is totally false, it has proven much more fulfilling to my psychology than erring on the other side and continuing to resent situations I cannot control.",156
jurtqy,"This was just a very rewarding moment for me. I went from fearing that my friends would judge me for going to therapy/being medicated to suddenly being someone they felt they could reach out to for support. This experience has drastically shifted my comfort level with openly talking about my struggles with mental health and has also made me feel much less alone/isolated in my struggles.  You are not alone. Dont be afraid to speak honestly and openly about mental health. Chances are, many of the people you know are in a similar boat. Seek out help if you need it, it's nothing to be ashamed about.","Well done, and this is so nice to hear!  Have found it really hard to be open with my friends about therapy, and room mates is a whole different story as we’re not that close...

jvblsk,"For context, I am a new therapist. I started my first job in community MH a little over a month ago. A common complaint I hear is anxiety (no surprise there). I currently have a handful of adolescents on my caseload that were brought in under their parent's will. It's not that they are resistant, but they are not particularly engaged in treatment either. I'm getting a very neutral response in that I am hearing a lot of ""I just get anxious"" and a lot of ""I don't knows"". While I am still in that stage of building rapport, I'm curious what are some things you wish your therapist (or anybody) would have said to you as a teenager with an ""unexplainable"" anxiety or things that they did say that made you feel you were in a safe place?","Something I can answer! I am a teen, and I have to admit I answer a lot of my therapists questions with “I don’t know”. I barely talk because I feel kind of scared in session. First of, I just want to apologise for making your job so hard :( I honestly don’t mean too, I promise!  Now some tips to get them to open up a little more:  1) make them feel safe. If I don’t feel safe with someone, I will not say anything. To do this, try to interact with them in a way they feel comfortable. If they are very quiet or shy maybe talk calmly and at a steady pace. If they are happy and exited, share that excitement with them!  2) Try to stick to what you tell them. I know this one might seem obvious, but telling them that you will do something, and then not doing it can delay how long it takes for the trust to form.  3) Ask direct questions. Idk if it’s because i get anxious, or because I don’t really get social hints, but I personally find it hard to answer questions that are vague.

jvmbub,"I just want to say that I participated in a free therapy program for therapists getting their degree this year and it was such a great experience that I’m so grateful for.  The local university offers free therapy for locals based on a first come first serve basis. These are therapists working to get their degree and need the hours in order to complete it. I was very skeptical but also excited at the prospect of free therapy for a few months. With my EAP, I could almost afford a weird conglomeration of therapy for a full year. I may have lucked out but my therapist was amazing. We clicked right away. I thought the fact that they were the same age as me and inexperienced would be weird, but it all turned out perfectly. I reached out to the university program based on a referral from my boss (the HR Director!) I missed the deadline for 2019 and so I put it in my calendar for 2020 and plan to do the same next year...although I’d be surprised if I’m that lucky again.  My therapist always remembered our previous discussions, she compassionately validated my feelings while also challenging them. She gave me tools and advice. She shared in my joy and pain.  I contacted the program due to some childhood trauma, depression and also cleanliness. We focused on topics in each session that were on my mind but she always made sure to bring it back to my goals. I will say, we started out in person and moved to virtual. Our sessions were recorded and viewed by their professor either way. I thought that would make me uncomfortable but I just put it out of my mind. Our in person sessions were definitely better and it was easier to focus, but the zoom ones were great too since we had already established a relationship.  Our sessions ended about 6 months ago. I loved our sessions but I wasn’t really sure if they changed me at all. So I just want to say that cleaning was almost always a  negative experience in my childhood. Not to get into the details but I do realize how bad it was now and why I have an aversion to it.  Anyway, I had a thought yesterday - I have been able to keep my place “satisfactory” for the last 6 months+. Sure, I’ve had a few weeks where things get a little out of control, but nothing to the extent of before my therapy. And you know what? I think a lot of it was due to my therapy with this “student”. Being able to talk to someone about it and just have them validate my feelings made me feel more empowered to deal with it. I know I’m not “cured” but I feel stronger in my abilities. In conclusion, I miss her and secretly hope that I will find her when she’s licensed and be able to see her again, even though I know that’s probably not likely. In short, try every avenue available to you! And also! Thank you to all the therapists out there who are focusing on their clients, remembering/reviewing details about their clients, not looking at their phones during sessions, and those who generally care about their clients and the work they’re doing. You might never see it, but it matters!",I’m so glad to hear you had a positive experience! Therapists in training really can be just as good as the more experienced professionals (or better) if they’re a good fit for you! Thanks for sharing your experience.,32
jwhham,"So I'm 15 and recently just now being told the awful things my mom has done. For example I found out she was high on meth and stole my dads truck and wrecked it while she was pregnant with me. Then I found out that she tried to do enough meth to kill me but not her. When that didnt work she tried to inject something in her stomach to abort me again. I feel disgusted and hate towards her. So many times when I was younger I helped her when she was on drugs. I cooked for her when she was passed out on the couch and wouldn't wake up no matter what. Then she has the audacity to want me to come live with her now that she's clean and ""found jesus"". While saying all this I also feel pretty damn powerful because she doesnt know that I know. So the next time she wants to start arguing about something I do that's not ""holy"" enough. Ima give her one chance to quit before I put her on blast. I just dont know how to feel about my life since I know that I wasn't supposed to be here. I also would like to know if it's ok to tell my school therapist because I dont want to be taken away or anything like that. TLDR; My mom tried to abort me twice with drugs and doesnt know that I know. EDIT: thanks to all of you, I dont have time to respond to most of yall but I'm trying to read them all while getting my work done. Thank yall.","YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

jx2mla,"So... I lived in a household of 4. It was my mom, my grandparents and myself. Now it's just the 3 of us.    Here's some backstory:    My grandfather raised me. I've never met my biological father, but it didn't matter because I had my grandfather. I've been by his side since I was born. I always followed him everywhere and I learned everything I know from him. He taught me to analyze and problem solve which is not a skill everyone possesses.    Anyways...    My mom has worked at a job for 21 years. During the pandemic, the company went under and was forced to sell, so she was left unemployed in September. I came up with a plan that she get on unemployment for a little bit while the pandemic is happening so 1.) she could be safe, but 2.) so we could apply to a few different positions that would be upgrades from her previous job. Considering she had 21 years of experience, we could find her something that had better pay and benefits.    I thought it was a solid plan...    My grandmother got in her head and convinced her that she needed to apply for a job ASAP, even if it was low level and a step down from the job she had before. I talked to her again and tried to convince her that it was illogical and that my plan made more sense in the long run. Nope, she decided to follow what my grandmother said and applied with the company that bought the company she worked for before.    Sure enough, there's a manager there and right away my mom disliked him because he was very condescending. He was much younger than everyone who worked there and he was also quite careless. He got sick and would show up to work without wearing a mask. In fact, he got tested for Covid and it came back positive but he showed up to work the next day as a ""surprise"" to the staff.    So my mom ends up getting sick and decides she was going to quit because of the manager and the ""hostile"" environment. So she quits after being there for 3 weeks and brings it home and of course all 4 of us get Covid with pneumonia.    Anyways, long story long, my grandpa didn't survive Covid and I feel lot's of regret because I couldn't be there to comfort him during his struggle. I couldn't be there as they removed the breathing tubes and he slowly suffocated for a day. I couldn't be there for any of it. And since I was sick, my last interaction with him was calling him on FaceTime and telling him that I loved him before the ambulance took him. It kills me because now that he's gone I'm hearing that he was scared and he didn't want to be intubated...    I'm mad at my mom because I came up with a plan for her... It was a solid plan. And get this... after she quit her job, she came home and applied for unemployment and started applying for better jobs JUST LIKE I HAD ADVISED HER TO!!!    Why quit now though? You killed my grandpa so why quit now? Why listen now? Go back to your job and stay there...",My anger would have been directed at the manager who knowingly gave Covid to his employees.,138
jxlshy,I don’t get it,"Maybe its a feeling of being put on the spot, or like, its hard to be vulnerable with your therapist if you haven't warmed up to them yet?",46
jyft3x,"I’m not in immediate danger now, but sail close to the wind sometimes and I wonder how anyone else copes with these feelings. Beyond just waiting for it to pass.","Try talking to someone you care about and feel safe with. You don't have to mention suicide specifically if you don't feel safe enough to do so at first, maybe start small with just a little piece of it. People can't show you they care about you and want to help you if you don't give them a chance to. If I can't talk to someone I care about in the moment I try to think about how much it will hurt the people I care about or how much I'll miss out on if I'm not around to see them in the future or how I might be able to help the people I care about in the future if I can just hold on now. It's not perfect but I've been dealing with this for 20+ years and I've managed to get by so far.",23
jyksum,"Firstly, most of what I'll say here may be very disturbing, I hope no one will use it against me, just know it wasn't my choice and I'm willing to do anything to treat it, that is just better than hiding it from everyone, so I hope I won't be hated for seeking help. And I hope sexual mentions aren't against the rules. So the problem is, I can feel sexually attracted to anyone and anything. Mostly it's if I find the person/object cute or feel comfortable with them or love them or anything that makes them significant to me. What this means is, I can feel sexual attraction to my Mac. Notice I'm using ""can"" because I can still control my feelings, but that's pretty much repressing it and I don't think it's real treatment. I'm sorry I have to make it more obvious, but it goes from a very close friend, to my pets, to my relatives, to children. I don't think I'm a pedophile, zoophile, or all of these disorders at the same time, because none of them feel special. What I mean is, the reason is never that they're a child, animal or anything, it is always because of the emotional attraction. In a way you could say I turn all kinds of love into sexual ones. Some examples of that would be feeling sexual arousment by emotionally intense conversations with my girlfriend, for example when we're telling each other that we love each other, generally when I feel safe and comfortable. Another, more disturbing example would be me feeling sexual arousment by seeing a child, of course I don't let myself feel anything, but the initial thought is there, until I almost instantly shut it down. I obviously do not like this, I do not want to be this and even though I know it isn't exactly my fault because I haven't chosen to be this, I can't stop hating myself, I feel so guilty about it and I would do anything for it to go away, for me to be normal again. Another thing that concerns me is, I don't feel disgust by most of the disturbing things. I can talk about, and even see, anything disgusting, like cannibalism, rape etc. without much disgust. Of course I don't enjoy it, it's just that I'm pretty much numb about it, I do feel consciously sad those kind of stuff actually happen though. If it's relevant, I've been through a phase where I denied all emotions and impulses, including disgust, as a coping mechanism. That was more than a year ago though, and lasted about a year itself, gradually getting more extreme. I hate this for so many reasons, not only does it make me a digusting person, I have to keep my self control to keep myself from doing disgusting things, and it scares me because I might lose my self control, for example because of alcohol, or not realise it's disgusting, not to mention it makes me dishonest with everyone because they don't know how I feel towards them, neither does my girlfriend. She knows this disorder of mine though, and I feel like I'm unloyal, guilty and dishonest to her. All of this really makes me hate myself. I hope someone is out there to show me how I can get better because I've done some research and couldn't find anything relevant. I can't thank anyone that's willing to help enough. I am sorry for being this, thank you for reading.","You should 100% talk to a psychotherapist and maybe a psychiatrist. They will be able to determine what the best treatment is, not random people on the internet.  If I'm understanding you correctly.... You have sexual thoughts, sexual-physiological reactions to, everything??? Like you can look at your car or a computer and feel physically aroused in your genitals? Or is it more of an emotional-romantic connection?  Sexuality is complex. Being sexually aroused by someone usually gives you physical-reactions (getting a boner, or getting wet, getting sweaty palms or flushed in the body/chest).  Most people also have romantic-reactions (wanting to be close to them, getting a warm feeling when you think of them, wanting to go on dates with them and imagine yourself kissing them or cuddling them). You can also have emotional-reactions (feeling protective or jealous when someone hurts them or spends more time with them than you do, worrying for them, caring about their wellbeing, enjoying their company, caring about their thoughts, emotions, opinions). I want to point out that its 100% possible to have NONE of these feelings, have all of them, or only have a few. For example, many demisexual people ONLY feel sexually aroused by someone, if they already feel emotionally-into someone, so they won't want to have sex with someone unless they care deeply about them. Where-as a straight woman might be able to look at a man and want to have sex with him, based on how he looks, without knowing his personality. So, sexuality is complex. If you are able to feel attracted to MANY different types of people, its possible you are pansexual.   Another thing to keep in mind, is sexuality is also biological. Your ability to get ""aroused"" physically is impacted by your biological-hormones. If you have unbalanced hormones, then you could have an over-active sex drive or an under-active sex drive. If you are feeling like your sex-drive is out of control, you should speak to your doctor and figure out what is going wrong in your body first. However if the feelings you have are mostly mental (like seeing a child and suddenly an image of having sex with them pops into your mind) its possible that you have a mental-illness that is causing you to have these unwanted thoughts. Many people with OCD have unwanted thoughts (sometimes violent or sexual in nature) that they would 100% never do, but can't stop thinking about.  What ever is going on, I would talk to your doctor and a a therapist of some sort.",37
jypi2k,"Over the past couple of months, my life and mental health took a nose dive. There has been many times where I've been suicidal and reached out to this subreddit, and you guys always restored my faith in humanity. At the time i felt: hopeless, worthless, lonely, insignificant and small. But things have really gotten good over the past 48 hours. I am happy to say that i have met an amazing woman who loves me unconditionally, and i just formed a band with 2 other talented musicians who i am good friends with.  Last night, after having 2 previous all-nighters. I still couldn't sleep. So, I decided to smoke weed and listen to the album 'Lateralus' by the band TOOL; and it completely changed my outlook on life. I realized that my life is only as bad as i make it.

jztngk,"Edit 11/24/2020 Thank you for the overwhelming response. I didn't even remember posting this until my phone blew up with a world of support. I've had Reddit for a year but I've sparingly used it up until recently.  The response and *actual help* has been incredible and life changing.  My apologies as well, I was reviewing what I wrote below and realized none of my 'intended punctuation' actually happened. Thanks for sticking with the run-on sentences in my dark hour. I woke up and got into an argument with my spouse and it caused me to spiral, thus finally reaching out to Reddit to vent.  You are all incredible, thank you for showing me this side of reddit.  ️️️  I've had chronic depression since I was 9 It started to build when I was 7 with my personal life I'm a high functioning depression with a job, a mortgage, a wife, and many things on my plate The feeling of wanting to die, the suicidal stigma is always in the back of my mind and I feel like it haunts me I do dishes, laundry, chores, and I keep myself constantly busy until I'm burnt out everyday It gives me an excuse to feel important, and I'm only useful if I'm used for tasks or chores I don't find any joy in life anymore No amount of rest will help me I oversleep In my day off I slept 24 hours and refused to eat with no appetite Everyone is fine with me doing chores and running myself dry until I actually stop doing those things I think I'm going to get a divorce soon because my partner can't handle my symptoms after 7 years of being together Life really doesn't get better I wish I could sit here and give some inspirational thought to help others But mental health is only for the rich I'd love to go to a mental health institution, but i don't want to lose my income or be thousands in debt I want to carve time to work in myself I have better help therapy and do an hourly visit once a week It's still never enough I'm on 75mg of Amitriptyline and 300mg of bupropion I have klonapin for panic attacks It's still never enough So here's to you kid, It doesn't get better There is no white light No one comes to save you You just keep fighting for those you love until you can't fight anymore I've had to make peace with the fact I'll never be happy and I'm only meant to serve That my dreams and aspirations don't matter in the grand scheme of life and I'm doomed to existing It's too expensive to die. Ten thousand for the average funeral. I have life insurance, but you have to wait three years before they start covering for a possible suicide because by then you've paid your dues I'm incredible tired I don't see a way out I'm posting here to vent, I know I'm not the only one who feels the hopeless despair Know you're not alone. But know you're on your own. You can't count on anyone. No family, no friends, no love I've hit rock bottom and I've made a dent in my stay here But there's only one way to go from here... Up. Or Plateau.","I'm sorry you're going through this right now. I hope you can find a way out. If there's anything we can help with, ask. Remember that being down/depressed is nothing to be ashamed of, that's a lot of people, and a lot of famous ones at that. I'm not sure how to help, or if you want any. If you want anything, I wrote things I'm trying below. Hang in there. At the moment I know that I have days where I feel better, or at least used to have them. I know that depression is a part of my brain that's trying to protect me from things like embarrassment, shame, ridicule, etc by being hyper-vigilant for them and making them up when they're not there, so I'll be ""ready"" and just never do anything that could cause any of those things. I know that I'm human, don't know everything, can't tell the future, can't read minds and honestly don't know myself that well. So I know that when my head tells me that I'm 100% doomed, a total piece of shit, and that no one loves me, it's lying. It ***can't*** know those things as absolutely as it claims because I don't know *anything* that certainly, and it only knows what I know. So I'm trying to just ride the sad when it comes. It's okay to feel it. It's okay to feel weak, pitiable, and broken. My feelings are valid and real. **But** I don't have to act on them. They're not *true*. I know my gut is against me, so I'm trying to guage when I'm actually really down and just avoid thinking about life goals or philosophy or my own worth at those times, because I know that the person leading the discussion is delusional. They're a dear friend, but I don't need to listen hard to their conspiracy theories. One thing I want to try soon is something I talked about with my therapist last week. A lot of people use shame/fear to motivate themselves. I finally do the dishes because I'm afraid of getting a talking-to by my roommate, etc. When we do this, we're visualizing a painful thing and that is enough to stress us out and trick our body into associating that thought with pain. It doesn't matter if that painful event every actually happens. The act of imagining it is enough to create those neuron connections. My therapist suggested that you can do the same the other way. If you can motivate yourself with the fear of entirely theoretical pain, you can do it with imaginary pleasure/reward too. They suggested that I could try to think of life goals, values, and events that, when I think about them, give me that warm, fuzzy, glowy happy feeling. For me it's solving a really hard puzzle in a personal project, or having friends over when I feel prepared/like a good host, etc. The idea is, when you need to do something, figure out one of those goals that your task could possibly be a step toward, and hold that *feeling* in your head. Try to focus on the glowy, satisfied feeling of the goal/event that this task helps you accomplish, even if it's just the relief of having a good day. The idea is that if you do this enough, you can trick your brain/body into thinking that the task you need to do is what's giving you that dopamine/serotonin. last: the podcast ""The Hilarious World of Depression"" is nice for feeling *seen*. It can be pretty heavy and includes explicit conversation about drug use and suicide, but it's made up of interviews with comedians about their experience of depression and other mental illness. It's not really that funny, but it's so nice to not feel alone in this, and even that people can succeed despite it.",41
k0fcvf,"My therapist does regular depression tests. He forgot for about a month, but I finally remembered to remind him today. Emailed him my answers after therapy, and asked him to tell me any change. He said my score has gone from the mid-teens to a 4! He said, ""Doing wonderful man, should be proud of yourself."" And you know what? I **am** proud of myself. I've been doing a lot of work in and out of therapy to get better. I've been advocating for myself at my psychiatrist's office, I got into a lab at my school (which does the kind of research I *dream* of doing), I've gotten my grades up from D's to B's to all A's and one B, I'm VP/co-VP of two clubs on campus, I'm staying active...

k0r6d3,"I feel empty and lost. I have an established relationship with a new therapist and it is going well. But I have had this therapist since a young teen into my late 20's and I feel like I didn't say what I wanted to when we ended tonight. So I feel like I am gonna say it here. She has helped me through so much. Manage my anger, my trauma, my panic attacks, and literally saved my life. I have had so many nights of wanting to die, but she pulled me through. I feel like I went into savior complex and didn't want to get emotional and pretend I was going to be okay, so she would feel better, which I know is stupid. I know I will get through this and I look forward to working with my new therapist, but this is such a heavy loss. I have so much left to say to her","Therapy is such a weird type of relationship because in what other circumstances would you just leave somebody permanently after they helped you so much?! At the same time, every relationship ends and ultimately we often don’t have control of when. Now’s a time to notice the painful feelings this causes for you, like really notice them in your body. Try not to beat yourself up about the fact that those feelings are there, because like all feelings they exist for a reason. What are they trying to do for you?  Sounds like in this case, they’re serving as a reminder of how important this relationship has been in your life. You can honor that by doing what you’re doing now, sharing about it, and by continuing to notice and appreciate everything your therapist taught you. Going forward in hard moments, you can now ask yourself “what would they say to me right now?” As weird as it might sound, we can kind of carry with us the voices and support of people who were there for us in the past, and be stronger for it. I can almost guarantee to you that that’s what your therapist would want for you. Take care.",51

k1r9tu,"I' m not sure if this is the right community for this, but here it goes. I recently got a therapist/counselor, and she went over all of the rules about what she can and can't tell my parents by the first visit. I don't want my parents knowing about some of the things I tell her, but my dad always demands to get a summary of everything I said from her after our session. I signed a form in which I said that she CANNOT give him summaries. Problem is, she gives him summaries after *every single session*. She never asks me what I wouldn't want her to tell him before he's in the room. She always waits until my dad asks a probing question to ask if she can, which puts me in an impossible situation because I know my dad will punish me if I say no. Last session it got the worst, because I told her something, and she asked me if she could tell my parents, and I said no. Then as soon as my dad came in after our one-on-one, she told all of it to him. What should I do? Is what she did even legal, considering I signed an agreement?

I'm 27 and have only been in one relationship my whole life. my ex and I have been on and off for the last 4 years and he just dumped me again...one of the reasons being that having sex is physically painful for me. I've been to doctors, gynecologists and no one can figure it out. my ex left me for an 18 year old (he's 31 btw) and I'm so embarrassed and feel awful about myself. I can't bring myself to date again and just feel terrible. So I went to therapy. my therapist is an older man in his 60s or 70s.

No one will want to be with me anyways.""

k32cgd,"Hello, I decided to post this just to get it off my mind. I am very young and unfortunately I am already going through a divorce. For the background context, I met my wife through a  friend. We lived in different states. We had been talking for about 6 months before we decided to met each other in person. I flew out to California to meet her. The whole experience was great. Anyways we had a couple more amazing trips and started dating. A year later she moved out to me. We had been going well, but we ran into an issue. im in the Military and was getting put on orders. I am going to Italy and I had already knew that I wanted to marry her. the only way for her to go was to get married. We talked about spending a life together. Anyway I proposed and life was great. Before we got married I made sure she was ready for all of it. She said she was and was excited. We went through with it and then the issue came. Guys from work would give her attention and she would tell them to stop, but kept talking to them outside of work and they got worse. I let her know i was a little uncomfortable and she picked them over me. Later she said she had feelings for another man. I was devastated. I have always loved her and we did have issues, but I always tried to fix them Anyway, now we are here and she doesn't even want to try. I cant see how you can love someone so much and they just give up on you without any effort. How do you deal with such an intense amount of pain. Ive been trying to fight for her for a couple weeks, but all she does is go to parties and stuff like that. Most of the time i get ignored. I realize it's time to move on. She is not the person I thought she was. Im just asking for advice on making things easier. I'm sick of my heart hurting everyday. Thank you.","The healthiest way through heart break is to just go through it. If you just let yourself feel the pain without numbing it out you'll process it quicker. Yes it hurts very much. But these emotions can't kill you (even though it feels like that).  In general you shouldn't keep the mindset ""how can you love someone so much and they just give up on you without effort"".

k3ctpe,"It took me so long to figure it out but I finally found content in myself. I used to downgrade myself all time because I never thought I was good enough. I felt hopeless as I could be good enough for my art teacher and she always favored another student in the class. It was traumatic because all myself worth was based on my ability to do art. I lost every competition and didn’t even make it a government art program. Even though I accepted what happened, I never lost that feeling of insecurity.  The feeling insecurity transferred to other areas. I was insecure that I couldn’t never get a girlfriend. I eventually got a girl from online. I took it for granted and I thought it wasn’t good enough. I thought I had to be player/jock just like everyone idolized in highschool.  I feel awful for realizing that I took her for granted.

k3pxie,"I won’t go into too much detail but when I was a toddler, about 3 or 4, I was molested by my neighbor. I blocked out the memory for most of my life but remembered it when I was trying EMDR on my own. This was a couple years ago, I still haven’t told anyone. I’m a male and it scares me to tell anyone about it because that feels so taboo. I see all these trends every now and then where girls come out about being molested or raped and I’m very glad that they have the courage and support to do that, but it pains me to see other people having so much support and love when I know if I did it it would most likely just be ignored and seen as gross or too uncomfortable.","I think that what your neighbor did to you was gross, for sure.  But YOU are not gross.  And that was something that took me almost 20 years to fully grasp... you are not dirty or gross because of what someone else did to you.  You are still you.  You can overcome this.   I’m sorry this happened and just know it might take some time to tell them.  You’re gonna be alright.  Are you in a safe position to tell your family?  Is the neighbor still around?  I would break it to your mom first, if that makes sense for you guys.  Whoever is the most emotionally available.   But, even if your parents dont get it, you will still be okay. Therapy and friends can go a long way.

k42n1c,"25M Hey everyone, I recently started going to therapy because of a failed relationship which made me realize that I thrive off of toxicity and drama (my therapist doesn't believe my actions constitute emotional abuse but I am still not sure). It just feels like toxicity is so normal to me that even when a situation is completely positive I look for something to complain about or poke fun at or get angry over despite knowing it may hurt or upset those around me. I also can get very uncomfortable when someone expresses warmth towards me, especially when they say that they think I'm a good person.  I'm working on getting progressively more aware and empathetic towards the people around me but I can't help but feel like I'm fighting a losing battle sometimes where I'm just getting better at hiding toxic traits rather than actually putting a stop to them. What I'm wondering is, is it really possible to ""unlearn"" traits that you've carried for as long as you can remember?","I'm at a stage where I have to unlearn bad behavior against myself.

During my panic attack I info dumped to her the fact it was my first time and that I was bisexual (as her). She didn’t seem too bothered and the fact that she was super nice in trying to calm me made me realize I was developing feelings for her.

ka1n5c,"I’ve had weight problems my whole life. At my highest, I weighed 455lbs when I was 22 years old. By the time I was 24 I had weighed 335. Now over the course of the pandemic I have put weight back on. I now weigh 350. I know I’m gonna get my shit together and take care of it, that’s not my concern. My concern is that Christmas is coming up, and I was looking forward to eating spending the holiday in sweatpants, watching movies and eating my soon to be mother-in-laws delicious Christmas cookies.  I won’t be able to do that. I am so afraid of judgement now that I’ve put weight back on that I won’t be able to enjoy myself. In addition to that, I feel like I’m connecting my worth as a person with my success at loosing weight. Sometimes I think people think less of me because of my weight.  I’m not really doing the thought justice here so let me try this. I see a non-overweight person wearing comfortable clothes and relaxing with a beer or glass of wine, and I think to myself something along the lines of “you can’t do that, cause you’re not normal”","Not quite sure what you're asking as there seems to be a few questions but will do my best.  Why do i link my self worth to my weight - there could be many reasons. Possibly messages in early life that thin=desirable /loveable/normal? Maybe negative experiences of people's perception of you when you were overweight? You can choose to override these messages though Decide others are judging me - do you have evidence that others are judging you negatively? If so why does that matter to you? What do you fear others are thinking? Is it the same as how you judge yourself for being overweight (if so you should work on how you are judging yourself), even if people are judging you why should that mean you can't enjoy cookies at Christmas?  Just because you're not at the weight you want to be it doesn't make you abnormal or worth any less as a person. If people are judging you that does not make their judgements true. I hope you can manage to enjoy Christmas the way you want to",23
kbyy7j,"This is my first post, I didn't know where else to go for actual advice as I don't have access to therapy. **I'm putting a warning for probably unwanted details***  I've been having such a hard time coping with this. I didn't live with her so the last time I got to visit was mid October, I made plans to visit again for my 19th birthday on Nov 4. She had been really sick for a few months so I tried to visit as often but didn't want to risk getting her sick with covid going on and such. My fiance and I left around 4am nov 2 and drove the couple hours after getting a call she was moved to ICU. Her liver was failing and one of her lungs failed. She could see me there with her and, I could see in her eyes how excited she was to see me but when she tried to talk she realized she couldn't and just gave up and stared off, her eyes glazed over, skin so dry and yellow.. all I could do was hold her hand and cry into the mask I was wearing. They would only let me go in alone. I sat with her, I even waxed her eyebrows for her like she had begged me to on our last phonecall a few nights before. Later the doctor  had explained that her liver couldn't process the pain meds, her heart was failing, the respirator could only be induced for so long due to humidity buildup, but she couldn't breathe on her own either. So, no matter what she was pretty much doomed. By that time they allowed my nana in with me (my mom's mom) and gave us the decision. After calling my 16 yo brother we finalized the decision, and she passed only a few minutes later, we sat with her for a while, I lied on her chest for the last time which I I found comforting as morbid as that might sound. A week later a funeral was held. Seeking support from my father was a mistake, as he's upset because by law he'll have to pay child support to me, since my brother lives with me and we're taking care of him. I'm not sure what to do, I try to keep myself busy with work, I still feel like there's something missing. We talked about trying for a baby but financially we aren't ready. I'm also coping with PTSD sometimes I'll smell certain smells or feel a texture that triggers it and it's definitely taking time to get used to. Thank you for listening to my life issues I know everybody's got their own. Anything to cope or anyone with similar experience I'm in need of advice <3","Thank you for sharing very vulnerable experiences and putting your trust in the process. Not only do you have grief and the loss of your mom, but also the support she gave you. There's no right way to grief -- you're probably gonna feel all sorts of anger, sadness, grief,  denial, pleading, and so on. Just like every other human. You can rest assured to expect that you might not know what to expect to feel coming up. And that's OKAY. You made a big choice that you shouldn't have to. You and your brother. I can't imagine having that kind of support. Thank goodness you got to share that responsibility with someone. And, it's really beautiful that you spent some time with your mom after her passing. I hope you can look at that moment with peace, knowing you were there for her. What's going on with your father -- well, it is very much tied into this experience. And so with him, many of your emotions too. If you need to not think about that for a while and focus on you, you can do that. With that suggestion -- I would just recognize that your coping is going to look unique. You can ask yourself, 'what do I need right now?', 'What would help me in this moment?', 'How do I feel right now and what do I need to feel comforted in this moment?', and you can remind yourself that it's okay if you don't know what you need. Even that recognition is coping because loss leaves us in a wilderness of sorts. There, sometimes we just need the basics. Food if we feel like eating, clothes for security, walls for privacy or the safety of shared grief, and the presence of someone who we know can just say, 'I'm here if you need me to just be here and nothing else."" If you write, write. If you listen to music for comfort, play your tunes. If you do art, then put your feelings in to your medium. If you walk, walk. Whatever you need it perfectly acceptable way to cope. If you want to write your mom a letter, or talk with her, just go to one of her favorite places, you can do that. And, if you just want to vent like you have here, do that. There's no time limit on grief and loss. There's no right way of doing it but the way you do. I hope this was helpful for you. You're not alone.",27
kchfc0,"AITA for not reporting a rapist TW : RAPE , pedophilia   So I was anally raped as a 6 year old . And didn’t realize it was rape until half way through grade 8. 3 years after the rape we moved to another country . We only visited my native country when I was 13. I had the opportunity to report him when I was 13, but I didn’t as I hadn’t really figured out it was rape yet or maybe I did and was in denial as I didn’t want to be a  “raped girl “. I just wanted to forget it , and never ever think about it . I am 16 now and feel so guilty about not reporting it . But the details are problematic . I was 6 and he was 12. He’s not gonna yet convixted for something he did then . But what if another girl reports , my report could have helped her be taken seriously . I went on an unpopular opinion thread and people said that rape victims who don’t report are enabling the rapist which only added on to my guilt . Also my mother has a tendency to blame sexual assault victims and I knew she’d ask why I didn’t tell her before. When I told her she didn’t handle it well AT ALL. She said I was stupid for not telling her sooner , except we don’t have a good relashionship. The ducking wall understands me better . Maybe even a shoe would understand me better . I doubt whether I could have handled that at 13. She also asked so many intrusive questions and wouldn’t stop probing . At 13, that would have tortured me . I feel like it’s my fault and I have some responsibility in his crimes to future victims. Even other rape victims on that thread shamed women for not reporting. I might report later on when we go back to my native country as i know my rape wasn’t my fault. Edit; my native country is India where the police don’t give a fuck. Even when I was 13, it’s 6 years since the incident , so they probably wouldn’t have believed me . I know one person who would give evidence but even so , he’s 12, they’re not gonna put him behind bars as he was a minor . Is that a valid reason to not accept responsibly , my power itself if very small. If I reported now they’d rip it up as there’s no real evidence . There’s one girl who might help, but that’s the only witness . So there’s such a tiny tiny chance that that could go well. Why would I bother taking it ? I think it’s near impossible for it to well . But there’s that one person who might support me .","You are not even slightly the AH.  First of all you are the victim, it is your choice if you report or not. The number one thing that rape councillors will say is that the victim needs to be in control of any report that is (or is not) done. You are not responsible for your rape, just like you are not responsible if they go onto rape someone else. You have no control over someone else's future actions.  Secondly you were 6 so it's ok that you had no way to explain what happened until years later. That's why a lot of child sexual assault is not reported until many years later.  If you want to report them now, you can do it. The police may not proceed with a prosecution, but at least it will go on that person's record if another accusation is made, however this is 100% your choice.  I would recommend that you see a therapist who specialises in child sexual assaults. They will help you to work through these feelings in guilt and help you decide if you did want to report (but again they shouldn't pressure you into doing so).  I am very sorry that you had to live through that and I hope that the person who did this to you is no longer someone that you have to deal with.",54

The fundamental idea of CBT is that Thoughts, Feelings and Actions are mutually affected by one another. So, if you act a certain way because you feel like it, you can learn to feel a certain way by acting like it.  So, based on the advice I was given, I would give you the same advice. Start small. Identify small, easy situations where you are by yourself and where you wish to be more expressive. This could be as simple as smiling at a rainbow because you are appreciative of its beauty. Start small like that, and make the expressions and emotions. Consciously tell yourself, ""That's nice."", or ""That makes me a bit happy."", or whatever your version of that is.  The key is to start small. When I tried it, I still had that asshole voice in my head going, ""Yeah, but you're faking it. It's not sincere. You're still a sociopathic weirdo."".

kjaybo,"I’ll try to keep this short.  Raised in an emotionally neglectful/distant home.  Parents probably tried their best, but their best wasn’t very good.  I was raised to be hyper-independent and to always control (read: repress) my emotions, take ownership of my thoughts, feelings, wants, needs, etc.  That got drilled into me especially hard as a ten-year-old when my parents had their second kid, and they told me my sibling would need a bunch of their time and I needed to be a “helper” by taking care of myself.  I did what they asked. From then on I withdrew and stopped asking for help unless I had no choice...they were always maxed out as people with “more important” things and I didn’t fight for their attention. But now as an adult I can’t seem to turn the emotional repression and “burden” concept off.  Emotional vulnerability and expressing deep-seated wants and needs with my spouse and close friends remains a real struggle.  Emotionally, I feel like I’m just burdening these people I care deeply about with my problems. I know on an intellectual level that these aren’t exactly burdens, but a form of bonding with others over shared struggles.  How do I get the rest of my heart and mind on the same page? My spouse is awesome and patient, and super supportive.  I want to give more of myself emotionally to our marriage but don’t even know how to re-wire these childhood traumas.  Anyone else been through something similar?  What worked for you? tl;dr How do I stop being so emotionally withdrawn so as not to burden close friends and spouse with my feelings and wants/needs?  How do I convince myself that my feelings matter?","Wow.. I actually just made a post where I talk partly about my experience with Childhood Emotional Neglect in this subreddit like 5 minutes before yours lmao. I’m still working on this myself. I’ve always been a people pleaser, putting everyone and everything else above myself, above my wants and needs to an unhealthy level where I’m putting my mental and physical health at risk. I tend to withdraw from my friends out of nowhere and I never really talk about myself. I never really cry in front of my friends, even my best friend of over half a decade. I don’t really share my feelings or issues or anything. Its always a subconscious thing for me to just always have my default on neglecting myself. I never think that what I’m going through is important or that it matters at all. I don’t want to burden anyone or bring the mood down or anything. And I never ask for help. I am always throwing myself under a bus and overwhelming myself to be the parent/therapist for everyone else. I treat people, to a much much more extreme extent to the way I wanted and needed to be treated as a child. I was neglected so I work over time to look after others. It’s a psychological thing that I only understand a little of. It’s taken me a long time to even become self-aware of the way I act or behave or treat myself. And there’s so much that I can’t even really put into words or explain honestly. It’s a tough road. It really is. I’m still figuring out how to start walking down the road. I’m trying to become more in touch with myself and with the moment. My disassociation is connected in a way to my CEN (Childhood Emotional Neglect). So, I have to work on grounding myself and staying present so time doesn’t just zoom by with me not really remembering. For me, (and this may or may not be what works for you), I realized that I have to work on getting to myself better and what’s really going on and get to the roots of everything and just spend time introspecting before I can start on trying to really work on actively trying methods of external things. (If that makes sense at all. My wording isn’t the best lol). I would maybe suggest doing a lot of research on CEN and maybe reaching out to others who experience the same issues (my DMs are always open) as to better understand yourself or maybe relate to something. Feeling less alone and connected to people who can somewhat understand can be very helpful.  I hope this helped at all. And again, my DMs are always open to anyone who wants to talk or vent or whatever. ❤️",29
kjofrz,"I have a bad relationship with my family and my therapist agrees it's not good for me to be around them (there's abuse going on). I had a partner for 5 years and we broke up in August and we went no contact, and my friends are scattered around the world. I am so lonely and all I want to do is cry. Everyone around seems so happy, with their families, their parteners, friends, their dinners, their songs, their presents. I know it has nothing to do with me but it almost feels like a mockery to see all these displays of affection, happiness and love during this time of the year and be so painfully alone.","No. This is a crappy year for a lot of us, and challenges have presented themselves anew seemingly every day. The easy answer is to check out, crawl into bed, and surrender. But this year, the culmination of which are spending the time of year expected to be spent with friends and family, alone, presents an opportunity for you to grow exponentially, to become stronger, more resilient, and more courageous.  If only one thing about life is true, it's this: life is suffering, maybe not all the time, but regularly and unavoidably. If you're not suffering now, you will be later, and however far you run or deeply you hide, hard times will always find you. It is better not to avoid the obstacle just because it is in your way. Rather, confront the thing head on.  Ask yourself four questions: * What do you want your life to look like right now? * What thoughts, feelings, emotions, or sensations are getting in the way of you getting to that life? * What do you do when you experience these thoughts, feelings, emotions, or sensations? * What can you do instead when you experience these thoughts, feelings, emotions, and sensations that will move you in the direction of what you want your life to look like? This year has sucked, and it's made even a basically acceptable quality of life a monumental endeavor. As is true with all things in life, though, those things that are worth doing, achieving, or having require real effort, intention, dedication, and sacrifice on our part in order to realize. We all have within us the ability to get where we want to be, as long as where we want to be is a reasonable goal. What separates us is whether or not we know what that goal is, and whether or not we're willing to work for it.  You can do this. Find that deeper strength.",61
kk5fx1,so my dad is in town for christmas for the first time since i was a young kid. i was so excited to spend time with him and my siblings. then my sister told me that my step brother (who they all know molested me on multiple occasions when i was a teen) was coming as a christmas surprise for my dad. none of them take the situation seriously and claim they “believe us both” which makes no sense. my step brother crosby never admitted what he did to me and my family did nothing about it when i told them years ago. now they’re all pressuring me to come to christmas for my dads sake because he came all this way. i don’t want to go and i want them to understand how fucked up it is they invited him or have a relationship with him at all. no one ever cares or listens to me then i end up being the bad guy because i don’t attend family functions. any advice would be appreciated because i am so lost and don’t know what to do. i don’t want to lose my family but i don’t feel like they can truly love me and simultaneously support him.,"This situation is called ""victim blaming"". It happened to me when I was being bulied in high school for years. They always blamed me even when things were obvious. Thats ""victim blaming"".

I started resisting and he stopped eventually but I still have some leftover fears that doesn’t allow me to live normally. I want to talk to my therapist about it but I don’t want CPS called since my dad has stopped. He never did it to intentionally hurt me but he thought he was entitled to it. Do you think my therapist would call CPS on my dad even after all this time (a year)? If so, what should I do to help myself and live normally again without talking to one?","Just because your dad has stopped doing it, it doesn't mean he does not deserve to feel the consequences for his actions.

kl22ry,"Just to be clear, I’m not looking for any sort of attention or pep talk. I just want to know why this happens and if there is a way I can stop it.  I am a third year college student. I participate in the theatre, so I am often working one-on-one with people on my singing, acting, or dancing. I have won regional-level awards, so I know that I am not bad at what I do. But still, I am horribly self-conscious. My professors are very aware and understanding of this.  Sometimes, when I come in for a lesson, my professor will say something as simple as “are you alright?” and I break into tears.  Similarly, when I’m down on myself, a professor or mentor will say very nice things about how talented I am. I inevitably break down crying. One time, my mentor insisted that I say something nice about myself and I just couldn’t. I felt as though I couldn’t allow myself that, or that it was embarrassing, or something.  I am diagnosed with depression and am currently medicated, have been for a while. I go through sad periods of lack of motivation and general sadness, but I have these crying fits invariably when someone sincerely compliments me.  For background (not sure if any of this is relevant), I’ve always been a straight-A overachiever student. My parents believe in me and are generally alright, but they are traditional and expect compliance and perfect children.  Why can’t I let other people be nice to me, and why can’t I be nice to myself? Is there a way I can keep myself from crying in professional situations in which I really need to not be crying?",Not a therapist but you're probably not used to people being kind to you and appreciating you for your achievements.    It should have been your parents job but they possibly just expected it from you so you never got the appreciation you needed and deserved. Also seems like you might be a little hard on yourself.,49
klkt20,"This morning at 5am my husband I've been with for 8y two of them married, had a seizure for the first time out of no where. I'm 25 he's 27. He convulsed for a few minutes and then stopped breathing for almost 2 minutes. I know you're not supposed to do cpr on someone seizing but he wasn't moving or breathing for what felt like an eternity after convulsing, I thought I lost him and I dicided to give him cpr. I've been certified before in the past. After trying my best he started coughing up all this phlem and began to breath again. Later on after he arrived at the hospital he had another seizure. The doctors weren't really telling me much over the phone all day and I wasn't allowed to go because of covid. I've had to deal with hospitals a lot before growing up with an autoimmune disease and both of my sister's have had extremely rare life threatening autoimmune diseases. I found out it was caused by alcohol withdrawal. He never showed any signs of being that severe of a drinker, I knew he drank but what I was told was way more than I ever thought by the doctor. I've been around alcoholics all my life working at bars and living with roommates, my husband never acted or showed the signs or even a warning this would happen. I was trying to ask what I could do afterwards to help him when he is able to leave in a few days and it broke my heart when the doctor told me I probably couldn't afford rehab and also said that I probably wouldn't find any aa programs. What am I supposed to do?  How can our system of health care be so messed up. This country doesn't care about it's people. What if he just sneaks alcohol and dies this time because I couldn't help him or get him help? Do they just want me to watch him drink himself to death?

kom1ni,"I first started therapy after a suicide attempt. I later found out that I was also dealing with undiagnosed mental illness but that has little to do with the story now.  I spent a big part of my therapy time subconsciously acting like I knew all the answers which did not help at all. I finally found an excellent therapist a year ago and I began to feel okay not having answers to things and not trying to rationalise everything. Therapy truly began to feel like a safe space where I wasn't trying to hide anything. I also grew a lot as an individual and it became easier identifying the problems I had and where they began. My tramus began with my toxic family. Growing up with them made me normalise a lot of unhealthy habits which lead me into unhealthy and abusive relationship as an adult. I also picked up on toxic habits along the way that I didn't see as wrong. I'm finally at a stage where everything is clear and I am not trying to make excuses for myself or people. I have accepted the fact that nothing will change how my family is, I've become indifferent to them and it feels good not hoping that they will be better just to be disappointed. My inner child is healing and I'm taking active steps to be a better adult. It feels good to breathe again","This gives me a hoping kind of feeling. My first therapist told me there was a rule where I couldn’t say, “I don’t know.” I had to have an answer. I’ve long ago realized this wasn’t a great therapy approach but hearing your story gives me hope. Thanks for sharing ☺️",7
koyfxp,"It has always been a challenge to communicate with my parents, part of it is because I am no longer fluent in my Vietnamese. The other reason is because growing up we never talked about our feelings and emotions. I grew up in a unstable household, my parents were always arguing and eventually got a divorce 10 years ago. Sill not mutual, they can’t even be in the same room together. Ever since then, my dad has just gone downhill. His debt is out of control and mental health is deteriorating. There aren’t many Vietnamese therapists in my area, a lot of the Asian community don’t believe in therapy and mental health.  We also don’t have the money to pay hundreds of dollars per session, I believe some therapists take insurance. But I’m lost with how to approach this.","I’m sorry about what’s happening to you.

kp72pb,"The people talking hardly, if at all, make eye contact with you, and talk over you when you try to add to the conversation. & / or when you do say something, it’s sometimes met with no response.  Any one have insight on why this happens?","I find it difficult to discuss what I discovered for myself regarding this because my experience might not be yours. Personally, it was a confidence and independence issue. People were not actively including me with eye contact and direct questions of comments to me. They would interrupt and talk over me. And I felt like an outsider for a long time in these types of situations. I sat myself down and committed to a few things:  1) Stop taking it personally. Other people exercising a lower standard of inclusion is their character flaw, not mine.  2) Be you for you. Participate in the conversations you want to participate in the way you want to regardless of who is listening or not listening.  3) Pick your friends. In other words, if I am hanging with these folks, it’s because I want to hang with them, not because I think they want to hang with me.  4) Accept nature. In other words, let relationships strengthen or weaken naturally, focusing on being a healthy friend to myself and others. When I made these commitments, I could not keep them.

I love you and I hope you do reach out to me whoever you are goodbye,"This is a bad decision, at least doing so on this sub. Look, as anybody who’s depressed, anxious, or has any other similar mental health disorder will tell you, regular people _really_ don’t understand what they’re getting into when they try to be this person for people suffering from mental illness. Eventually you’ll get sick of the venting - that’s not a commentary on how shallow you are or something, that’s how mental illness _works_ a lot of the time, and the overwhelming majority of people on this sub are here specifically because they suffer from some sort of mental disorder. Things like that are irrational, they’re cognitive distortions, and they often never stop. You will get sick of people constantly complaining about how people always talk about how they hate themselves, how they’re paranoid that everyone hates them, how every little stupid irrational thing frightens them; that’s what “venting” is to people like us. That’s how it often is for people like us, _all the time,_ and someone who _doesn’t_ experience that can likely acknowledge the irrationality of such thoughts a _lot_ easier than the person experiencing them, and eventually, it’s going to become tiring going through a lot of those same motions over and over again, because that’s what mental illness _does,_ it fucks with your sense of rationality, and places an exaggerated importance on things which are considered insignificant to those who are neurotypical. That’s the kind of thing someone in your position would be hearing from us _constantly,_ and when you eventually decide that it’s getting too negative and depressing for you to handle ( which I want to make clear, is perfectly reasonable ), you leaving them as a source of support will often contribute to their mental illness even more. What I’m saying is, don’t make yourself a social martyr for people like us. While support is always appreciated, it’s a lot to handle when you’re essentially saying you’ll be their crutch, and you don’t realize it yet, but you have limits in that regard as well, and you’re not going to notice it until you hit it. The fact that you say you’re not one to throw “pity parties” doesn’t help either, since unfortunately, that’s a _lot_ of what it sounds like from anybody experiencing intrusive thought or negative cognitive distortions - that’s how those things often work. You’re ( presumably ) _not_ a mental health professional, and unless you are, it’s not a good idea to put yourself in a position where a person suffering from mental illness will become heavily reliant on you, a total stranger, for their mental health. To be clear, the sentiment is _very_ appreciated, but it _isn’t_ sustainable for most people.",73
kqtxav,"Today I told my therapist that I'm feeling I'm suicidal bc of Covid isolation and financial problems, and he responded by drinking straight out of a of a bottle of wine on camera, and eating cookies.

I didn't know what to say so I told him I thought I was tired of his attitude and that maybe we should meet less often, he didn't seem to care. I was too passive; I feel I should have probably just confronted him more directly, but honestly I'm not in a good space to be confront my therapist right now! For months I've been noticing that my therapist hasn't been on top of things, increasingly phoning-in our sessions. He says he's sorry a lot, and has no consistent plan for our sessions. He's missed sessions before because of ""helping a hung over roommate"".  I don't know how I should respond. I get this services free through low income county assistance, so no cost to me. I think I should stop seeing him, but I'm on the fence about reporting him to his boss.","You've gotta report him. It hurts, and it sucks, and hopefully he'll get a reprimand and smarten up.

ktjyu8,"Essentially I [19M]don’t want to go to college, Uni seems fun at first but its definitely not for me realistically and long term. I honestly just want to go to get a degree in animation and get out. Is there something for people like that? I heard of something called an accelerated bachelors degree or something and perhaps something online specifically. I basically wanna do something that takes as little time as possible and is relatively not so expensive that it’ll put me and my family in debt forever ten fold. I’d be down to go to school purely for animation and nothing else if it meant in 1 to 2 years i’d get a degree, because I don’t think i could handle 4 to 6 to 8 years of that. Also the actual rant incoming: Essentially COVID fucked me and many 2020 kids over. I never really got to properly have that last day of school or real graduation, just a degree in the mail, never got to say goodbye to any of my friends either. The day ended like any average day in march and that was that, if i knew that was essentially the last day of my youth as kinda kid /late teen I would’ve done so much more man. I was the type to skip lunch with friends to just study and work for tests that i never ended up taking. It’s so fucked up how took it all for granted and put so much time into school instead of cherishing those fleeting moments. I know these are feelings one goes through regardless of covid or not but for us 2020 kids especially, a lot of us never really got that closure of properly saying goodbye and transitioning into adulthood. Mentally i feel like i’m still that 18 year old kid back in march. I don’t feel like an adult at all, and everyone dumping all these adult responsibilities and pressures on me are freaking me the hell out. Seeing my closest friends growing distant and getting into colleges and moving out is just killing me man... A part of me wishes things were better, another wants things to change and wish they were different, another part of me just wants everything to stay the same forever and its conflicting af. I miss everyone, even though i’ve been so productive as of late....that summer of 2019 was probably the last time i was truly happy and I don’t think I appreciate that feeling enough. There are fleeting moments of motivation and joy here and there and i know I gotta keep moving forward, when this stuff is reminded to me again, i feel all kinds of hurt again. I’m not the type to get suicidal and I definitely won’t cry or kill myself over this, but this pit I’m feeling really just makes me want to go somewhere far away and just retreat to a bubble all my own and spend my time they’re drawing and enjoying the luxuries of life until the isolation suffocates and crushes me in it til i just fade away and die. Anyone know what to do about this, or at least any idea of how i’m feeling? TL;DR Don’t wanna go to college the traditional way but still wanna get a degree relatively fast and for cheap. I’m also overwhelmed and stressed af at how fast time is moving and how i feel both old and jaded and young af and don’t know how to cope with my steadily changing life. Its hard to talk about these things with older adults a lot cause most don’t know the feeling of just never getting that closure that came with graduating and that last day of school, so they just tell me dismissively and laugh it off that i’ll get over it and it doesn’t matter. Of course i’ll get over it someday, but how? And this moment leaves me feeling so sour, i know in the grand scale its a trivial problem but to me it means everything. Obviously i’ll keep moving forward, but I genuinely don’t know what to do to actually resolve any of these problems in a healthy way.","You are grieving the life you didn't get. You are right to be sad about how your high school life ended.

Your family would have been proud to mark the day and you would have shared these memories with friends. Making you feel closer to them. And in these crazy, scary confusing times you were denied all of that. It was not your fault. And it's OK to grieve for what you have lost.

ktufok,"(In the US)  .. Is the system that bad? I have been trying on and off for months to find something local (I live in a very populated suburban area).  I do have insurance. It seems like there are a handful of sites containing lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, social workers, etc and these professionals are all shots in the dark.  You call them, most of the time they don't have any openings despite being listed as having openings.   When I do call, I feel like I have really no clue if I'm choosing an appropriate professional. Seems like if you don't already have a referral from someone trusted,  then you really know extremely little about the choice you're making, there's not much informational available. It would be so advantageous, considering the mental distress and hopelessness that some feel when they are searching for a professional, if there were just a service where someone could work with you to help you with a referral or to connect you with a curated list of professionals with availability who are suggested to be appropriate for you.  I haven't found anything like this however.  Maybe I am being unfair, I'm mostly venting I suppose.  But if anyone has any words of wisdom I am all ears.","Keep trying.  I agree, it’s completely ridiculous. I had to look for 3 months before I finally found someone who 1) accepted my insurance (for some reason the list of clinicians MY insurance company sent me, suddenly no longer accepted that insurance?) and 2) had open availability.

He has almost died before, came out on the other side and ever since then has lived every day as if it was his last. I had so much respect for the man and the rapport between us was something I'd never felt before. I was so comfortable around him and could discuss anything I needed to. He was the first therapist to correctly diagnose me with Bipolar II. He listened, he cared, and during your session you were his main priority. We had discussed going to 1 session every 2 weeks in the new year due to my progression. That progression would never have happened without his support and compassion. He will always have a place in my heart and I know that with the tools he gave me, I'll be able to continue my progression. I have no idea how to mourn (even though I’ve lost people in the past) and especially not for someone who helped me through my life every week for the past year. I understand that therapy isn’t forever but now I feel lost and I’m not sure what to do. I feel like I’m drowning and struggling to keep my head above water on some of the easiest things in life... any help and suggestions are really appreciated  Thank you","I’m so sorry for your loss. The therapist-client relationship is unique from any other kind of relationship but that does not mean your grief is not 100% valid. please be kind to yourself during this time, as much as you can. your therapist sounded like a great person.",42
kvili3,"I have been realizing lately that I seem to get so upset in sessions I end up zoning out, forgetting or just not hearing what therapist is saying. It is upsetting and I am not sure why this happens. Is there anyway to prevent this? Does anyone else experience this. It is like I unconsciously detach somehow?","Yes, this is dissociation",61
kw3c7l,"I couldn't even believe my ears when I heard the therapist say this during their FIRST SESSION WITH ME THIS MORNING. It took all the energy I had this morning to make a cup of coffee and make myself presentable for Zoom before I had to head off to work. I know I'll be seeking another therapist but I just feel like crap and her words actually made me sick to my stomach. I do case management for people with addiction and I started around 2.5 months ago and I'm still struggling to keep up. I want to love my job so much (and I do have some amazing clients who make my job so much easier!) but I'm still struggling and depressed. I do dread work sometimes. I work with clients who are deep into their addiction and see me as a barrier in their lives. I never know what to say. I wasn't trained well for this job and was kind of given a packet of instructions and left to my own devices with a ""just let me know if you have any questions!"" ugh. It takes everything in me to not procrastinate at work and my job is crazy stressful. I feel like my brain is foggy but at the same time like a frozen internet browser with 50 tabs open. I struggle to wake up at a normal time each morning, I struggle to call and talk to clients on the phone. All of my old coworkers have quit and I am all by myself most days. I worry about my parents because I don't have siblings. I worry all the time about helping them even though my dad is still emotionally abusive towards me and I'm 27. I cried all day yesterday about my almost 12-year-old dog who is having breathing problems. I almost started crying again when I woke up this morning. When I get home, housework goes to the side. I can't even bring myself to do it on the weekends. my room is a mess, I have clothes everywhere. I impulse buy and I'm broke all the time. I don't know wtf is wrong with me.",I work in addiction medicine. It’s not for the fault of heart. A lot of us in my department have our own therapists because we deal with the trauma losing patients on a regular basis. It’s not for everyone and I would not fault you if you decided it’s not for you.  It also sounds like you are struggling with depression. I know exactly what it feels like when you can barely get out of bed. It’s not laziness hun. Your therapist sucks.,33
kwjbir,From the “Ten Percent Happier” podcast; Episode 309.,"It's probably impossible for some but it's life saving to accept that there's this self-esteem muscle that you oughta strengthen. Try to remove fear of being low value, low perf.. it's not equating you not being good enough or lovable. It can remove a lot of pain in your daily life, change how you approach others (you're not afraid of your flaws, and not focused on you, you're free to have fun or find friends again). Not easy even after realizing that but I believe it's true.",2
kxba30,"TW Today, in therapy session, I said, ""why can't I just die today and end all this pain and suffering."" My therapist was quite and then asked me, ""have you seen game of thrones?"" I said, ""yes""  She then says, ""what do we say to death?"" I replied, ""not today"" :'')","i know you didn't ask, so i pre-apologize, but something that helps me when im feeling this way is a similar kind of sassy but real moment (imo). ""the universe doesn't create anything it doesn't need."" literally speaking. no matter is created, nor destroyed. so the universe doesn't create anything it doesn't need, humans might, but the universe doesn't. so whether we like it or not, the universe decided it needed \*you\* and im so glad you're here. wishing you better, softer, more fun days <3",58

l0nuou,"Sorry for the bad English in advance. I thought i'd share because I'm so happy and it might help others.  I was in therapy for 5 years. It was a lady in her late 60's and she charged me less than a third of what the average cost of a session would be in my country at the time for the same amount of time. She was of very little help if not none. It was the same as talking to a friend, she would give me some advise but in the long run it wasn't helpful at all. Also as she was old and I went between the ages of 14 to 19, I needed to explain a lot of things related to social media and new generation stuff. And the worst part was, she used to fall asleep!!!!! Back then I thought that what I was going through wasn't that important and I just bored her.  Short before I turned 20 I realized I needed a change. I was going through a very strong depression and I decided to go to a psychiatrist because I thought I needed ""a bigger help"" since therapy wasn't working. That was when I found out what therapy is really about. I'm currently on psychiatric treatment and she recommended me another psychologist. Today I had my second session and I can tell you that it has already helped me way more than those 5 years with that old lady. I can't be more thankful with my psychiatrist and psychologist because I'm learning a lot and I'm finally finding a way to better myself.  Don't be afraid to find a new therapist. If they're not helping you you can and should find a new one.",This is such a good post! I was in therapy for a year and then moved so couldn’t see that therapist any more. When I found a new therapist I realised that nothing happened in that one year because she was useless. You have to try a few sometimes.,15
l10sey,"I know that it’s unlikely anyone would be listening in but for some reason, I just can’t bring myself to do my first session from my room while other people are in the room right next to mine... makes it much harder for me to be open if I suspect someone can hear Me.

l168d7,"I have been friends (and neighbors) with my closest friend for pretty much my whole life. We have grown up together and she's pretty much a sister to me.  But recently she's been going through quite a bit of shit in her life. Depression, anxiety, a concision, anorexia, family problems the list goes on. She's been going to A LOT of doctor appointments, been on many different meds, trying to find something to help her. I'm always trying to support her, we talk about things to eachother and I know things have been hard.  But most recently her eating disorder has been really bad, like really really bad. I hear my other friends saying she looks so good and hot and all I see is the fact that she hasn't eaten in days. The other week she went to get an ECG, I'm not exactly what for but her results came back not looking to great. She has a pretty low heart rate from her reduction of calories over a long period of time. Her doctor told her that there's a risk or heart attack.  Her doctor gave her different options to try and help her and she has declined them all. Refusing help until she hits ""rock bottom"" which for her is when she's in the hospital. Hearing this has pretty much destroyed me. I try my best to be there for her and support her in all the way I possibly can, but I literally can even look at her without wanting to cry. I continuously picture going to her funeral or sitting beside her watching a movie and she has a heart attack. The thought of her dying will break me in so many ways I wouldn't know what to do with myself.  She's very stubborn and won't listen to anything anyone else has to say, I don't know how to help her and I don't even know if I can.  I know telling this to some random people on Reddit won't fix anything but I need to get this off my chest and the only people in my life that I've told barley even responded to what I was telling them. I just don't know what to do and I cant lose her, I just can't do it. Edit: I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub to post this in but I couldn't think of any other to say this in.","I am so sorry you have to go through this, you must be feeling helpless, I was suicidal once, my advice would be to love her unconditionally. She is unable to love herself. But there is one catch though, you can't be responsible for her, her actions, whatever happens to her, you're not responsible. So the minute it affects your mental health, you gotta take a break. All the best, hope it helps. ",30
l1mhi2,"Long story short, my husband of 12 years at the time left me 10 months ago, our divorce finalized 6 months ago. I have random thoughts from the first couple of weeks and months written down in a journal that I made the mistake of going back through and reading and it hurts all over again. I never wanted the divorce but I am glad we’re apart now because hindsight has shown me a life I didn’t want to continue, but I am so sad and crying right now and I don’t want these feelings? What do I do to make it stop? Is time really the only thing?","I've been seeing a trauma therapist for the better part of a year now. I want to let you know that your emotions belong because they are part of you and you belong. They deserve your attention because they are part of you and you deserve to be honored and seen. Your difficult emotions have a job and they will pass and they will ease. If you disassociate from them or repress them you can actually shut yourself off to all emotions, even the ones you do want to feel. It's not your fault if this happens, it's the body's natural response trying to protect you, it just doesn't know how to tell the difference between those emotions. I know you're in the middle of it so this may sound like stupid advice. Meditation has really helped me, I am currently separated from my wife of 15 years, we have seven children together who are with me pretty much all the time. When trying to apply what I'm learning from my therapist to our children I actually use the Disney Pixar movie Inside Out. We use the characters to help identify which emotion we are dealing with. Lately it has been a mixture of fear, sadness and anger. But once you can name them you can begin to accept them. Your emotions are not bad and you are not bad for having them. It means that you are a full human being because to be fully human means to have emotions. What you're going through is traumatic, and if you don't have a therapist this specializes in trauma I would highly recommend it. It's okay if you don't know how to handle these difficult emotions, I just turned 37 last week and I did not know how to handle difficult emotions until I started therapy this past year. Don't beat yourself up for not having the tools to handle this. The good news is you can learn, you can grow, you can be healthy and whole again! Praying and wishing and sending peace your way tonight",48
l25ifv,"My husband and I are going through a divorce. We have been seeing our therapist for almost 3 years but in December decided to divorce. We have two young boys and I was talking today about how my three year old is always excited to see me but my one year old looks at me like who the hell are you? They live with their dad/stay at his mom’s a lot. Anyway, I had never seen my therapist cry before and she broke down a little as I was talking about this and she just said how sad she is for us and our kids. I have been pondering/decided a few months ago that once I’m stable enough to go get my grad degree I want to become a therapist. For her to show emotion like that - I dunno it just made me feel like she really cares about us. I was also thinking I’m such an empathic person I always worried I would get too emotional when clients share intimate things with me. Just thought I would share/ask how you would feel about this. I wanted to post on the other sub but only therapists are allowed to post there.","My therapist started to tear up when i found out I got my first ever job (got the phone call during a session). (I have severe anxiety and working is one of my biggest anxieties) I don’t think there’s any problem with it, despite being therapists they are still human and like you said it shows that they care. I think there is a line though, like a therapist sobbing hysterically over something a client said wouldn’t be appropriate.",74
l2tin3,"Most social media platforms are toxic and unrealistic but TikTok is so addictive because the content displayed is based on an algorithm that matches your interests, personality traits, aspirations, etc. Unrealistic lifestyles, body goals and expectations are shoved into people's faces every day and while it can motivate some people and give an opportunity for small businesses to grow, most of the time it just leads to disappointment and dissatisfaction with the self. People give themselves unreachable goals, fail to achieve it and then go back to TikTok for comfort because they vicariously achieve it through others. But what people fail to understand is that those individuals don't even live like that, that is purely a facade; skinny girls starve themselves, studious people are the biggest messes, people who laugh, cry themselves to sleep and people with loads of friends chat rubbish about their 'friends' behind their backs. This toxic cycle will continue if you don't actively break it yourself and live your life imperfectly unapologetically.",I never used tiktok; seems like something for lil teenagers. Although my friends in their late twenties/early thirties use it too. I can’t imagine a more toxic social media app than Instagram though.,23
l3aj77,"I use to be extremely emotional, always. But ever since my break up and all the thoughts it’s left me with, I feel like a rock.","Yes! It is so normal to feel numb while you are sorting through trauma and recalling the events. It's a protective measure that occurs naturally, do not worry about it. It's okay to let it be numb for awhile. You need to recover from that overly stressful exertion that is your breakup. Don't push yourself to feel again, it can make you more reactive in the future. You should also avoid shaming emotions (or lack of) around trauma as well. You are taking care of yourself.  Breakups are awful. They can really fuck a person up. When you are ready: somethings that helped me through my last one was making bad art (so you can throw it away when you are done) and journaling.",35

I laid there for almost an hour and could not think of one thing that I like about myself in either the past or the present.  I'm not really sure what to do with this information, besides I guess try to not suck so much. Wish me luck?","That is an awesome and helpful, healthy epiphany.

l5zxt0,"But I can always see it from the corner of my eye. No complaints here, just a funny observation.  If any therapists are reading this, it’s cool to just drink your water, coffee, whatever. Also, when we’re looking away from the screen we can usually still register and decode movement.",Lol thank you for saying this!

l6ekp7,"What are some good questions or ways to help people open up and process their emotions? I'm looking for beyond just validation, asking how they feel, summarizing, etc. Are there questions or techniques to get people to comprehend their emotions or help them open up/process about what they're feeling? Which ones do you find yourself asking or how do you approach working with emotions?","Talking about the core emotions in DBT using the movie Inside Out makes it feel so much more relatable, especially to teens (I explain why I think Surprise isn’t in there). I like to talk about action urges, how natural it is to react unproductively (back to barbaric days), and the importance of containment, not suppression, but containment according to your audience/environment at the time.  I think talking about how they also want to present to the world with who they are vs the emotions they live in is also helpful in explaining opposite action. I always want my clients to be proud of themselves when they walk away from an interaction.  I also use lots of examples. Questions...  Are you proud of how you responded?  What would it be like if someone had treated you that way?  What was underneath the emotion (usually anger) when you yelled? -usually I focus on protective factors of what emotions can do and how reactivity is usually out of protection.  I also focus on their intent and the intent of the person they were responding or reacting to.  I LOVE working with emotions and also reiterate that seniors in their 90’s may have never learned how to manage them, so keep compassion there.",18
l74y3l,"I had therapy this morning. I was prepared. I wrote an entire list of topics to cover. I had journal entries that I wanted to read. I planned to tell her about my hopelessness and self harm(which I HAVE talked to her about before) I made her aware of that and she was so supportive...however I sat there giggling and talking about random stuff and unable to communicate  the entire time. I’m honestly disgusted with myself. I wasted money and her time. I sat there in basically silence and used small talk and just could not make myself communicate with her even though I so wanted to. She’s such an amazing therapist...kind, supportive, funny..and I trust her entirely. However recently I just freeze up almost and it’s almost as though I look at my list and something in my mind prevents me from saying any of the stuff out loud. I was so angry at myself that directly after the session I self harmed again. Now I’m going to have to wait until our next session which is Monday.","I can absolutely relate. I'm sorry you're having a rough time, but try to tell your T about this, maybe she can help! Alot of therapists are aware of this issue. Personally, I constantly block up and completely forget what i wanted to say in therapy. Sometimes I just can't get myself to read what I wrote down because it all feels stupid and insignificant.

One where I have friends and someone who loves me. Where I’m actually living happily and I can make my parents proud. I’ll be daydreaming one minute and then sad crushing weight of reality hits and I’m actually alone in my room. Pretending that i can be happy. I just want to make my parents proud. Whether I either become successful in my career or I work a 9-5 but I’d still make them proud. I mean they say they are but how do I believe them when I’m nowhere in life?

I’ve never had a good birthday and it looks like it’s gonna be the same this year.,"first off, you are HUMAN and you are WORTHY as you are. as much as you wished you felt more accomplished and fulfilled, those feelings do not take away from the fact that you are worth it as you are; just being. no amount of self-deprecating, hopeless thoughts will be able to make a difference to your inherent worth. it is not tied to anything external. life is made difficult when you don’t acknowledge your worth. i do understand how you feel. i havent experienced exactly what you have, but i am very hard on myself with academics and i struggle with anxiety also. it’s easy to let your achievements [or lack thereof] define you, and consequently dangerous and not good for the mind. it’s quite ironic in that sense, because knowing one’s worth and having confidence is likely to assist in school and work. it is helpful in all areas of life.",31
l8a7cr,"2020 was a lot. A lot of growth and a lot of changes but grateful nonetheless.  1.) moved out in March 2020 and living by myself (27/F). This is the first time me living on my own, no family members and no roommates. 2.) came out officially to friends and my mom after many years of suppressing my sexuality without telling a soul (except Reddit). Positive and supportive reactions from all.  3.) a lot of dating, a lot of firsts with women, and a lot of rejections. Possibly could be burned out by dating. I had this naive notion that once I came out everything would be smooth sailing from here. I’ll somehow find the love of my life but dating has been rough.  2020 was not a bad year for me, it was a lot of my stepping outside of my comfort zone but for some reason I still feel sad and alone. It goes in waves, there are some moments when I’m happy as fuck and then there are moments where I’m just sad and empty inside. I have been having random crying spells and anxiety.  I used to smoke every other day before bed but now smoking gets me paranoid or gives me anxiety and sometimes makes me cry.  I really would like to get into therapy but sometimes I feel a bit ridiculous for going to therapy. My life isn’t bad. I have a good job, good friends, supportive family, and yet I still feel alone. Maybe it’s dating... maybe it’s my love life that is making me feel sad.","I’m sorry you’re going through this! Good for you for all that you’ve accomplished this year. Getting outside of your comfort zone is huge!  Tbh dating is really hard these days for everyone. It’s our generation, people are so noncommittal because of the apps and stuff, everyone has the fear of better options. Times have changed and everyone I know has been experiencing difficulties in that area. I hope that this helps you understand that it’s not about you, but that the general population is experiencing the same issues. It’s exhausting and I don’t blame you at all for this causing you sadness. As far as the crying spells randomly, I feel like that’s a normal reaction to the hardships you’re going through. It’s good that you’re letting yourself cry and get those emotions out because a lot of people hold them in and then it causes more problems down the road. You could have a mild case of depression, but the only way to know for sure is to see a therapist. Going to therapy doesn’t make you ridiculous at all. It shows a lot of strength to be able to go to therapy, it’s difficult and emotional, but the long term benefits are so worth it. Give it a shot, it could really help you heal.",21
l8s13o,"After paying over $1k for a subscription-based online therapy service over the last 6 months, I cancelled my account before it renewed today. I sent one text a month on average, and they responded the same way every time saying ""and what symptoms are effecting you the most"" which left me frozen. They increased the rate from 160 to 180 (don't remember if they notified me, as I've been in a well of depression for as long). Should I ask for a refund? Edit: I requested a refund and the company honored that. Just because online therapy didn’t work for me at this point doesn’t mean it’s not valuable or that I won’t try again in the future.  This is a huge weight of my chest financially, but now it’s time to move forward with a different plan and follow through with finding a local therapist.","You could certainly try. Just curious as to why you only sent one message a month? Im not familiar with any of the subscription based online services, is this part of a package?

l9kc99,"Long story short, When me (24m) and my gf (26f) started dating a few months ago, the first time we had sex, after first starting with a condom, I asked if she’d want to have sex without a condom. She asked me if had done an STD test recently. I said I did one a few months prior and it came back negative. Then she asked me if I had had unprotected sex after that test. I told her no. That was a lie. I did. I slept with a girl a few times after doing the test and before meeting my now-girlfriend.  When I told her no I didn’t think it was a big deal. I tested negative and had only slept with one person after that who I trust, so to me it seemed like it wasn’t a big deal to just say I hadn’t slept with anyone after the test. A few weeks ago I read there’s such a thing as “rape by deception” ie lying or hiding information which makes consent invalid. Suddenly I realized that she probably wouldn’t have consented to sex without the condom if I told her the truth. Ever since that realization a few weeks ago I haven’t been able to sleep, I can’t think of anything else literally and I feel like a monster. I can’t look my gf in the eyes anymore. Where do I go from here? To start, yes I have done another STD test which also came back negative so it’s not like I gave her anything and we’re safe, but I have no clue how to deal with this guilt. I don’t know if I should tell her, or whether that may traumatize her. I don’t know if I even deserve forgiveness for this. Any advise is welcome please","It may be helpful to consider that shame (""Ever since that realization a few weeks ago I haven’t been able to sleep, I can’t think of anything else literally and I feel like a monster."", ""I don’t know if I should tell her, or whether that may traumatize her. I don’t know if I even deserve forgiveness for this."") Gets in the way of accountability.  It sounds like you want to be accountable and move forward. It sounds like you want to tell her what happened.  Remember,  that if you do,  you want it to be about HER, not your shame.  Otherwise,  you may be still pushing her into a position of being emotionally responsible (i.e. assuring you that you are not a monster) even if that's not your intent.  What do you think you can do to take full accountability?",252
la4jqd,"Do you ever just really want to have sex? You’re horny, but not necessarily for the sex but for the intimacy. I want someone to touch me. I want a guy who loves me enough to break through the walls I built up and kiss me, and make me feel vulnerable. So vulnerable that I could take off all my clothes and show him all my insecurities, all the things I hate about myself and my body... and for him to look at it and smile and love it. I wish someone could love my body the way I’m supposed to. I wish someone appreciated it cause I don’t. I wish I didn’t feel ashamed about my body, I know I can’t love it so is it too much to ask of someone else to love it? I’ve thought about trying to do an onlyfans or something like so, so maybe there would be someone who would say they find me attractive but it makes me feel bad. I don’t want to be sexualised I just want someone to love my body. Does that make sense?","What you want makes a lot of sense. My advice is to focus less on your body and more on yourself as an individual. What you want can’t simply be achieved by being physically beautiful. The intimacy you want stems from a person knowing your soul as well.  A challenge you may need to overcome is learning to love yourself. This doesn’t mean being conceited or aloof, this simply means understanding who you are and being at peace with yourself. If there is something you don’t like about yourself (and I’m not talking about your body here) then ask yourself how you could improve that part of you. But don’t take this as me saying you have to be perfect. I know I am not perfect and I make plenty of mistakes, but I try my best to mend my mistakes and move on.  I don’t know how old you are, but I’d you’re a teen, you may run into the issue that a lot of other people just want sex. Don’t build a relationship off of sex. You will end up meeting someone who you can talk to. You will be able to show them who you are as a person. They will see you (both your body and soul) as beautiful. A person who loves your soul will also love your body. They will want you. That intimacy comes from pure love for oneself and each other.  I wouldn’t create an only fans because those people are only there for your body. While you could show them your body, you wouldn’t be able to show them your insecurities because they only know your body. My advice is to work towards loving yourself and waiting for the right person. The right person will show up eventually, and the wait is worth it. That person will love all of you, and that love is well worth the wait.  I hope this helps because I’m not that good at giving therapy over text, nor am I a therapist. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask, I’m happy to help!",22
laurql,"I have had my current therapist for about a year and a couple of weeks ago I realized that she never really helped me solve any problems. So I looked for a new therapist and planned on switching. Then last week for the first time we managed to actually work on one of my problems. She asked me how I felt about it and made concrete suggestions on how to procede and I though that was good. Just now I was making coffee and it suddenly hit me: she was just helping herself. The problem we worked on was my fear about spending money. Basically for the last decade I was always on the brink of having nothing. I was in debt, struggled to pay my bills and grocery shopping became hard to impossible around the 20th of every month. Now I'm a litlle bit better of, but I am still afraid to spent more than I absolutely have to. That includes buying a webcam for video therapy sessions. My therapist already told me that she would not be able to get paid by my insurance for phone therapy for much longer. Essentially, if I don't buy that webcam, she will have a financial loss because of it. I just realized that this is the reasson she was suddenly willing and able to actually work on a problem with me. Usually she says stuff like: that's part of your diagnosis, you will have acccept that, many people feel like that etc. Basically cheap excuses for not working on the problem, or even on working on me comming to terms with a problem that can't be solved. I'm pretty pissed right now about wasting a year of therapy on the selfish, useless.... let's just say person. I will be talking to my insurance provider about switching therapists and I will confront my therapist about why she suddenly can help me, just when she would be affected by not doing so. I will also look into reporting her, allthough I am unsure if that is even possible. Maybe it's just in my mind that a doctor who refuses to help patients, but just strings them along to get paid by their insurance is a fraud. Thanks for comming to my rant, may your daily epiphany be less frustrating than mine.","I'm wondering if when you started looking for someone else , she realized you needed a more directive approach and changed accordingly. If you use insurance to pay,  I can almost guarantee that she's not in it for the money.  This is not a lucrative career , and mental health professionals who do make high income have no shortage of clients willing to pay. If she was worried about the money,  she could have just let you go and then take on someone else. Or charge a high cash fee and not bother with insurance.  Trying to make changes to keep someone who pays with insurance is about caring about that person,  as the unpaid time is not worth it for the money alone.  You have every right to find someone else if you want and I hope you find what you need.",58
lbltkd,"I'm homophobic. Not to other people, I act normal with them and treat them with the same respect I do any other soul. But I am to myself. I have been struggling to accept my sexuality. 24, male and gay. Grew up in a progressive country but not so progressive community (South Asian).  I have been struggling with this for years. I feel like I'm on the verge to lose the battle most of the time. I can't handle it on most days. I can't fathom being with a man. But I don't want to be alone. I always dreamt of a wife and kids, but I don't see that ever being possible.  My friends around me are all getting married, they're all in relationships. I'm alone, horny and fall in love with people not interested in men. Urges for my best friend, the inability to find a job since graduating, the thought I might be that 'uncle' make me feel disgusted in myself. I feel like an NPC in my own game. I feel disgusted in myself. I'm tired of being vulnerable. I'm tired of existing. The sheer volume of day to day tasks in unbearable. Tried medication, tried therapy. I don't know what to do.  That is all.","Your sexuality doesn't change who you are. I know it's hard to accept and you will look at a lot of gay people and think ""I don't want to be like that"". Thankfully, it doesn't work like that. You can be an uncle and be gay without being ""that gay uncle"".  I'm gay myself, and if you were to meet me, I'm just a normal person. You wouldn't know, yet I live with my boyfriend and we're planning on adopting someday.  Before you make any decisions about where to go with your love life, take some time to get to grips with who you are, and to accept yourself for who you are. Not to sound too cliché but your relationship with yourself is really the most important one you'll ever have. And at the moment, it sounds like you're really giving yourself a hard time.",29

lcolxb,"One week I’m talking about my relationship anxiety, another week I’m talking about procrastination, another week I’m talking about how unhappy and empty I felt, and then another week I’m talking about how great I’m feeling, then another week I’m talking about daddy issues, then another about anger fits, then back again to relationship anxiety.  I seem to have a new problem every single week and there is no one single agenda I can stick to. It’s like one week a problem dominates and the other problems don’t exist, then the next week another problem takes the throne and my other problems don’t exist. This leads me to talking about something new each week and it’s been 6 months. My psychologist gives me homework and an agenda to stick to but I literally can’t stick to an agenda.  I feel like I’m not getting anywhere with therapy. I don’t know what to bring up! There are about a million different things I can bring up in one session! It’s sooo fustrating! Does anyone else have this problem? I’m kind of all over the place and I’m worried my psychologist is getting fustrated too.

It makes me feel better knowing that I’m definitely not alone on this","i feel this 1000000%. sometimes i get self conscious about how i jump around during sessions but i’m realizing that by letting all these different issues out as they come up, it’s helping me get to the root of my issues little by little. my therapist is really great at helping me get to those “aha!” moments while venting so then we can talk about the experiences in my life that created certain mindsets and behavior patterns i have. i’m grateful bc my therapist is amazinggggg. maybe yours just isn’t the right fit for you? its definitely okay to try a few to find one that fits your needs and style",57
lddovb,"Whenever I think about the future, I get consumed by grief that it won't be with my parents. I love them but I also have to move on for my studies/career. How does one deal with the grief? How does one come to terms with the idea that the support system and cheerleaders that you have always had won't be there to stick around for long?","I feel this post in my *soul*. I had a bit of a complicated childhood from a therapy standpoint (trauma existed where I didn’t realize trauma could exist) but I still love my parents so much. Dad’s 10yrs older than Mom, and they’re actively planning their retirement life. Granted that’s still a healthy decade off but that still just so soon. Getting married for this very reason was *super* hard for me, and even now I feel a little pressure (self inflicted, not form family) to have children soon so my father can experience his grandchildren growing up before he inevitably passes before my mom.  It’s so freaking hard. No one talks about this side of growing up, moving out, getting married, etc. because it’s just assumed that people should handle this, but honestly give yourself grace and patience. Remind yourself of how proud they are of you (a parent’s life goal is to raise healthy children to go off and live healthy lives) and do what you can to truly cherish each moment. I found that I often live through phases where I’m just going through the motions, so forcing myself to slow down and just take it all in helps me.  Like others have said, take the time to write out things you want to do with them and make an effort to do those things. Likewise, do the same for conversations you want to have. Record stories and moments together; take tons of selfies and make them laugh. Life goes on this way and it’s hard, but survivable. Love to you!",24

Sometimes I can’t believe how lucky I got and I thank my lucky stars every day for giving me an opportunity with her.  I have expressed how much I love her to my family. How much she means to me and how great of a stepmom she would be. As parents do (I hope!), we would never put our children in danger, or put them in a position where they have a disadvantage in life. My family has basically informed me that if I continue my relationship with her then they will not be a part of my life AND my children’s lives.  So, I informed my family that if they want me and my children in their lives, then they need to earn it and accept me for who I am and who I am with. Do you believe this shit still exists in 2021?","Bruh, my husband went through the same shit last year. I am an atheist and I am tattooed, he and his family are middle eastern muslims. That's why his mom started calling me a devil worshipper and he decided to break contact after she convinced him that I have to convert to Islam. It was a long and hard journey before that. Although she is in Syria and he is in Europe with me, she tries to control everything all of her children do.  She successfully destroyed a wedding of her oldest son because the bride was ""too dark"" and that would ""destroy her beautiful white bloodline"". What the actual fuck. But my husband saw how much she hurt me, how much she had her fingers in our relationship and most of all: the psychological abuse she does to him.  So he had to decide: do I want to stay with my soulmate, or satisfy my family that lives on another continent and physically and psychologically abuses me till this day?  And he really managed to break contact, despite all the drama that came with this action. But you know what? In the end THEY came back to him, begging to be in contact again.

leqk2s,"Back when I lived in Nigeria, my family used to have this maid who would come clean the house everyday. Money, jewelry, and other valuables kept going missing around the house. At first my mother blamed my two older sisters, and would beat them every time something went missing. One day my mom found her necklace in the maid's work bag. When I came home from school the house was a complete mess. There was so much blood everywhere. I never saw the girl again. I didn't want to believe it for so long, but for some reason last night it snapped and I had a panic attack alone in my apartment. Growing up, my mother was abusive and always went into these white hot flashes of rage where she'll claim not to remember anything after. I don't want to believe it, but I know she's capable of this. She broke a doll house over my sister's back. She dipped a towel in boiling water and then wrapped it around my neck to get me to stop complaining about the neck pain I was having. If I misbehaved in school, she would beat me until my lips bled and tell me to ""watch myself bleed"" in the mirror. I know she can do this  She was only fucking 14.

lm4dus,"6 years ago.. I have been having a really hard time without him recently his death date was Feb 7, 2015. His name was Walter Morrison and he was 27 years old. He was so beautiful, long blonde hair and he loved the blues and blind melon. He was a chef and a skateboarder (hardcore skater) he was fearless in almost every sense of the word and he stood up for people he cared about. He was a “booster” always wanted everyone to shine around him. He was kind and compassionate and pure. I woke up lastnight and couldn’t go back to sleep I don’t normally think about his body afterwards.. But lastnight I remembered how beautiful he was even in death. He was familiar even then I kissed him one more time and it was so wrong it broke me. It sent me on a spiral lastnight.. He hung himself with a scarf my best friend gave him and there was a purple ring around his neck that they tried to hide with a scarf they bought that wasn’t his style he has fingernail scratches on his arms from struggling.. these images haunt me... I had him for awhile In this cold room saying goodbye to someone who was already gone. I don’t normally remember him that way. Not ever. I dont want to. I was so broken that the trauma has made me forget details like how I got there.. I don’t remember how I got home.. I don’t know. Regardless, I thought of those final moments with his body in an insomnia spell.. I fell asleep eventually and I dreamt about him.. We were huddled up by this old fireplace and just laughing and joking around.. Im a comedian and he was really funny too we cracked jokes all the time and we both just thought we were hilarious. So thats where we were.. Just giggling and holding onto one another by the fire. I woke up with that familiar tearing feeling it feels like someones tearing my heart in half I normally hold onto a pillow for dear life and cry it out. Its hard to face reality when hes not here it used to be confusing now its just reality.. I want to also note that his suicide was labeled “accidental suicide” he suffered from manic depression bipolar disorder and when he drank alcohol it exasperated symptoms and made him.. Different.. He was different that night slamming things playing loud music and I left him to go stay at my grandmothers house up the street because I needed to get sleep I managed a store and was opening the next day.. He begged me to stay with him and I left he said if I leave hes going to kill himself it seemed so ridiculous that I kinda rolled my eyes I told him “I love you..  just go to bed Walter” shortly after he did it. He wasn’t in his right mind and I was so young (22) I didn’t have the life experience I do now.. I definitely wouldn’t have left if I knew but I thought he was being funny from the alcohol and me leaving wasn’t a big deal.. It shouldn’t have been.. Im sorry I just don’t know who to turn to and I needed to get this out. I love him more than anything still to this day I was in love with him, no doubt in my mind. Ive tried to move on recently I met someone new but I don’t love him. He adores me but I just can’t seem to move on. I miss my bestfriend. My goof.

lm65te,"I've spent half my life (I'm 29 now) going to therapy at least once a month, sometimes once a week. After going around to over 20 different therapists and finally landing on a good one, she was unable to help me. I realized that I had trauma from my childhood that I've been carrying through adulthood. I found out I have issues with my mother and father and most of my family that was around when I was very young. Long story short, I found out I have an anxiety driven attachment style. My therapist for the last 5 years never made this clear that this is what she thought could be the cause of my pain and suffering. She specializes in childhood trauma. Not only this, but she ignored me for over a week while I was feeling suicidal. I confronted her about this today and she told me she has over 60 clients that she sees weekly. I asked her if she thought having so many clients might be spreading her too thin and if that could be effecting the effectiveness of her therapy. She said ""Possibly.."" Meanwhile, just hours before our final session, I learned that all my pain and suffering as an adult comes from trauma that I experienced as a child. Can anyone really justify therapy when there are so many free resources out there that can help that don't involve ""going for a walk to calm down"" or ""breathing exercises""?

Like the other commenter, it sounds like a potential panic attack. I would reflect on your day and the days leading up and just notice whether there was anything out of the ordinary.  If you do experience it again doing deep breathing can be very helpful as it activates the parasympathetic nervous system (which will calm you down physiologically) and the counting the breaths will serve as a distraction.

I say yes and my parents are still married. She asks me are you sure you are his biological child, I say yes, I'm pretty sure because I look like him.  She goes on a tangent about how I should try and get a paternity test done because she thinks my dad is acting this way towards me because there could be a possibility that I am not his. I repeat myself, again, I am his biological child. I look a lot like him and I don't think my mom would cheat on my dad even though he's an asshole. She keeps insisting that a biological father wouldn't treat their own child like that and that he's abusive towards me because something in him resents me and that it's probably because I am not his, and that she has seen this all the time. Like she wouldn't fucking let it go and told me to get a paternity test done by our next session. Yeah, no.  I am honestly so pissed off and just done with therapy forever. I don't make enough to waste hundreds of dollars trying to find a good fit for me. It's not worth my time or money and I feel fucking stupid for even being optimistic to try it again. Fuck this shit","Wow. I’ve had one amazing therapist and one horrible therapist. Ran back to the first one real quick. A bad therapist has the potential to do so, so, so much harm. It makes opening up and trusting again incredibly difficult. I’m so sorry that you’ve been put through this. It’s not acceptable at all.",35

I told her and she was super supportive! Honestly more supportive than I needs her to be and we talked about it for so long and she was so nice. It’s so weird hearing lesbian come out of other people mouth when talking about me. Phew my heart still beating sooo fast.

lq0zhf,"I have been seeing a new therapist for the past 6 months for EMDR therapy. Up until today she has been great and I have been finding the EMDR to be pretty helpful, but lately my depression has been creeping back up between fruitless job hunting and the winter blahs, so I’m finding it hard to get out of bed some days. When I told her about this she was very harsh with me out of nowhere.  She told me that I need to challenge my depression and “lying around not doing anything” won’t help me (which was MASSIVELY triggering because my abusive mother frequently accused me of being lazy/incompetent, which has been the subject of many EMDR sessions) and said almost angrily that it seems like the EMDR isn’t helping me at all. She then accused me of wanting a pill to fix all my problems (I am on antidepressants but never indicated that I’m expecting them to cure me) and said that I won’t get better by doing nothing. The thing is, I have been trying everything I can think of to get better (talk therapy, IOP program, EMDR, medication) and seriously prioritizing my mental health the past three years, so feel like I have been doing a lot! I just keep getting stuck. I told her as much but she insisted that I’m just waiting for something to fix me and asked what I’m actually doing to help myself. Because of her harsh tone I froze up and couldn’t think of anything to say and she used my silence to continue driving the point that I’m not doing enough. She spent our entire hour long session hammering this in until I was crying harder than I’ve ever cried in a therapy session, and she ended the call with me while I was still a blubbering mess. The only thing she had to say for herself was “I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this/rip the bandaid off.” It took me another hour to finally compose myself but every time I think about today’s session I start crying again. I feel so hurt and confused by the things she said, or maybe more so the way she said them. I feel like I got yelled at for an hour and feel like I can’t be helped because I’m not doing enough, even though I feel that I have been doing as much as I can. I feel like absolute shit. Was my therapist in the wrong today or did I just get triggered and take things the wrong way? I don’t know what to do or how to feel.",you're describing a red flag. one of the reddest on record.,128

lr6qcn,"I’m a 23M, I was recently diagnosed with PTSD, severe depression and sever anxiety disorder. I’m currently taking trazodone and sertraline. I was raped and molested at 4 years old until I was 6 by my neighbor. He’d tell me we were gonna watch skating videos and took me into his room. We moved away when I was 6. Here’s the crazy part, we moved back into the apartment complex. The exact same apartment I was raped in. My ROOM is the same room I was raped in. In every relationship I turned into whatever that other person wanted. Without knowing I did this all my life. I don’t even know what I’m actually like. I don’t wanna be like this anymore. I don’t wanna fake who I am anymore, but I don’t know who I am.","Oh my. Like the first comment said, I'm not an expert by any means, but can speak from experience. My SO has a similar history with similar feelings, similar mental health issues, and I want to share with you some insights from therapy that may be helpful/grounding. But first, I want to tell you how it makes me feel. It makes me feel Angry, not at you obviously, but at those who harmed you, I often experience anger as a tightness in my jaw which I'm feeling right now for you. It also makes me feel so sad for you, sad for your loss of self. Trauma, abuse, neglect they not only hijack our brains, but they cover up our true self, the person with essential meaning and goodness, the person who I believe you're talking about when you say ""I don't know who I am"" The good news is, with the proper help and support you can discover that person and finally let them out, you can let them no that they belong, even though life has told them otherwise. Once they/you realize that they belong, then you can start becoming that person writing your own story apart from all the stories that were put on you growing up. Here's the practical stuff 1. find a therapist who specializes in trauma, often called trauma responsive therapy, or therapies that are informed about emotions. Regular talk therapy can be good, but I know for me talking to a trauma therapist has been especially helpful. Before I started talking to her, I actually did not even realize that I had trauma to overcome. We all have trauma, and that's why a trauma therapist can be particularly helpful, because a good one knows how to bring those things up in a compassionate way so that they can finally heal. 2. The reason I named my emotions earlier is because that is part of the work. Being able to name our emotions, and share them with others. not only does it help us to connect with people on a real way and become more empathetic, but in general, we typically repress and push down the emotions that we don't like. Furthermore this is normally supported by unconscious messaging we pick up growing up. ""Oh don't be angry little timmy"" are caregivers mean well when they say those things, but they are encouraging us to repress our emotions. All emotions belong, emotions are not good or bad, some are just more difficult to handle. But finding healthy ways to experience your emotions will allow you to embrace your true self more. Repressed emotion, pain and Trauma is often a lot of the cause to the issues you are experiencing. 3. My therapist, from what I understand is pretty up to date on what we currently know, but has also told me that it sometimes takes about a decade for the most current practices and knowledge to filter down to the mainstream. That means said, she is very good at not only helping me uncover the subconscious stories, messaging and fears from my childhood, but also good at helping me understand what is physiologically going on in my body as a response to the things that trigger me. We are a complicated but also beautiful combination of neurological, sociological and biological factors. When you understand this and you work with a therapist that understands this, it allows you to learn how to get all of those different parts of yourself working together, which then allows you to be a more integrated and full person. 4. things that have helped alongside my therapy, on a very practical level has been mindfulness and meditation practices. Just a year ago, if you knew me I was not the type of person that would have considered or embraced those things. But it truly has been transformative.  5. One book in particular that has been super helpful for me that I want to recommend is called ""You're a miracle and a pain in the ass"" the audiobook is read by the author and pretty easy to listen to it mixes what we know about what is going on inside of us when we are experiencing all these different issues, mixed with the author's own personal story. It's informative and educational but also personal which makes it easy to understand. In summary... You have all these complicated stories, and layers that have been placed on top of you and they cover up who you really are. They are not your fault, but they are now your responsibility to deal with. It is totally fine to be angry about that, to be upset about that, but careful that you do not over identify with your anger, or the stories that your pain and Trauma tells you. You get to process the pain and hurt from those stories, and at the same time take away and keep the lessons from those stories. This will help you become less reactive, more responsive and ultimately a more resilient person. for example I grew up in a pretty traditionally religious home. That home life comes with a whole set of stories, I've had to learn to reject some of the rigid judgmental parts of that upbringing, but embrace the fact that that same upbringing gave me a strong sense of conviction, and a strong moral compass. I tend to talk in over share a lot, so I will cut this off here. If you have any questions feel free to reach out, I love to share and communicate what I'm learning with others! I believe you can heal, I believe you can grow, I believe that the person inside of you, the person that you have not yet met, is absolutely a wonderful person.",28
lronnn,"Thats the sum of it lol but I wanted to share because so many of us get churned through the system so much. Im a mh professional and even i have (had?) developed a massive distrust in psychiatry. I have a history that includes being secretly diagnosed and punished with harmful labels when ive reached out for help.  So today i met a nice one. A really fucking nice one who treated me with respect and was kind. Who didnt push me to report my abuser or blame me. He listened to my expertise and concerns without talking down to me. And it doesnt/shouldnt matter, but he did those things whilst being a man ...men are not high on my trust level at the moment.

ltds2k,"I took a 3 hour nap over the course of the afternoon today because I just didn't see a point in staying awake, I'm unemployed because of the apocalypse and aside from sending out applications I don't really do much anymore outside of collect covid relief and watch Netflix, so there are times when I just decide to pass out for a few hours just to kill time, problem is its become routine to the point where I actually start to feel tired at around the same time every day, I know I need to fill my days with something more productive, but we just came out of lockdown a couple weeks ago so the only thing there is to do is go to a restaurant and drink, I'm literally losing my mind to boredom and I'm struggling to see why I should bother doing anything about it","Therapist here. I know what you're going through. There are only so many resumes you can send out and applications you can fill out before you are spent, and then what else is there to do? It is easy to do something once and then allow it to become a habit, as you have done with Netflix and naps.

We just found out my brother in law and his girlfriend is pregnant and it triggered a depressive episode for me.  Idk why. It just hurt to see someone else have what I’ve been wanting but can’t have. I tried to vent to my friends but they completely ignored me. Everytime I talk about my baby they ignore me. My husband tries to be there but it’s not the same as having my actual girl friends to vent to.

luhjad,"I'm not someone who looks for attention, in very private, and quiet. However, when ever something happens good or bad, I feel like I'm overdoing it for sympathy or attention - even when I'm alone. I'll feel nervous from reading an article, and then my brain says ”Oh you're not really nervous, you just want attention.” and no one is even there. Or I'll try to do something nice, and (like even typing this- and typing that) my brain goes, ”Nice? You want people to know your nice. You're a bad person. Oh I bet you want sympathy for that too.” I wanted to add a comma after ”Oh”, but if I did it would be to seem smart. Now I'm trying to seem smart. And even typing this is overdramatic because it isn't that bad (but it is.) I'm sure you can imagine the dialogue going on from talking about this. I really need help. (A cry for help? Attention seeking.) I hate this.

lwtj3f,"not really a question, more of a vent post. i finally managed to scrounge up the courage to find a therapist, and it's been absolutely impossible to find one in my area who's accepting new patients, even if i'm willing to pay out-of-pocket instead of through insurance. everyone i've contacted has been full so far. i just don't understand how people who need help are supposed to get help. reaching out to this many people is really taxing for me; even though i know it's only natural that people are fully booked right now, especially with covid stress, my brain keeps framing it as rejection and it's triggering a lot of my social anxiety. it was extremely difficult to convince myself to seek therapy in the first place, and this is only fueling my fears that i shouldn't. and honestly, i think i'm pretty functional. i don't know how people who have worse mental states than mine are supposed to navigate this mess of a system. it just really sucks. rant aside, any advice for finding someone who isn't fully booked?","I posted something similar in another comment but it still holds:  Unfortunately this is quite common— I am a therapist but when I was seeking my own therapist, I probably contacted at least 10 potential providers. Contacting 20 is supposedly not uncommon. When therapists are full they sometimes do not put systems in place to stop the flow of referrals and do not even attempt to call the many many people who continue to contact them. I recommend writing out a brief template, and emailing 5+ copy and pasted emails per day until someone responds. You can often email therapists on Psychology Today. That way, you can save your time and energy by not calling people unless they respond that they do have an opening. Keep the emails brief though- just a few sentences, not your life story.",40

m17lht,"You are not your feelings. People wrongly identify with their feelings. They feel anxious, so they tell themselves a story, ‘I’m anxious, I have anxiety.’ This leads to living a life in which we’re trying to avoid certain feelings or chasing others. We reach a state of calm. Then we start to think about how to hold on to it. How to stay in this state forever. Then the calm is gone and we’re anxious again.  Understand: Your feelings are impermanent. You are meant to feel. Emotions exist so that we can feel them, the full range. Happy, sad, bored, discontent. Stop thinking about your feelings as a permanent state and realize you have the power to change it. When you think of Mike Tyson, ‘Iron Mike,’ ‘The Baddest Man on the Planet.’ A career record of 50-6, 44 knockouts, arrested more than 30 times before he was 13. You don’t think of someone who felt a lot of fear.  It’s hard to imagine him in tears before a fight. Pacing around outside crying and overcome by anxiety and fear. Tyson’s trainer and adopted father, Cus D’Amato would say, “The hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear.”  Tyson felt fear, it was a feeling he had. But then he moved forward. After those tears is a fight that was stopped in his favor after about 35 seconds. Thoughts, emotions, feelings. They’re like clouds, they come and go. Not here forever. Not gone forever.  In ***The Wisdom of Insecurity***, Alan Watts explains that if, “we are to be fully human and fully alive and aware, it seems that we must be willing to suffer for our pleasures.” If you never want to feel sad. You’ll never feel happy. If you never want to feel anxious, you won’t know contentment. If you’ve never had a bad day, you won’t recognize a great one. The alternative to feeling is numbness. It’s bland, mediocre and average. It’s half alive.   You can’t control your feelings, but you can control how you react to them. Accept that your feelings are impermanent. They come and go. They’re feelings, not a life sentence. ",Something that I learned from my favorite show.. “Feelings are not facts”,5

Then i took 75mg of a medication used for insomnia/severe anxiety this doesn’t produce a high but it makes you sleepy and i’ve found it to amplify the effects of other substances (mixing a downer and an upper not good already). then about an hour went by and I decided to drink again so I went to the kitchen and drank about 4-5 shots of of an alcohol that sounds like daniels jack (mixing dark and light idk how i didn’t puke) at this point i’m extremely drunk but decided to snort some more of the ADHD medication. i have ADHD myself so it would take a lot for me to feel the effects but at this point i’m at 180mg which is 6x the highest dose prescribed for ADHD. This is where things got extremely bad. But I went to the kitchen and drank a few more shots of a third type of alcohol that i don’t know what it was but it was strong. I was still on facetime with about 5 people the whole night with a few people coming in and out.  I completely blacked out from 2-5am which was scary because my friends have been saying it really bad. I found two 7 minute screen recordings in my camera roll of me on facetime and using my phone, I don’t think I knew i was screen recording.

I feel like I should tell my mom but I know I would get admitted to the mental hospital and my parents would never trust me again. And i know everyone would think of me differently.  My other friend was also doing some other substances as well as some alcohol and she ended up telling her mom because it got too bad and now she was admitted to the ward. and I think I would be in the same boat if I snitch on myself but my health needs to come first so I don’t know what to do. PLEASE HELP anything is appreciated! TLDR: I think I overdosed on multiple substances tuesday night and I don’t know what to do.","I’m 23 I’m a recovering drug addict I have been sober for almost 4 years. I started using when I was your age. This is my personal opinion. it sounds like you just got extremely messed up and your body is not used to it. Alcohol, drugs, whatever... it’s a foreign substance you’re putting into your body. And you’re so young be careful. I have had several severe overdoses that landed me in the hospital. Then also experiences like you are discussing where my body was “off” and I blacked out. I can’t remember weeks at a time from my teenage years from so much drug use. Drink lots of fluid and take care of yourself. You will recover physically, you sound okay to me but I am NOT a doctor. If you continue to have weird physical symptoms then yes tell your parents. But what is more concerning to me is your alcohol and drug use. The behavior is a sign of something deeper. Are you hurting emotionally? I promise that drugs and alcohol are a long dark fucking dreadful road.",48

m4x1ya,"I've been in therapy for about 4 months now. My therapist is great and I really connect with her. But i cant seem to reach my goal. I have / had one goal basically to let go of something. Something that really reached my unconscious mind years ago. Something that was deeper than anything Ive experienced in my 28 years of life. And we found it, the root of the problem. We spent months working on the why and i feel about a month ago, that i had a ""break through"" because we truly discovered *why* i cannot let go and why i havent met my goal and why i cant get over this thing... and now its like i still cannot reach my therapeutic goal and im starting to think, that maybe there are just somethings that the human brain is not meant to let go of, that that feeling, memory, imprint is there and youll never escape it bc it was that important.... Which worries me because i dont want to feel this way forever which is why i started therapy in the first place. But i fear that this thing will plague me for years and years to come and ive read these books to help myself as well:  Breaking the Habit of being Yourself by Joe Dispenza (reaching your unconsious mind to change your belief system and emotions) The Naked Mind by Anne Grace (about addition and the unconscious mind), Psychocybernuetics by Maxwall Maltz (similar to Dispenza's book) , The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer ( about mediation and ego and separating the self), etc. Ive done so so much work these past few years, on top of therapy and these self help books, ive traveled, ive had good experiences, ive done everything one can think of... Is it possible that there are just some things in life that the mind will not transform into something positive, or let go, or change a belief? I feel like i just want to be free from this , but theres the other part of me that doesnt want to be free bc letting go hurts just as much. Why wont my unconscious mind comply with my logic ? Why am not able to just ... get there in therapy?? I do believe i really know the answer why it just goes back to my childhood and my inner child for sure... Maybe im just stuck with this forever ? TDLR: Is it possible that the human brain just will not let things go no matter how much therapy and work you put into trying to let go? &#x200B; Edit: Wanted to edit this post and say a thank you to all of the extremely thoughtful, kind, openminded, deep, insightful, vulnerable, and truly helpful responses in this thread. Youre all such great people taking the time to respond to this in depth and honestly, and i want to say i appreciate it a lot. You have all touched on *reframing how* i see this, or feel/ think about my situation and youre all right. Best of luck to everyone in this thread as well. Thanks guys :) the replies truly helped me today and ill be applying your advice to my journey ","TL;DR - Your therapeutic goal might not appropriately match your need. Consider reassessing the validity of your goal. Also, everything takes a lot of practice. Be patient. With practice, you will be able to do in ten years what is impossible for you today. Control is often not the answer. Acceptance is usually the effective solution in mental health. The brain is a processor, but unlike the colon it keeps what you put into it as memory. So, I have these memories—awful, traumatic memories. I can’t condemn them or jettison them. I cannot change their content. I spent decades trying. They are there to stay. But I was wrong about my suffering. I was not being tormented or imprisoned by the memories or the traumas they recorded. I was being tormented by my estimation of them. I was keeping them salient through obsession. I was keeping them powerful through my resentments, indignation, and fears. I was replaying them with the belief that I had to confront, condemn, and close the door on these past events. I had the wrong goals. I mean, the desire to heal my thoughts, feelings, and beliefs was not wrong. But the goals to control and condemn were misplaced. My refusal to forgive and accept these events as a part of my story, and therefore forever an aspect of who I am today, was causing my mental anguish. Accepting and forgiving were swear words to me. I would boil with anger at the suggestion that I could forgive what happened to me. I felt like I was being told to approve of the trauma. To condone it. To be okay with what happened. But all of that rage and resistance was the result of a complete misunderstanding. Acceptance is not approval. Forgiveness is not “It’s okay.” If it were okay, there would be no need for forgiveness. Acceptance, or forgiveness, is an acknowledgement of the reality without further protest. It is a tattoo on your back. You don’t see it much any more, but it is no less there. When something or someone makes you aware of it, that awareness is not emotionally salient. It does not haunt your dreams. It no longer fuels your resentments or fears. Your emotional estimation of it no longer informs your choices and efforts. My brain does not ever let go of trauma. I simply redefine what that trauma means to me. I can do this because while I don’t have full agency over external factors, and I don’t have full agency over my brain function, I do have full agency over my estimation of those things. I decide what they mean to me, and I had to decide they weren’t going to weigh me down anymore. Was that easy or even possible with the snap of the fingers? No. I had to master it with practice. A lot of practice. They say it takes ten years of practice to master a skill. This is no different. Be patient with yourself. Set goals that are realistic, and then give yourself a lot of patience as you practice the skills necessary to achieve those goals.",77
m5fd4n,Or is thinking about killing yourself and not actively trying to do so a normal thing that everyone thinks about. I can't help but think I'm making a big deal out of some small stuff.,"When I start having thoughts of suicide, I usually see that as a sign that I need to really up the self-care. I think about adjustments I can make in my life to help eliminate them. This has, in the past, included things like going to therapy.  If you feel like you are making a big deal out of “small stuff”, why do you think you feel this way?  My family growing up often minimized my concerns and made me feel like I was overreacting. Sometimes I still doubt or minimize my own experience because of this conditioning. My point is that your feelings are valid, especially if they are causing you to have thoughts of suicide.  More on whether you’re making a big deal out of “small things”. The pandemic has been really difficult and has exacerbated aspects of everyone’s lives. Mental health issues like anxiety and depression have been reported in record numbers this year. Again, the feelings you’re experiencing are valid. Personally, think that therapy can be a good tool for anybody, pandemic, or suicidal ideation aside. Sometimes it takes a little while to find the right therapist and waiting for a new patient consult can sometimes take more time than is ideal. Still, I think talking to the right person could be really worthwhile.  And please know, that no matter how hopeless you feel, things do get better.  One last thing. I know you say you aren’t acting on these thoughts, but a friend of mine once accounted their suicide attempt and they recalled being really sad in the moment they thought they thought they were going to die because “suicide was such a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” And that kind has always stuck with me.  If you are considering actually acting on these thoughts. Please reach out to someone who can help you more immediately than a therapist.  I want you to know that you aren’t alone and I hope you start to feel better. Hugs!",25
m5qvpb,"I got a new therapist since my last one moved locations, and we weren’t really meshing well. Two weeks in, she asked me something that I never acknowledged the answer to until then. Because I had never been asked.  “Rhenby, are you exhausted?” I broke down into tears and replied “yes. I’m so, so exhausted...” A lot of the weight of being poor, struggling academically, and holding trauma I have daily triggers for, seemed to finally let up off my shoulders. I had never been asked that before, and so I had never thought about it. But yeah, I was really fucking exhausted. I still am, but now I know and I know someone else knows and is trying to help me with it.",You got this bud. Congratulations on the great new therapist!,40

m7svxn,"I'm looking for a new therapist and I've been calling a few to ask whether they have open spots.  Called this male therapist today and I can't even summarize what the hell happened. The conversation went like this:  Me: 'Hi, my name is XX . I'm looking for a new therapist and I was wondering whether you accept new clients or have a waiting list' Him: 'I don't have any open spots but I do have a waiting list'  'Oh well, is it possible to do a trial session to see whether I want to be placed on the waiting list?'  'Maybe you could tell me your diagnosis first'  'I have a recurrent depression and...'  'You don't sound depressed'  '...what? My previous therapists and I would strongly disagree'  'Well, you sound quite allright'  'You think I'm not depressed because I don't sound depressed during a 2 minute phone call? I'm really good at sounding functional due to my history and...'  'Yes, if you'd be truly depressed you wouldn't be able to turn the depression off for a phone call'  'Ummmm...ok. You know what, I'm no longer interested in the waiting list. Thank you for your time. Bye'   Parts of me are just laughing because it's so bizarre and unprofessional?! But my other parts want to cry. I grew up with a depressed mother who also struggled with alcohol addiction. My parents separated when I was quite young and my father had a new family that I wasn't allowed to meet (though I saw him on a regular basis. Yes, it's super weird looking back). I wasn't allowed to tell anyone about my home life growing up and all the internalized shame made it super hard for me to seek treatment for myself.  First therapist and first person I EVER told about my childhood was a college therapist. My last severe depression episode was 3 years ago and I'm still not fully recovered from it, despite being on constant therapy/medication/mental health wards. But I've been mostly functional for the last 2 years.   I've faked being allright during my whole childhood (and my 20s tbh). I've been super anxious about calling new therapists and I've been putting it off for months. And now some random dude thinks I'm not depressed. Dude. I'm on an olympian level of 'fake it till you make it'. What on earth does a depressed person even sound like?! Are comedians allowed to be depressed? Because, you know, they laugh on occasion.",This is a ridiculous conversation. You are way better off not going to this man. Keep trying. Perhaps you should look for someone who has experience dealing with trauma ( like your childhood) and is trained in a trauma modality. EMDR or CBT-tr. Depression often is caused by an unresolved traumatic childhood.,133

You should absolutely reach out to a therapist to process through all of this. You deserve to come to terms with what happened to you and feel better.

m8rlvz,"TW: rape, sexual assault, elderly abuse Hi r/therapy. I'm reeling from something that happened within my family and I don't feel comfortable speaking with friends about it, or even my therapist just yet. Verbally discussing it is just too hard right now, and I'm hoping to use this as a safe space to talk through what I'm going through. Please refer to trigger warning content above before proceeding. This morning my father received a phone call regarding my grandmother. She currently lives out-of-state in an assisted living setup, but in a regular home versus a large facility. Due to the way her insurance works, she had to be placed somewhere in the state where she had worked prior to retiring, so she was unable to stay with us. She also is in the later stages of alzheimers disease, which my family is unequipped to care for. My father did extensive research, and chose her current residence due to the high reviews and the environment, which seemed less ""sterile"" than larger facilities. She has been living at this place for 8 years without a hitch, and has seemingly had good care throughout the time that's she been there. We and other family members have visited several times and nothing has ever seemed ""amiss"". That changed today. A hospice worker came into the place and discovered the homeowner's husband in the shower with my grandmother, and he was forcing her to do certain sexual acts on him that I don't care to elaborate on. Authorities have been notified and there is currently an investigation underway. It goes without saying, but my father plans on suing the company. We currently don't know how long this has been transpiring, as the homeowner's husband (who owns the facility and is also certified to watch over the residents), takes over when the caretaker has a day off or goes to shop for the residents. I am sick to my stomach right now, and am having a hard time processing this sick, sick, act. My grandmother didn't deserve this, (no one does). She has been through so much during her life, and this time in her life was supposed to be safe and comfortable while we waited for the inevitable to happen with her Alzheimers.  Her mental condition has noticeably gotten worse than before within the last few months, and I suspect that this monster had something to do with it. My heart is breaking for her and my family, and I'm at a loss.    Edit: Updated some information I had wrong. I had said it was the caretaker's husband, but it was the homeowner's husband. I also just found out my grandmother has been there for 8 years, not 5. I also wanted to thank everyone who's reached out. You've helped me with processing this more than you know, and for that you all have my deepest thanks.","Ugh, it’s always so sickening to hear about these things happening to such a vulnerable population. It’s estimated about 1/10 elders suffer from some form of elder abuse. Not only can this be traumatic for your grandmother, but for her family that loves her as well. You guys seem like you have really been looking out for her to the best you can, but that unfortunately this awful man has been taking advantage without anyone noticing. I’m glad the authorities have been contacted. You most likely will need to process this like a trauma, and go through your grieving process. This is definitely a start writing things out to help get it out of your head. Hopefully it will help start to organize your thoughts, and with time, I’m sure you’ll get to a point of processing it with your therapist and family. I’m so sorry to hear this happened, it makes me very sad knowing these things are happening out there.",81
m94h73,"I had my first therapy session yesterday and she wanted to know me so I had to ""spill the beans"" and I mean EVERYTHING. And I want to get better so I told her things ive never told anyone and im going back in april. But after the session I was dead tired,like a semi had run over me and I had nightmares during the night/flashbacks to the things I talked about. And today, I am so tired I cant do anything, my whole body hurts and im so nauseated is this normal?","Therapist here. As others have said, this is a normal reaction and, to go a step further, it's a good thing! It means that you have been carrying a lot of heavy baggage for a while and you've finally put it down for a moment and shared that burden with someone else. That is one reason why therapists exist - to help you carry a burden, to help you bear a cross (or multiple crosses, as the case may be). Celebrate that exhaustion.  I just got my first of two covid shots, and for the past 36 hours I have had no energy, my left shoulder has been sore as hell, and I have had a spacey head if I stand up or turn around too quickly. But you know what? That means it's working, so I don't begrudge the momentary discomfort. It will pass, and both myself and those in my life will be all the better for it. The same is true for therapy. You're doing this for you, and it is - and will continue to be at times - uncomfortable, but that just means you're moving in the right direction. And as a result, both you and those close to you will benefit as you begin to grow in strength and courage.  Lean into it. Pain **can be** a very good thing.",108

ma9u5r,"I find myself wanting to interact with my family less and less. 70% of our interactions are negative and leave me feeling much worse off than before the interaction. I just had a phone call with my mom where she hung up crying. Background:I'm 38 years old. Male 2 parents, still married, in their 70s, retired with not much going on 1 brother Growing up: normal suburbia mid-size town life. Played sports, parents went to games, supported me, gave me their best advice, nothing really bad. Dad came off as a know it all and posed his advice as fact which I listened to because he was successful and I didn't know any better and his advice turned out to be very limiting and dead wrong in many instances that really hurt me. &#x200B; Now:I live 3 hours away. Parents want to talk to me all the time but I do not enjoy our phone calls nor being around them. We used to see each other 1x ever 2-3 months until probably 80% of those interactions turned out to be very negative with one of us leaving early or a really big nasty blowout argument with yelling. I am increasing how harsh/mad I get the older I get... I thought it'd be the opposite. I think I have so many other great things going on in my life that I value my time more than ever so when something negatively impacts my life I immediately want to push it out. &#x200B; My dad:interrupts, tells me what to do (is wrong almost all the time), doesn't say anything about his life or anything... just wants to talk about me/interview me, comes off as very arrogant (states things as fact rather than his opinion) then defends himself vigorously when he's questioned, is extremely long-winded, very bad communicator. Not articulate at all and it's a struggle to understand what he's even trying to say half the time. Basically, the conversations become completely uninteresting and require a lot of patience and I don't think either of us get any value out of them so what's the point? My mom:very loving and nice. No problems with her except she is not that articulate either and is long-winded and doesn't share much about her life and prefers to interview me. She also is a very scared/worried type of person and projects that on me. If I take a trip she will research all the dangers and let me know of ALL of them and nothing positive at all. Just a scared mentality and I have the complete opposite mentality and it's very irritating to constantly be badgered with that. Unfortunately, things are so rough with my dad that she will say things that remind me of him and trigger reactions that are too extreme for what they should be. She's basically getting dumped on by me and I don't give her enough patience. &#x200B; Overall:I'm just not enjoying talking to them like I used to. They aren't doing anyting in particular that's ""bad"" but I just don't have an interest in it and the ""bad"" things they do are really impacting me negatively. The way they are is wearing me thin and I'm not happier or feeling better off after we talk... even if there is no fight on the phone I'm just like ""welp there went 30 mins for nothing"". It makes me feel terrible. I have this huge amount of guilt like I owe them for raising me, caring for me, giving me life etc. I also get very sad when I think of them getting older and how much or little time we may have left. I read something recently where a guy said how old do you think your parents will live till? How about 90. You see them 4x per year. So if they're 70, that's 20 more years, 4x per year, so only 80 more times you see them. That perspective really hit me but the problem is I'm still just not enjoying talking with them. I'm considering not going home for the holidays. My parents aren't that close with anyone else nor have any other family (their parents RIP). &#x200B; When we fight:My patience is very low. I give them 1-2 chances then I get very stern/harsh with them. When I get harsh they get very defensive and never take responsibility. Instead, the conversation now becomes me being too harsh. I take what they do very seriously... like someone calling me ""idiot"" does not impact me but them doing what they do does the same damage as if I'd call them ""idiot"" but they don't understand that. The other aspects of my life I really love so when we fight, I immediately am like why are we even talking I'm going to go and just end the phone call and don't talk for another 1-2 weeks... but that's turning into 2-3 weeks... and will progress into even longer. I didn't talk to my dad for 3 months last year and I'd say overall I felt better. Right now I feel like my only option is to grin and bear it or just speak to them only when I'm in a great mood with a lots of patience and keep the calls short... I'd love to have that movie style family where we play games, have dinners, talk all the time etc. I've tried VERY hard for 5 years to do that. Read books, talked with other people for HOURS, talked to them at EXTREME lengths about how I was feeling, why I felt that way, what I suggest we try etc but the results are nearly non-existant. &#x200B; I guess I'm at a wits end. I don't know what to do. I've read books, forum posts, friends, etc and tried a million different things and nothing has helped. I don't think our relationship will ever be what I want it to be and that's disappointing and sad because to me it seems very easy to achieve.  They flat out refuse any kind of therapy and view me as the problem. They think I'm just an angry guy and they aren't doing anything wrong/bad. I believe that their belief of theirs is causing them to not make any real change so this situation will likely just stay the same. I also know I am 100% responsible for my actions and how I feel. I just feel bad that I don't want to talk to them anymore really. I am worried I will regret it but the constant fights are really taking a toll on me. This has held me back from other aspects of my life so incredibly much and is impacting how I treat other people. &#x200B; Any advice would be great. Thank you","It’s perfectly valid to feel what you feel and not want to spend time with them at this point. Reading your post, hell, I wouldn’t want to spend time with them either. So don’t feel guilty for feeling the way you do; there’s probably a reason for it.  However, I feel like the root of the issue boils down to who your parents are not matching your vision of who you want them to be. It’s perfectly fine to want parents that you WANT to be around, that you WANT to visit and spend time with them, that you WANT to be around your kids. You (and all of us) deserve to have such parents.  However, if there’s one lesson that life will make sure you learn the hard way, if not the easy way, is accepting people the way they are, and that you can’t change them. Accepting them means, among other things, acknowledging their flaws and seeing that as a reflection of them, rather than you.  It’s also hard to let go of who you want and deserve your parents to be. It’s a journey and at times you might feel grief, anger, sadness, and more. It parallels mourning the loss of a loved one, because in the end, your vision of them, is a loved one, so mourn away if you need to.  It’s also perfectly fine to establish boundaries and put some space between you and them, even if you accept them fully the way they are. It is only you who can make the decision on whether you want to accept them, have a relationship with them, and what kind of boundaries you are willing to put up or dissolve.  Good luck!",34
makdjx,"So I’ll start from the beginning. Today while I (17F), was at school, my mother decided to look through my room. In which she found my older sisters alcohol bottle and tissues with blood on them (from not so healthy coping mechanisms). When I got home, she accused me of drinking and also added on she saw the tissues, and decided she had the right to remove my door. She went on about her trying to leave me be/have my privacy (she hasn’t), and she had enough. Mind you, my room can easily be seen from the living room so seriously zero privacy.  I, obviously with a lack of privacy and upset, pack my things for school tomorrow and some clothes and left. On the way out I was called a brat for not answering her where I was going (I didn’t want her following me so I didn’t respond). I’m currently at a friends house and I’m feeling shit. All of this has been overwhelming and I’ve made arrangements on going to a friends house after this house as they don’t know how long they can keep me for.  I honestly don’t know what to do though. Talking to her isn’t on the table as I’ve tried and it doesn’t get through to her. It’s not like I can call authorities since it’s not that extreme. But I’m at a loss with my feelings and stressed about everything going on. Any advice or nice comments are appreciated. Edit 1: positing this note since I’ve sent some confused comments about this. The only thing that was my sister was the bottle. My tissues were mine. Also, she already knew that I do this as she forced me to talk about my depression in some random car park that I didn’t know where we were, and then belittled and insulted me for it. I’ve also had her at later dates say that I do it for attention and because it’s trendy.",Seriously who invented this removing the door thing its so fucked.,23
mc48kq,"I mean as you read in the title, it's only my fault if I feel like this. I'm a 26yo female and I'm a couple years late with my university studies. I've always been a huge procrastinator, but I've always done my duty (last minute). Until few years ago. The first years of uni went okay, even though I felt the baggage was too much for me and the things I choose to study were different from what I expected and way too much for me. But again, I did everything I had to for the first 3 years. Then, when I started the last 2 years, I started going slower and slower...""I don't like this exam/this is too difficult for me, if I take it in the next session I'll get a higher grade""...until I started not actually doing exams but just procrastinating them. I mean, the last time I did one was like during summer 2019. So a very long time ago. (I don't blame covid bc as you see the problem started way earlier. Covid just made it worse) I'm obv experiencing a huge study block and an existential/identity crisis. I feel miserable and anxious, I'm questioning all my life choices and at this point and I don't even know nothing about my future job, I also feel incompetent and useless and a prisoner of my negativity. My self esteem has always been a bit low but not THIS low. I'm negative all the time and I can't find ONE thing I'm proud of about myself. I feel shitty and miserable all the time. I hate myself...even for hating myself. I spend my days procrastinating things I have to do (my only activity is using social media on the phone), and when I don't feel bad or sad I simply feel nothing, I'm completely apathetic, a passive spectator of my own life. I worry too much about what other people think of me, and I compare my useless life to theirs. My gf is very supportive but she (like my friends) unfortunately can't solve my problems for me. At first my parents were angry with me but they're supportive anyway. They're concerned for me. They're generous enough to pay therapy for me, hoping it helps. I have all these people in my life and I don't even deserve their love. I started T a couple months ago and it's nice to talk with someone from the outside. My T often tells me that there's hope, that I have plenty of options and I can surely find again the strength I once had, by being more positive and disciplined; that my current situation is more common than I think. ""You don't have past trauma or a disfunctional family, or depression. Everyone is here to support you. Yours is a common situation, you can make it if you want to."" She once said that it just seems an ""adjustment disorder with depressed mood"". She said this kinda casually, I don't even think it was a real diagnosis. She then said I can try serotonergic drugs for some time (like less strong and not addictive antidepressant with little side effects). I think I will. My mental state is caused by this long lasting (self induced) stressful situation of nothingness that my life is. This is not a real mental condition, this is not for example depression I have just because of genetics or trauma in my life. I caused my suffering with my own hands. I DECIDED to be this miserable, with poor choices day by day. I DECIDED to be lazy, every day, for years. As I said, I've always been a huge procrastinator. My mom since I was really young has always told me ""You can't be like this forever, it will be a bigger problem in the adult world"", that always pissed me off because I was like ""What do you want I'm even good at school this is just the way I function"" no this is not. And she was right. This is not the way I function. This has never been. This is just a terrible habit I've always had, and now it's 1000 times harder to change. Because I'm an adult. Because I failed, and I feel like it's not worth it anymore. I really can't find motivation. With my T I sometimes tend to belittle my emotions. I'm usually honest, but I try to be rational and down to earth when I describe how I feel. I don't want everything to sound worse than it actually is, because I'm always wondering if my mind is the problem. I mean, maybe I'm just making a big deal out of a totally normal situation? Should I just stop complaining, force myself to somehow do my last exams without thinking about my regrets of the past and anxiety for the future? But it does not seem easy. Or am I just whiny? Or am I faking all this ""suffering"" in order to feel less guilty? I know nothing anymore Please help me, I need a stranger's advice. Thank you if you've made it to the end","Look into ADHD testing. It can cause depression even if you don't feel like you're sad/depressed enough.  It causes executive dysfunction, when even if you really want to accomplish basic things, like hobbies you like, you can't force yourself to and you feel so guilty. Everything just feels harder, work school, social life, feels draining and harder to keep up with. Have low self confidence and guilt is a huge part of it.  There are lot of symptoms of it that are not commonly known and they mimic true depression and anxiety and other disorders. Also it's been a widespread societal belief that anyone who has issues with functioning is ""lazy"" when if you feel guilty about it and want to improve it's not laziness, it's genuine mental/emotional disorders, mental illness causing these problems.",44
md0bmz,"Last night while I was out with my girlfriend and my friend, my girlfriend went to the bathroom we were all inside and a man hiding in the stall next to her peeped out over the stalls and reached out to touch her. This caused her incredible amounts of distress especially because of her history with similar kinds of people. We went to the police, found the guy and made a report but Puerto Rican law considers this deviant act not sexual assault/harrassment but “disturbing the peace” and “aggravated assault”  It’s the next day and she feels shaken up and sick but she can’t see her therapist because she’s on vacation. She doesn’t know what to do or how to cope. We need help and appreciate any. Thank you.","Hey, I'm so glad she is safe and surrounded by loved ones who support her.  Maybe I don't understand fully, but it sounds like she wasn't touched?  If that's the case, I feel relieved for her.  But I totally relate to people being creeps like that :( Just take it a day at a time.  Find other things to focus on.  If it helps any, maybe carrying pepper spray or some other legal type of defense mechanism would be helpful.  There have been several men who violated me from as early as 4 to as recent as high school.  Everything after high school so far has just been stalkers or an attempted sex trafficking thing.  No matter what it is, it's scary.  So I totally relate to her.  I felt a little better when I carried around pepper spray.  But I also live in California, so maybe the laws are a little different surrounding pepper spray.   If you need to cry, then cry!  But don't be afraid to let yourself relax in the presence of your loved ones! Sending love and support <3",34
mdezvr,To keep it as brief as possible but I'm 31 soon 32 and I have been in constant emotional pain from feeling like I have lost my life. I spent most of my 20s depressed to the point of not being able to function. I was able to do my hobbies and such but if it wasn't Saturday I was largely home with family huddled in my room or on the computer 24/7. Fast forward now I'm a senior in college at 31 now and have been trying to tackle some of my mental health recently. The pain point I'm stuck on now is I'm  literally feeling physical pain from my emotional pain. I don't think highly of myself. I just lost my grandmother and that seemed to have pushed the teetering glass over. I can't stand myself anymore... I know life isn't over but i don't feel like i can every have fun that I could have had. I can't help feeling moving forward nothing I do matters and I'm going to be stuck in this never ending suffering. I am hurting and don't know what to do. A friend of mine is trying to help me but when we finally got down to I basically have to figure it out it basically put me into another set of despair all together that it's like I'm just stuck feeling this way.... All the generic it's never too late or be at my own pace doesn't help anymore. It hurts and hurts and hurts and I can't take it anymore... Suicidal thoughts even came back... I'll never act on them but i don't want to hurt anymore...I just don't...    tl:dr: How can i stop my pain... I don't know what to do anymore..,Sounds so very consuming and painful. I am also  struggling but I am doing it one day at time. I am on medication but I had stop taking it and seems like for some reason they aren’t working.. I suppose It was a big mistake to challenge my illness. Now here I am back at square one   Depression comes with some very negative emotions and irrational thinking. It’s important recognize and debunk them one by one. Eventually we learn not to trust the thought process or the feelings during a crisis. Helps in manage all that pain your feeling. There’s nothing we can do about the time lost. What you can change the time now! Do something about your time now. Take it one step at time. Make the your time count now.,8
mekjcf,Like literally i’m a broke depressed college student with childhood trauma and everyday issues...I cannot reach out for help because one of my many issues are being very financially unstable and these therapists charge so much...like sheesh i didn’t know i had to empty out all my pockets to attempt to find a will to live,"If you don't have an income/low income, you can sign up for state Medicaid.",57
mf6wv3,Does anyone else feel like they’re stuck on a loop with unfortunate events? I keep on going through things every month. It’s very hard to keep up.,"Yes! I feel like life is beating me down, then as soon a I can stand, it beats me down again.",16
mfjny8,my bf recently had panic attack (nothing serious) and he was looking for therapist and he asked about mine.  I honestly don't  want to enlist the same therapist with my bf.  so I didn't tell him about it I just said the location and I didn't mention anything about my therapist but the next morning he called the center and asked which therapist  I'm seeing and he made an appointment without asking me. I was soo beyond my self so I called him and said I feel extremely uncomfortable you seeing my  therapist and now he is pissed off.  I think he really crossed the line... here.. idont know what to do ..,"wait, the people in the center shared the name of your therapist with him? is that legal?",171
mg1yw4,Does anybody understand that?,"I understood that lmao. I admit I did and still tend to have a complex that my words/points aren't fully understood by others. I have social anxiety so this kinda exasperated my worries. This caused me to OVER-elaborate my wording when I communicated to others in fear of the person(s) not fully understanding what I meant. In essence, I sometimes caused even more confusion and confused stares.  Also, I talk VERY fast IRL so sometimes that didn't help things either. I had to work through trying to be ok with simplifying my phrasing more and if misunderstanding still occurs, I'll elaborate more if necessary.",48
mguven,"Basically the title, but I was curious if anyone else has had a hard time with this. It was difficult before to maneuver and articulate my feelings but now with quarantine, I feel like I've gotten a bit worse. I'll discuss issues and events with my therapist and in the moment I'll feel good about them, like I spoke about what I was feeling in an effective manner.  But as soon as I leave or think about it later that day I feel like that wasn't what I was feeling at all, that it wasn't really close enough to count as being honest, or that I was like a different ""me"" in that conversation talking about issues that are only semi-adjacent to what I'm really feeling. I don't know. Definitely bringing it up next session but has anyone else experienced these kind of thoughts or difficulties in their communication? Any tips or tricks that helped you?","I totally know what you mean. I've had this happen to me, too, and not just with a therapist. I've left sessions feeling so much better and thinking like I'm going to be a better person or like that issue that I have about myself has been resolved. Only to be sitting at home a couple of days later realizing I didn't really care about that problem and it wasn't even a problem to me. that my real issue is something else. Or when I talk to people to try to ""explain"" why I had a breakdown or anxiety attack and speaking for hours about it trying to get the words right, realizing it's not coming through and I keep saying the wrong thing. What I do to be better about this: I journal. It sounds stupid and like a nonsolution because everyone says the same thing. But I can assure you that, at least for me, it works. I sit down in front of the computer and ask myself, why did I react that way? Why did I say what I did? What happened? How was I feeling? Why? Just asking myself questions to try to understand it myself first. Recently, I wrote this really long journal entry that I ended up erasing because I reached a point where I thought, wait, I really don't believe this anymore. I'm a different person.  Perhaps, more than journaling, I'm suggesting you just write out your thoughts on the thing, whatever it is. And try to help yourself get to a point where you can find a few words that describe what you feel and why. I do it in different ways. Sometimes it's just like a diary entry, other times I do a dialogue thing. Essentially, I'll be talking to myself, asking myself these questions, trying to see all sides of an issue. This feeling, of not being able to pinpoint the emotion you feel, it's an actual thing. You're not alone in feeling it. I read somewhere that it might come from not learning how to manage our emotions as little kids or seeing adults in our surroundings manage their emotions poorly. Even being forced to repress your emotions and always be a good kid who feels nothing but happiness could make a person skip that part where children are supposed to develop emotional intelligence. I'm not emotionally intelligent. I try and I do succeed in trying to understand them, though. I can't identify them straight away but after some time, I'm able to. I've also noticed that because my vocabulary isn't broad enough, I don't have the exact words I'm looking for. Like, until a few years ago, I didn't really understand what anxiety meant. Now that I do, I can definitely say it is something that I feel. This might not be relevant but I also noticed I told my therapist some things because I was purposefully avoiding talking about an issue I felt ashamed of. But, for the most part, it was an inability to even remember what I felt. It's a high-pressure situation to have a limited time to talk to an expert and you feel like, I need to use this time wisely or it's a waste of time. Maybe journaling before a session or after could help. It certainly doesn't hurt to try :)",8
mhfs0i,"I'm an MSW and LCSW living in Oregon and in October of 2020 I was hired by Better Help to provide on line therapy (right in the middle of the pandemic). I mostly REALLY loved it. It was like doing house calls. I require my patients to have video sessions so I can really assess them and know who I'm talking to. I got to see their pets, their kids and their kitchens and bedrooms. They felt much more comfortable and it gave me a whole new perspective than the one I'd experienced when they came to my office in the past. Most of them were really cool people who worked hard at getting well and I was making a difference. There were a couple of weird things: patients could be anonymous (NOT the community standard of care) and without any contact information. Some patients wanted therapy via chat only. NO But the weirdest thing of all happened about two weeks ago. Here's the language taken from the counselor's handbook.    ""For messaging, any communication that is imbalanced will not be compensated: \* Generally, any words that you write over 2x what the client writes, or any words that that client writes over 2x what you write, are considered imbalanced."" Okay. This includes assessments, post session summary notes, termination notes, psychoeducation notes and notes from a patient that may say ""I feel like giving up"" I have 10 words with which to respond to that or I will be out of compliance and I will not be paid for my work.  It's important to know that these messages are the most utilized method of communicating anything the patient needs you to know between sessions. They are the only way to get important written information to your patient. Now that communication is capped. Phone calls have to be scheduled in advance like appointments. Your patient can't just call you  unless you give them your personal cell. Frowned upon and usually not that great of an idea.  You should also know that there was a not so veiled threat included in prior info from the site that threatened consequences against counselors who did not comply. There was no explanation and no justification for the decision. Yes, I know BH is a money making endeavor that doesn't care about patients but for all I know this is also unethical and against the 1st amendment.  I don't even know who to report this to Cat","I am a therapist on the platform and was shocked by the change to our payment structure.  They made it seem like they would be compensating us more fairly with a new hourly rate, and then they reduced payments for no shows and chat.  So all in all, it feels like there was no change in payment.  It is all so disappointing.",133
mhxlzt,Over the years I [22 F] have spoken with multiple therapists and I’ve discovered that I’ve only really liked the men I’ve spoken with. I wanted to know if any other women experienced this? I almost feel guilty for not liking the women in the field because I feel like it could come from a place of internalized misogyny but I really don’t know.,"Personally, it’s the therapists delivery I am focused on. I’ve had two male therapists, three female ones. Most of them were awful/not my type of therapy!   One male was a lead of the counselling department at a university (lmao not sure how I got sat in front of him) and had over 20 years of experience. I thought he was awful, indirect, and always seemed like he was focused on something else. Alternatively, had a young female (masters) student therapist who would lay out all my shit and sass me back about stuff. I loved and learned so much from her.   Both therapy cycles were grief related, so I’m not sure! I think it boils down to preference and what type of therapy you are looking for. I now know, I need someone who takes a direct, active leading role.  Someone wrote it is histories vs emotions, mmmm. Maybe? But I think it’s all a crap shoot. Once you find one who works well with you, therapy is much easier.",44
mjdgp4,"My therapist diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder (BPD) a couple days ago. I told my family and significant other. I thought they would be supportive, and also just wanted to share that. I had been questioning if I had it for a while.  My family now tells me I am “splitting” whenever someone genuinely upsets me, and my significant other would say the same thing. He also told me when I was upset that it’s my “BPD acting up” I didn’t think they were going to define me by this. It feels extremely bad.","development of BPD is heavily influenced by your childhood relationships and experiences. unfortunately it seems like they are dismissive, invalidating, confusing, and verging on toxic/manipulative. it makes sense that if these are the people that raised you and contributed to your development of BPD that they would act like this - but it doesn't make it okay. i'm sorry that this is happening. try setting some boundaries and definitely explore this with your therapist. it may even be helpful to have your loved ones in session with you every once in a while.",78
mjw3te,Mainly curiosity.,"In my experience moving from depression to, well, not depression, I find that depression is a thing, but health feels more like an absence of that thing, if that makes any sense. Health is being content and having my brain process my experiences with less obsession and drama. I am not constantly happy. Most of the time, I don’t even really think about my feelings at all. I just am, and it’s wonderful! Even when I am sad, angry, furious, indignant, scared, confused, resentful, or otherwise protesting reality, it is so much less exhausting when it’s not being fueled by depression. On the occasions when my depression symptoms come back, like they did the other day, it usually only lasts until I go to bed and sleep it off.",65
mk698b,"Tdlr: Bf gets upset by others during our online gaming every week. I usually try to fix for him to prove my love but I decided to stop people pleasing and let him handle his own problems. I noticed my significant other was being kinda distant since the game we were playing with friends online had finished. He has continuously left the game feeling bad. My instinct is always to “I’m going to fix it for you since you don’t feel comfortable expressing your unhappiness yourself. I’ll talk to them for you.” Because my toxic trait is I love to be a fixer, to prove I deserve love if I help someone else with their problems successfully it means I’m worthy of love! But instead of telling him I’d talk to them for him. I told him “You guys will figure it out.” Giving him the responsibility to take care of his problems instead of taking on for him. He has an issue with learned helplessness where he doesn’t think anything will change if you address the problem when it comes to others behaviors. I know if you don’t try at all nothing will be fixed. But it’s not my job to tell him how to address his problems. If he wants them changed he’s going to have to address them himself. He’s a big boy, he can do it if he really wants it to change or he can let go and stop getting upset when things do go how you think they should. Either way I believe in his ability to figure it out!","You can't imagine the impact this is going to have on your relationship with him if you can keep this up.  He'll likely get perturbed, potentially accuse you of not caring, not wanting to help, not understanding what they're like, etc.  But as long as you can keep in mind two things -- that these accusations come from a place of pain (as opposed to being actual indications of what a terrible partner you are), and that only \*you\* get to decide what you do and don't do for other people, according to your own feelings -- this can be the foundation of a new level in your relationship.  If you decide that you are going to respect your own feelings, no matter what, no matter what he says to you, no matter how you feel -- then you'll no longer see his learned helplessness as a threat (e.g. a looming obligation), you'll see his troubles as \*his\* troubles and not a basis for resentment (again, from the obligation), and he will respect you more, as well, not only for respecting your own feelings, but from the sense that because you are telling him to take care of himself, that must, on some level, be in indication that you believe he can do it (or least start to try).  My only caveat is -- there may be some times you see him really struggling, and you may actually want to help -- we all need a bit of support with our foibles sometimes, so if there are times you actually do want to help him, there's no harm in helping \*if\* you want to; no need to make this newfound autonomy just another rule.   If you act from how you feel, you can't go wrong.   Congrats on this -- literally nothing more important for improving relationships than respecting one's own boundaries and, as a result, keeping at bay the resentment that builds from not doing so.",11
mkj6j6,So therapist and I agreed 7 would work better than later because of my sleep schedule. So 730 comes around and no call. So I text him no answer.  The therapy already hadn't been helping and it was more just a person to talk to which I didn't want. So Instead of waiting around for him to call I said fuck this. I tuned my phone on silent and then the next day I get an email from his company saying to fill out my information with a credit card saying they can charge $70 for less than 24 hr cancelation. Now I had been doing this for 2 months and this is the first I've heard of it. It's supposed to go through my insurance and I think that's the only Information I gave them. So you know what I blocked all the numbers and they can try to get the money from me. Am I in the wrong?,"You’re definitely not wrong to be upset, that’s super unprofessional. My therapist is sometimes a little late for our calls but always let’s me know in advance and I’m p sure it’s usually because she has another client in crisis so it’s not a huge deal for me. Communication is key.  My concern for you here (not sure where you are) is that they could put the outstanding balance into collections and that could really fuck up your credit score. I would suggest emailing the therapist or someone in charge if he works for a larger practice and explain the situation. Then you have a paper trail at the very least.",83

mll8xi,"I’ve had regular Tuesday morning appointments with this great therapist over the last year. Last week he never showed to our appointment. I was frustrated and reached out a few ways and obviously heard nothing. Went into my appointment today and the door was locked with phone numbers of someone to contact. I didn’t make it home before they called and let me know he passed. He was 35 and going through a divorce. I spent the last week thinking I screwed up. Spent this morning thinking it was health related and now wondering if it was suicide and possibly part of my burdens on his shoulders.  They won’t give me any information on what happened and there is nothing in the news or internet. I keep processing it in a way of how I’m going to talk to him about this but of course that won’t happen.  I’m really grateful to have met him and to of had his support over this last year. I’m just lost. He was the one person consistently there for me for this last year.  We spent our last session just bs-ing about working in customer service and life in general laughing as usual and relating. I was a little frustrated that I didn’t quite get the chance to vent. But obviously now I wish we could of talked longer about whatever. I’m limited in options with my insurance and scared to find someone new. I have an appointment with someone who is willing to transition me in two days.  I’m just at a loss. Wish I knew what happened. Wish I had him to talk through this with. Thanks for listening As he would say, take it easy  Edit: thank you for your kind words and support. It felt odd to grieve but he really was important to me. I did search his name for a good two hours and to no avail. I’ve come to the conclusion that most heart attacks happen on Monday mornings, he stated he’d tell me if he ‘was letting me go’ when I pulled away a few weeks ago in fear he was trying to let me off easy. And if it was suicide it wasn’t anything to do with me and yes he is human and life isn’t easy. I got into plants recently and my first was a old reliable pothos. It’s my only hanging plant and I’m already starting to attribute it to him. Really appreciate your support  I really wasn’t sure why I even posted but everyone has been so kind and helpful with words and relating to my situation. I really appreciate the community and today has been much brighter and full of hope. Hope you all are taking it easy!",This is huge- such a destabilizing loss. Therapists write essays about how strange it is to grieve a patient from the shadows- knowing the person well but not part of their real lives. This applies to patients too- this is an important person to you. Maybe try to create a memorial like planting a tree or some other small ritual in his honor to say goodbye?,80
mmgf5x,My good friend is going into therapy for the first time. I've had a wonderful therapist for a few years so I've been trying to convince her to go. She has some pretty dark and sad things from her childhood to process. I've been thinking about how to prepare her to get the most out of therapy and I think the best place to start is knowing who is right for her. How do you make sure your therapist is a good therapist and right for you?,"They let you be you. You feel supported and comfortable enough to just be you. None of the “I’m ok” facade so many survivors of trauma put up on a daily basis. They don’t make assumptions or excuses but rather give ample time and space to get it all out when you want to. My current therapist is a godsend, and I feel like I can share everything with her...even the deepest, darkest parts of me that I keep closed off to the world. (TW: suicidal ideation...For example, because I trusted her enough to share, say, that I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow, I learned about passive suicidal ideation. She didn’t freak out thinking I was going to do something drastic but rather helped me frame a mental though process to be less scary and understandable given what I’ve been through.) I think in many instances, you know whether they’re a fit or not...it’s hard to explain but it’s like your gut knows. My last therapist was bloody awful and I felt like a study subject on child abuse...something felt off and forced before I finally accepted that not all therapists should be therapists. I know some of this is vague, but I hope your friend finds a good match. I’m sure her knowing whatever qualities you like in your therapist will also help her through the process.",21
mn6mxk,"after therapy i realised i could've just given that sign to myself. i could've just said the words i needed to hear, from myself to myself. i want to shout it from the rooftops: i fucking love therapy and it has split my life into before/after. therapy has helped me learn why and HOW i think things and it has only ever helped me. i am becoming the person i idolised when i was a child. i am able to listen to and soothe my inner child when they're crying out for some attention. i've learnt to not shame them for wanting attention (what? a human being wanting some fucking attention?! what a HoRribLe tHiNg /s), and learnt to soothe myself by giving myself attention instead of seeking it from others. i grew up not loving myself, and that was normal because that was all i ever knew, and its black viscous viciousness flowed into so many parts of my life . now, i do. i hope whoever reads this finds a way to solve it, with or without therapy. might be easier with. and have a fabulous day!!",Thank you so much for this.

mo0wx8,"Im 24 male and I have been doing therapy for the past month and I noticed we go over our time limit every time. Like 1h sessions turn into 2hrs on average. I asked her why she gives me the extra time even though I pay have a student discount fee for her sessions. She replied saying that' I need a lot of work and that she wants to help me, that I'm messed up and have a lot of work before I can be of use in this world' My life wasn't perfect, as isn't anyone's but there was no specific reason why I went to therapy. Simply thought I would give it a try to see if anything could be holding me back. I have some anger I would like to sort out, but never considered myself ''messed up'' or ''not of use to the world'. Ever since she got the idea into me I started telling myself that I am broken and messed up and need a lot of help. Which has put me in a bad space. Since that session I have some negative associations and reluctance in attending sessions with her any more. She can probably still help me and do some good, but I don't like how what she said made me feel and believe about myself. My question is, should therapist really tell their clients that their messed up? &#x200B; Edit: FOR EXTRA CONTEXT, the sessions are long but not the whole duration is therapy talk. Anywhere between 30 - 45% would be about random conversations like pets, travelling, life in general and other random things. She says she likes to do that so that her clients get to relax before they properly start on the sessions. Maybe I do benefit from easing into it, but often found it annoying, I find it difficult to be direct and ask her to get back on topic some times as Im afriad to come across as rude. Also, she said I'm messed up on a back of a few things we have uncovered from childhood that I have to work through. Either way she shouldn't say it like that right? ","No. Sweet God, no.  None of those things are okay.  Not what she said, and not that she is giving you extra time.   However, that is my response as someone who doesn't know you and wasn't there. I really want to point out that YOUR body/mind are trying to tell you something.  You are ""reluctant"" to go to sessions. You are posting here to ask if this is okay.  Ask yourself that same question:  is that okay?  Are you okay with her phrasing things that way? Are you okay with her having a clear lack of appropriate therapy boundaries regarding your time and your consent? Only you can answer this, but please listen to yourself above all others.  You are worth much, much more than she seems to think.",69

Reach out to your friends . Reach out to your fiancé’s family ( if you get along with them) they lost your fiancé too. Once you are ready reach out to your therapist if you have one. If you don’t would you consider getting one? Best wishes to you.,44
mpcdj4,"I feel hopeless, lost, alone. I’m codependent. We were together for 12 years. I feel so alone right now. My family is trying to comfort me, friends are there for me. I admitted myself to the ER on Tuesday for suicidal thoughts and depression. I feel like life is not... it’s just horrible right now. I wish I could patch things up with her. I used to make her laugh so damn hard, she told me she’s been unhappy for a while. I feel so wrong for being unhappy.. I have an ok job, a house, a car... but now that she is leaving I feel like half of me is going to be gone. I’m 31, I feel lost right now. She is the love of my life and I don’t want her to go. We work at the same job... well same building. She told me she has felt alone for a long time. I don’t do drugs, or drink..  I have history of depression/mental illness. I hate this. I tell people I can’t afford to be hospitalized because I don’t want to lose my job. Life just feels so pointless right now. I feel so lost.. like I’m navigating through a haze. My mother passed when I was 12 due to cancer, my father was abusive.. my wife brought so much joy into my life. I loved spending time with her. I don’t want her to leave.. she told me she was leaving on Tuesday last week and I told her I wished I was dead.. I didn’t mean it like I would kill myself.. I just l.. there is something wrong with me and I need help. I’m trying to get to therapy twice a week. I’m taking sertraline. I’ve called the suicide hotline to talk and local people trained to help. I’m just so hopeless right now. The pain feels like it won’t go away. I can’t sleep for more than an hour or two before I’m up for the night. I even feel bad for people reading this message.. like I’m a piece of shit. I feel like the biggest piece of shit. I should not have said that to her. I’m sorry.. I really am. I wish I had done all the little things, wish I had been there for her more.  I don’t want her to leave but I won’t try to stop her. I love her so much. I can’t handle the house by myself.. I’m at work and can’t focus. I keep having panic attacks all day. I feel abandoned.. I really do. I feel so abandoned right now. She had mentioned my mental health before. I went to therapy.. it gets a little better.. then i stopped. I am in so much pain right now emotionally and mentally. I only tell people I  feel like living so I don’t get hospitalized. I don’t have a plan.. I just could care less about my life right now. I really could care less. I’m sorry if you’re reading this far.. I’m sorry to everyone I just feel like the worst person. I don’t want to lose her. I want my mom.. I just want my mom to hold me and tell me it will be ok. To take care of me.","If you’re in the US, call a warm line (google them). My favorite is NYC well 1-888-692-9355 24/7 free counseling and peer support. I call them nearly every day.

mpsxxg,"A week-or-so ago, my girlfriend said she was pregnant. I did not want the baby at all and asked for an abortion which she refused. Cue shit hitting the fan. We always wore condoms and she was on birth control so I was wondering how she got pregnant and was thinking crazy things, like was she cheating? When she went to stay at her sisters house, she left her laptop behind and I (this was assholish of me) snooped on her computer and I found evidence of her cheating. So now I am thinking there are high chances the baby is not mine. As a result, I cut her off financially. Now, she is suing me so she can get child support but I am demanding a paternity test, which can be done in a  month and a half-ish, I think. I have been swamped with stress regarding this and the lawyers and everything. Anyway, thanks for listening to me vent.","What the other person said.

mqhmpu,"I’ve been incredibly sad like all day today, and I want to cry, but I literally just can’t?? I almost want to listen/watch something sad just so I can get a cry out. I usually cry a lot but haven’t in two days. Is there something wrong with me, or am I just behaving like a neurotypical? lol","Yep, I went through this a couple years ago. I was going through a tough transition in life and felt so broken and numb. The only person I had was me. I had no one to talk to and no one to figure it all out with. On really hard days, I wanted to cry so bad but I just couldn't. Like you, I resorted to watching sad movies and that helped a bit.  On my 27th birthday, I went to therapy and for the first time in the longest time, I was able to cry FOR me and not because of a movie or song. It felt so natural. Like, my tears just came pouring down. I realized I NEEDED someone to listen to me with compassion. My therapist told me that I was holding so much in and that I needed someone to talk to.  Hope my story helps!",23
mqulwo,"I'm sure this is something thousands (or millions, maybe even billions) of people who struggle with mental illness have already realized, but I *finally* realized that my self talk (which has gotten really, really negative) is like living 24/7 with a bully/abuser. I say such horrible things to myself automatically, and it happens so quickly that I don't know how to counteract it. I can't think fast enough to stop my own thoughts :(.  Makes me feel a little helpless, but also like it's an important epiphany that might finally help me stop the negative self-talk eventually....","It is an important epiphany! Automatic thoughts might never be silenced, but whatever we’re doing to transform them into intrusive thoughts only rewards that voice to keep taking up real estate in our lives. You have agency to choose which of your thoughts you are going to ignore and which you need to invest some time or energy into. It’s a skill that needs to be practiced and trained over time, but you are capable of it. I hope that helps somehow.",45
mrcw50,"Basically, my university has this free counseling/mental health service where trained professionals talk to students and since I can't afford actual therapy I, on an impulse, decided to schedule an appointment. This is the first time I am ever seeking help for my issues, and I always thought that they were not severe enough to be addressed. But after some deliberation and reading about mental health online, I just decided to go for it and get some professional help. I have not harmed myself a lot in the past but sometimes when I feel too angry, I cut my arm (not to the point where it bleeds so it's not that bad) I also think about dying often, although I am too afraid to actually do it. Anyway, let's get to the point. He begins by asking me what my problem is/what I wanted to talk about. Now I didn't have a prepared answer because I deal with a lot of issues, and one of the main things that I deal with is loneliness. So when he asked me that, I said I really just needed to talk to somebody since I don't have many people to talk to. To this he said, rather sarcastically, that I cannot just schedule an appointment when I need someone to talk to as he has a lot of other students to take of. This is when I started to regret ever trying this out. After that, I had lost all interest in telling him anything but he still kept asking me questions. I found myself exaggerating my problems because I felt like me asking him for help was not justified after what he said to me. I told him I hurt myself, which I do, but I did find myself exaggerating a little just to feel like I deserved help. I feel so torn and invalidated. I found myself thinking I was right all along to have never tried therapy before. In the end, he also asked me if I am planning to kill myself, which I am not, and if I am he is gonna tell the police. I was so scared by this point, and about to cry because of how overwhelmed I felt. Maybe he meant well with that last comment but it sure sounded like a threat. Anyway, safe to say, I will not be trying this again. I'll just have to learn how to deal with my mediocre problems by myself.  Edit; wow I didn't think so many people would read this. Thank for you understanding, I feel much better now. I'll definitely try to keep an open mind about therapy from now on. Thank you❤️❤️","I am so sorry this happened to you. This is NOT okay, and this is not how therapy goes. I want you to know you have other affordable options available to you and you are not limited to this person. There are many resources now for effective therapy.  I always tell everyone this, therapy is for YOU.  My boyfriend had tried multiple therapists with terrible experiences so he never saw the point. I kept encouraging him, promising that you’re supposed to *like* your therapist, so he tried one more time and landed one he loves. I promise they’re out there.

mslfo7,"love my parents very much but I feel my father never really taught me the how part when he talks to me. He always told me to defend myself but not how. He’ll tell me you have to talk to girls but not how. To stand up for my self and for what’s righteous but not how. To be kind to others but not how to talk to them but says he knows how to talk to people but why not teach me. To not let people walk over you and to stand up for my self but not how to do it. To keep good grades but never set a standard to what good grades were and it could be a D that’s good to him. He blames me for not knowing what to do and blame me for my choices in life and says I should had done better raising myself. My mom and dad always told me to do this but never actually told me the basics on how to deal with this situation. My mother was actually quiet. It’s feel like they threw me out into the wolves of life accept they can say they took care of me. But I feel that’s not enough as a parent. Always telling me laugh of the people picking at you and don’t pay bullies no attention until they put they hands on me was not telling me on how to deal with them. Telling me to be kind is not teaching me how. It’s like my father did what he said he would do always be there in my life and make sure me and my sister had food, clothes ,and shelter because he been a orphan since he was 14(he’s 73 now). So since he didn’t have it he made sure we had it to survive. But i felt like it was something missing. I look at how other kids are. My friends who take no bs to my gf who is so nice was taught to be like that. Or maybe I never listened. My dad wasn’t taught how neither even as him being a orphan his dad was still around but he was a drunk and never taught him non neither. If I was to have a child one day I’ll teach him everything I learned for my self but not at my age right now he wouldn’t learn nothing(I’m 21) and I wouldn’t know how to be a parent. I wonder is it better to have a kid when your 30 or 40 to be a better teacher for them then being a young parent that don’t know non about the world and how it works.","You're pretty much correct in everything here.  You father didn't teach you the ""hows"" because, being an orphan, he never had a father to teach HIM the ""hows"". But luckily, it's never too late to learn. You've just got to find some teachers. I was at the same place at 17: realized everything I'd learned about life from was family was just WRONG. I needed to wipe the slate clean, start again, and figure out the right way. So I looked around for the people who I felt were living their lives the right way, and I made them my mentors. I studied them, but I also asked them a lot of questions: about life, about how they handled things, about how they saw the world. Good people are always willing to talk about their lives to people who ask sincere questions. Don't be afraid to tell someone ""I'd like to learn how to be more like you. Can we talk about how you go about living your life?"" Obviously, you'll have to work down to specifics, but trust that people will be willing to share. And you're also correct you'll be a better parent once you have your feet better planted under you. Parenthood works better as a challenge for what you've learned rather than a learning experience for the uninitiated. So wipe the slate and find some mentors. Be willing to learn, be willing to throw away ideas that don't work when better ones come along, be willing to try stuff, fall on your face, try again until it works. It is never too late to become the person you want to be. And it's a noble pursuit, well worth every effort you make. Good luck.",6
mswe3q,"So I’ve been going to therapy and now since it’s through zoom, my therapist has shown little to no professionalism.

mumsc7,"I had a psychotic breakdown in 2018, and after mental hospital and some antpsychotics I resumed my hectic life scedule.  About a year ago I started hearing a voice that would repeat things like, ""Please... please... please"" or ""Help me"" or ""I love you"" over and over. About two weeks ago it started speaking full sentences, where previously I tried to hear what it was saying but only heard mumbling without clear words. So I went to my psychiatrist to update my meds. I told her about the voice and she prescribed 4x the initial dose of antipsychotics. She also changed out my antidepressants to a more OCD focussed one. Since I started on the meds the voice has gone quiet. Before the change it was like I was still living in a kind of fog, not completely in reality. I mean now that I'm fully in reality I cant believe I've been living on the edge of it ever since my breakdown. I also had this epic feeling of anxiety and dread 24/7 up until they changed my meds. If I was better able to relay what I was feeling at the time of the breakdown they could probably have fixed my problem much sooner. Also reality isn't as scary as I thought. When I slip into non-reality, that is essentially a defence mechanism where I dissociate from reality since I cannot mentally survive the cold truth of it, or that is basically what I was programmed into doing after suffering trauma in my childhood developmental years. I dissociated from my surroundings into a much better world, and in this way I could survive. This defence mechanism still kicks in when I get triggered. I got badly triggered and fell into a psychotic state, i. e. mental breakdown. I just remember being terrified beyond anything I could imagine, and not being able to come back into reality. I couldn't understand what was wrong with me and how something simple could send me into such a complete state of panic. Long story short. Meds and therapy fixed me, and I'm now really balanced. Take yer meds. :p","Meds can help when you find a doctor that will listen. Unfortunately most know what they are going to prescribe even before they meet you. I was getting therapy and considered meds until I realized everyone received the same medications from the doctor despite having a wide variety of symptoms and challenges. I'll stick to yoga, meditation, and supplements, but I'm happy for you. Hopefully the effects are lasting.",23

mvk6w3,"I know it’s not totally ethical for me to have a personal issue while having a session, but it happened so quick and I didn’t want to cancel last minute. It was a phone session and I was able to completely understand my client and help....all while crying for 50 minutes. I wasn’t thinking about my own situation, and I cry easily, so I guess it’s possible for me to compartmentalize even while allowing myself to cry.","I see both sides of the coin. On one end you were there for your client and you listened and helped and allowed yourself to be vulnerable - which in turn could make them more comfortable being vulnerable. But - on the other side, I've had a therapist before that broke down crying when I shared something I'd never shared before (also it was at our first session) and it made me feel really guilty. I felt like I had to turn around and start comforting her. I already had significant problems with feeling like I was a burden so in my mind I just upset someone by being vulnerable and it made me close off to being vulnerable again for a long time.  I would suggest checking in with your supervisor (maybe also getting your own therapy to help you process) and also checking in with the client to make sure they're okay",71
mx7dbp,"The title sounds really really bad, I know, but there's more to it. It's not because I have some weird superiority complex that I need to feed, I swear. It's that I have severe social anxiety, and it would seem that people who I subconsciously perceive to be worse than me (in some significant way, or in general) make me subconsciously feel like I don't need to concern myself with whether or not I'm a utility to them somehow. For example, I play a lot of shooter games, and I had a friend named dizzy who I've been playing with for a good couple of months. He's nice, and alright at the game, but I never got over my social anxiety with him. Every time he talks my brain freezes, and everytime I say something, I 2nd guess it and think I sound like an idiot even tho weve interacted almost every day for months. Later on tho, he introduces me to a friend of his named Max. Max is also a super great person, but he's kind of butt at the game, which is really putting it mildly. For some reason, even tho I've known him way shorter, I don't feel anxious around him at all. It's like my brain knows that if I say something stupid, he won't care, or im not at risk of being evaluated over it, and because of that, I end up not saying stupid stuff, which makes it even better. I don't understand at all. Before I posted this, I did a lot of introspection trying to figure out why my brain sometimes makes me immune to anxiety with only a very few certain people, and the first paragraph is what I came up with. I want to know if therapy can possibly make me feel this way with everyone, because right now, there's only 3 people (well call them Max, Marvin, and Dan) in the entire world that I feel this way with, and I literally (yes, literally) need to stop, close my eyes, and desperately try to tell my brain that ""I'm talking to Marvin"" to try to feel comfortable around people who aren't them. Also, for a bit more context, the anxiety I have around other people really is bad. it's just not a slight, but appreciated comfort gain when I talk to these people. It's like I can only talk like myself around them, and otherwise struggle to even produce a simple sentence. It's so significant that around them, I don't even recognize myself because of how different I sound, and how different it feels in my head to suddenly not be anxious. I didn't know any of them before 2017, and before that, I hadn't had a single non-anxiety ridden conversation for over a decade. Didn't even know it was possible to have one for me","What are the odds I come across a post like this. I kid you not I just came to the same realization very recently. This is gonna sound bad, but back in high school I would sometimes hang out with the ""weird"" kids, some of which I didn't like, simply because I felt comfortable and confident around them. That's just one example.  But on the other hand, nowadays if I were to interact with a guy who is my age and maybe good looking or seems well off, for some reason I become more anxious. I think whether I like it or not I subconsciously compare myself to people I interact with. And the amount of anxiousness I have in those moments depends on how I perceive them in contrast to myself.",48

I tried to explain to him that I need to see proof of him getting his shit together before I make that move, otherwise I’m too afraid I would be screwing myself over. He blew up on me, and managed to genuinely make me feel it is my fault he has not been able to keep a job because he is too “lovesick” to work (because I will not make big life moves with him).

I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this, so I sincerely appreciate any honest input.","drop his ass first. if he’s telling you that you’re the problem, chances are that HE is the problem. and from what i read, he is. not only should he not make you feel like him not getting a job is your fault. the lovesick excuse being ridiculous. but he shouldn’t give you an ultimatum when your reasoning is perfectly understandable. you’re perfectly in the right to want to wait for him to be financially stable to move in with him. he’s wrong for making you feel like it’s your fault. so i say, drop his ass. you deserve better than a mentally abusive bf.",188
myco61,"I grew up a Jehovah Witness and otherwise alone most of my childhood and now as a 23 year old adult I don't know how to maintain relationships.

I've never really had a set friend group and whenever I get one I never really get to hang out with them, usually because I have to work and I feel like I'm an outsider to them.

myw4rl,"I started therapy a bit more than 1 month ago. By now I've learnt SO MUCH about myself that sometimes I have a feeling that I can't handle it.  I thought my abused childhood is long time gone -- it isn't and it affects my everyday life, my anxieties, emotions and relationships with people. There's truly a sack of things to unpack and if earlier I ignored them or wasn't even aware of them, now they are all in front of me lit like pictures in a museum. I'm psychologically and emotionally overwhelmed, I just want to cry and pity myself... Is there even a way out of this state of mind?..","everyone has bad things in life they try and sweep under the rug, but realizing they're part of your life and helped shape you into who you are today is a great start to acceptance. Let yourself cry for a bit, but then pick yourself back up and see how strong you are. Realizing the connection between your experiences and the behaviors that arose from it is very hardy and overwhelming, but when you learn to own them and be proud of yourself no matter what you've gone thru you'll be in a better spot.

mz7xry,"I've been with my therapist for over a year and a half now, and it's been immensely beneficial. I know that it's easy to get carried away by emotions and mess up therapeutic dynamics by trying to be their friend/trying to impress them/etc. As a result, I've been mindful to uphold therapeutic boundaries, which helps me be fully honest, unfiltered and clear about my thoughts and emotions, knowing that it's a space dedicated to processing them in a structured way without fearing judgment/disapproval.  My therapist, to their credit, has also been exemplary and has struck the right balance of warm, caring yet impersonal cordiality and empathy when required. Progress has been steady, and I certainly look forward to our sessions every week. Recently they've had to cancel some sessions because of pandemic related emergencies. They've assured me that they'll accommodate me as soon as possible, which is honestly far from my concerns right now. I obviously understand the situation at hand right now, and don't mind resuming at a more convenient time. I feel compelled to ask if they're doing alright and if they'd like to take more time when they do schedule me next. However, I'm not sure whether that would be fully appropriate from my end, and am wondering if that would infringe on their therapeutic boundaries. At the same time, I find it unconscionable on a general, humane level to not at least make the slight gesture from my end in these sort of times, especially considering that they do play an important(albeit indirect) role in my life and that I've seen them regularly for so long now. Can someone offer their perspective here?",I think in this situation it would be considered considerate rather than inappropriate. In your attempt to remain as professional as possible don’t forget that being kind is perfectly fine.,71
mzk8pe,"So, I have been going to a therapist for a whopping two sessions (I know, yay me, I really tried), and something that's occurred to me is that none of it is real.  Like, when you have a physical problem, you go to the doctors and they help you using the power of science. Therapy doesn't seem like science to me. It feels more like just aimlessly wobbling around with a broken leg until wow it just magically gets better one day.  Cynicism aside, I really do want to stop feeling like I'm at the mercy of my own brain. Like, I just don't understand how talking about the fact that I feel like I want to cry is going to help me from not wanting to cry in the future. Is it just for coping then?? Is therapy like antibiotics where it just helps the symptoms sometimes but not the real problem? That's what mental health meds feel like to me. I wanted therapy to be the cure.  I feel very hopeless honestly. I want to get better. Getting to the point where I made a therapy appointment was huge. And now I just don't feel like I'm cut out for it. I open up a zoom camera and put on some happy go lucky business professional facade and proceed to say all the things you are supposed to say in public about mental health. I know this isn't going to help me. And I know this is the only way I know how to talk to other human beings. So what do I do from here? I have an intense fear of authority. Which is pretty ironic when trying to talk to someone who's much older and medically qualified. My previous experience with talking with school counselors was traumatic and to put it simply, bad. So now I don't feel like talking to people about things. I don't like to burden people. I don't want my feelings rubbing off on everyone around me.  Therapy was the last thing I said I'd try before simply throwing the towel. I know I only went for two sessions. The third session I just couldn't get up from bed. Now I'm too nervous to email my therapist saying I don't feel like making this next meeting too. Wow. I just had a series of like ten different emotions writing this.  Isn't therapy just you helping yourself? I've been trying that for my whole fucking life. I just need some relief. I can't keep feeling like I'm being tortured by my mind.  As someone who has no idea what they are doing in this world, I'm asking for some advice. Do I continue therapy? Is there anything else I can do? How long until I can stop feeling like shit?  I don't feel anything from it. My therapist asked if it helped and I lied and was like ""yes I feel much better! Much less anxious!"" like what was a supposed to say? No?? Like damn now I have to wonder about the social rules and social cues while going through it and pretty soon wow it's exactly like I'm talking to my boss at work. Maybe my problem is that I'm a compulsive liar when it comes to wanting to make others feel better.  Because the therapist is a person. I need to treat them kindly. And treating people kindly does not include pouring all my trauma and anxieties onto them. I don't get any of this. It doesn't make sense to me at all. It feels like a self help scam or something.  Fuck I don't know. I just want to get better and I don't know how.  To whoever made it this far, I'm sorry I put you through reading that. I really hope you have a good day.  Edit: Wow, thank you all for these responses. I did not expect to get so many or for this post to blow up. I've been reading through all of them and appreciate each and every one- you've all convinced me to stick with therapy. I've got a session today that I was feeling like skipping, I think I'm going to go now. Just from reading these replies, the concept of therapy makes more sense to me now. I wish I could give you all a hug- here's a digital hug instead 🤗","I understand your frustration.  Unfortunately, the human brain is astonishingly complicated in itself, and in comparison to other organs as well. Also throw in the fact that the science behind psychological well-being is relatively young (150 years or so), so it is still developing every year at a fast pace. There are so many things we still don't know and results we cannot reliably replicate.  You are right about one thing: **the therapist is merely a facilitator**. They are an expert who guides you, but any healing comes from inside yourself. Why? Because **the brain can change itself, unlike other organs**. The physical process is called **""neuroplasticity""**. Look it up, it is a fascinating topic. If the therapist is skilled and understands what the patient should change in themselves, and the patient is willing to work hard, they can achieve success together as a team. That's why psychologists talk about ""therapeutic alliance"". But the real work is on your shoulders. Psychological healing is a lot like learning. In fact, it **is** learning: it is the process of unlearning old unwanted patterns of feelings, thoughts, behaviors, and learning new, more satisfactory, ones. It resembles the work you have to put in when you learn to play a musical instrument, or a new job, or a new language. I hope it makes more sense now.",98
mzygqq,"I'll do my best to not make this too long. So here's the gist: I started going to therapy about 9 months ago since I'm fortunate enough to have insurance to make it be affordable. It's been a wonderful experience, has helped me immensely, and I LOVE my therapist.  Since the beginning of the year my therapist has let me know he plans on opening his own private practice. I let him know what insurance I was on and he said he'd look into the paperwork for it and it was kind of left at that. He was originally supposed to transfer to his new practice at the end of May, but last week I was informed it was going to be end of April instead. Come to find out there's been some sort of drama where his boss basically said that it needs to happen now for reasons I'm not privy to. The session following the news last week was chaotic and confusing and left me trying to figure out what exactly was going on and what that meant. When I initially found out I wasn't worried since I knew this was happening, but in our session he broke the news to me that I'm the only client he has with my insurance and that with everything going down now it's not something he's going to be sending in, making this next session the last that my insurance will cover. I feel like the rug has been swept out from under me and I don't really know what to do. I'm mad that I've ended up being caught up in some internal work place drama and left having to figure out what to do next. Both my therapist and his soon to be former boss have offered to help me find another therapist, or he's offered me 10 sessions at a discounted rate (still significantly more expensive than what I pay currently) until we can get things figured out. I don't know which option I should choose. I hate the idea of our relationship ending so suddenly with virtually no warning and starting all over with a new person, but I also don't know if I feel like I want to continue investing emotionally into this if it's just going to end anyways not on my terms or when I'm actually ready for it. Plus this has brought on its own loss of trust. I feel hurt, I feel sad, I feel angry, and I don't really know where to go from here.",Ask them for a 3 session package and use it as your debriefing time with this therapist. This will help you ease out a little more seamlessly.,28

Original Post Below: Finding a therapist was super intimidating for me at first and when I was extremely depressed, figuring out how to find a therapist was next to impossible. Now that I'm in a better place, I really enjoy helping people find the help they need by clearing away the confusing parts about therapy specialties, insurance, etc, etc. I'm a 26-year-old man who has gone through the therapist search process a handful of times personally and for several friends.

You can stay anonymous during our conversations, but as a rule, I will keep anything you tell me confidential. Our process will look something like this: 1. Search for therapists with your criteria (insurance/no insurance, male/female therapists, geographic distance, etc) 2. Put a list of potential therapists together 3. Leave a bunch of voicemails (don't worry, we'll do a bunch together or I can tell you what you need to say) 4. Wait for callbacks and schedule first appointments DM me two or three sentences about you and if I have the time, I'll reach back out.

n0lcc9,"I really don’t know if this is the right sub for it or not? I have an issue where I feel the pain of other people like it’s my own. I feel terrible when something bad happens to one of my friends, I get way too emotional over losses suffered by strangers, by fictional characters. By people I care nothing about. Today, my best friend was really low and not himself and I could tell that he was in pain. I couldn’t stop crying for the whole time I was speaking to him, why is it that I feel other people’s pain so very intensely?",I think its called being an empath. I get that same way too.

n178sd,"I didn’t get these words from my parents, yes, but I say them to myself all the time. So I thought I knew and believed these things about myself. Soooo when others say it to me, why does it still kinda break me down and make me tear up? Am I just an emotional person or lol is more therapy in order EDIT: Honestly guys, even some of these responses are making me tear up. So, I think it's a combination of the validation (being seen, understood and still cared for despite not meeting the standards I set for myself/my parents set) which I haven't received very much from others. Maybe also because of my parent's reactions to not meeting certain standards also lives on in how I speak to myself, even though I thought I was effectively fighting those past voices. So when someone is kind and gentle, it further confirms that I didn't need to be treated that way to excel. And though I had hoped it was enough to give it to myself, it definitely is fulfilling a need that I probably also need from others.","It's because you're not used to hearing it from people outside of you, you needed to hear it, you're not used to others speaking so kindly to you and showing you that type of support. When others tell you this you feel more seen and understood. One day it won't make you tear up because you believe them when they tell you, know they're being sincere, and will realize how much strength it gives you to hear it so you'll start doing it to others. This is growth.",34
n1n54j,"Suicide Warning.... I don't know how to put this, but I've been a failure. I failed to make myself happy, my parents, or even my society. A gay person like me living in Egypt is a tough task to pull off each single day. the moment I got out of the closet to my parents, the same moment they hated me to the guts. they don't show it, but pushing me to stay home 24/7, not meeting anyone, and not visiting friends, under any circumstances. The only true relationship I had (16 years old) was with my school buddy, the bully, I felt obedient to him, I liked it, and was exploited in return. he filmed and blackmailed me, that's why I told my parents about my nature. they ended the situation peacefully, but I'm their prisoner now. When I raged and told them that I'm 22 years old now, and I can move into my own place, they simply told me that they will go to the police saying that I'm gay, and that's alone can put me in jail. police in a country like Egypt is very vicious, they truly treat parents like gods. or if the life was a bit merciful, I'll go to homotherapy in a local hospital, to be locked in a small room with patients; real sick people with real medical conditions. I have diabetes 2, I tried to overdose the sugar once, a big tart with 2 liters of Pepsi. tried to induce a coma, but I failed, miserably. just found myself on the floor, covered with cream, and totally pathetic. In the eyes of the society, I'm a successful man, having a good job, staying with a well-educated parents, and maintaining a good reputation so far. but in fact I'm a prisoner, they are holding me hostage.

n2dy5y,"I am twenty-two years old, a female. I'll mention that I have maladaptive daydreams since I was four or five and had limerence in the past. So I do daydream constantly and can be too attached to real people. I had unrequited love, no friends, been bullied, misunderstood, and past regrets throughout my school years. My family can be emotionally abusive, brushing off my issues and argue with me when I mention them. My first real relationship lasted a year, he was amazing and he loved me despite my issues but we went our separate ways during the pandemic. I've had a little crush on fictional characters before but this is different. Since I discovered this character last year it's hard to not think about him every day. It brings me comfort and happiness when I think about him like I am not alone despite being alone.  That is the problem, I am getting too comfortable and attached to the character. I've been trying to find friends and even a partner online, so I can be normal instead of dreaming of a romance. Sadly, most guys I met want sex, it pushed me farther away from every guy in fear of being used or abused, the nice guys don't understand me or leave after a few days. When I mentioned limerence, this happened before I met my Ex, I was too obsessed with a man who didn't and couldn't even love me. That experience left an impact on me, it made me not want to fall in love for fear of being that obsessed again. I would never want to put anyone through that. When I see the fictional character, he makes me feel good, a person I can look up to and who won't leave or hurt me.  When I talk to real men, I don't feel anything towards them. Maybe a little uncomfortable, cautious, and expecting the person to get perverted during the conversation. I am bad at making conventions. My social skills are nonexistent, I have social anxiety, I am not good at talking to strangers. Which makes it more difficult to talk to real people.  So after what I've experienced and been through, I fell in love with a fictional character, it hurts to admit it but I am. Is there a way I can overcome it? I want to find love and have a family someday. I don't want this to get in the way of finding real love.","I’ve had this same thing happen to me before, man. Constantly thinking about em, called off a date with a real girl cause I was thinking about this character, etc. I treated it just like I would a crush on anyone you knew you just couldn’t have, and eventually got over it. I wouldn’t worry too much OP, although if it’s been going on for a really long time then you might wanna chat with a therapist about it! I wish you the best <3",29
n3g7bi,"So last year May, I was hospitalized for substance abuse at an inpatient psychiatric treatment center. Whilst there, I (19F) met an addictions counselor (37M), and instantly, I felt as though we had a connection. He would leave flirty comments on my assignments, and would seemingly become jealous whenever I would interact with another male patient, and openly disliked my boyfriend at the time. &#x200B; After I left the center, we friended one another on social media and began chatting outside of sessions. We started talking on the phone, and the conversation became more mutual and casual. He would often check up on me, and over time, I recognized that I was falling in love with him. &#x200B; I was readmitted to another treatment center last year July, a place that I specifically chose because I knew that he worked there once a week. I would anxiously and excitedly wait for this day to arrive and would spend extra time making myself look better, in anticipation of his arrival. We would sit together before and after groups, and have a cigarette together, and talk about what was going on for us. In groups, he began referring to me as his girlfriend and would make a conscious effort to sit next to me. We began saying that we loved each other every time that we saw one another, he commented on my appearance, told me that my hair smelt nice when we would hug, and he began talking about getting ""hard-ons"" etc, which other patients overheard, and commented on. At this point, I had fallen in love with him. &#x200B; After leaving treatment again, we began seeing each other over the weekend, where he would pick me up from my house, and later drop me off. We would always spend extra time in his car, and I could almost feel the anticipation in the air, but I would always become awkward and flustered before anything happened, something that he laughed about. We spoke about going out together, but soon after I relapsed, and we stopped talking. &#x200B; We recently got back in touch, and I invited him to my apartment with the intention of having sex, but got cold feet at the last moment, as I wasn't entirely sure he felt the same way. About a week ago, my suspicions were confirmed, after I asked him if he would help me break out of my parent's house, to which he responded ""we can first have sex in the car and then run away together"" &#x200B; I am still in love with him and want to have sex with him, but don't know if any boundaries are really being crossed if we engage in a relationship.",Soooooo many boundaries are being crossed.

n42ir5,"Music has always been my favorite thing ever, my medicine and my escape. But i’ve also always felt a lot of defensiveness because of that? Like i won’t show music to other people because i’m afraid that they’ll taint what it means to me. And usually when i do, it does get tainted and idky This is especially the case with people i don’t want to be thinking about, like say an ex. Once they’ve mention a song or an artist or even a genre, my brain can’t help but make me think of them every time i hear it even on my own, even years later. Live music too; a concert with 100,000 people at it won’t be enjoyable if i know that an ex is in the crowd somewhere.  This has been happening for my whole life, it’s an embarrassing problem cuz i feel like an A-hole and idk if it’s a normal thing or not. Somehow i’ve conditioned myself into such intense self sabotage like this that every song/artist reminds me of someone i’d rather not think of and thus nothing makes me feel anything anymore.  How do i undo this? How do i rethink, or retrain my brain into being okay and enjoying music again","I'm also a music lover and I understand how personal and vulnerable it can be.  Instead of thinking about this as about music,  it may be helpful to think of it as energy put into stuff you can't control.  No matter what you do , or how upset you are about this, it simply won't change.  And worse,  it allows other people to control your feelings. Other people will continue to have their own personal relationships with your favorite songs and artists. And of course,  this won't change or invalidate your experiences. There are lots of things you can do. How much time do you spend on this? Maybe you can set a timer and let yourself be upset for a certain amount of time every day. Then,  slowly reduce that amount of time by 5% every day or every week. You can start using existing coping skills (or build new ones ) to deal with the negative feelings.",12

n5m0ut,"Here’s a synopsis of what happened: (1) I was highly suicidal and most therapists refused to see me and recommended that I be hospitalized. (2) my now-ex-therapist accepted me and offered to see me at a fraction of what she charges other patients. (3) almost 2 years later, I’m at a much better place and she knows that, too. We’ve been seeing each other once a week without a fail. No doubt, she’s a great therapist and helped me immeasurably. (4) In February of 2020, I get a job with health benefits and she tells me that she accepts my new insurance. I give her the info. (5) 1 year and 3 months have passed since I’ve given her the new insurance information. (6) she calls me on Monday, saying that actually, it’s not the type of insurance she accepts (she accepts a different plan my health insurance company offers) and that she’s not gotten paid for a single session from February of 2020. (7) she admits her fault and asks me to pay for Jan-April 2021 fees with discount (~$1000). She says that since it’s her fault, she’ll regard last year’s work as pro-bono. (8) I send her the money right after the call. (9) she calls me again today, asks that I pay the co-pay I should’ve paid even if she accepted the insurance (=$680 total). I am going to pay her the $680 she asked for. She deserves that for she saved my life. But she asked me to find another therapist and to not hurt myself because of this.

Is this really it?  I was expecting that this would bring insight and help me understand perhaps either the subconscious or brain pathways and networks better. I don’t need to spend $180 a session to be told how to calm down and gain perspective about how this too shall pass, both things I already know and do when I become very upset. If anybody else feels this way about therapy, it would be great to hear! All my friends who are in therapy love it, but when they share their experiences it seems very similar to my own, just with a sense of satisfaction for the quality of treatment they’re receiving. If I’m not getting the right kind of treatment and you know therapy is way more than telling your brain to stop being emotional, I would love to know, too!","Therapist here. CBT can be a useful therapy for some people, but not everyone. I personally loathe how much it is being overused right now for a myriad of reasons.  From the list of things you want in a therapeutic experience I would recommend looking for a therapist who is well versed in existential therapy, internal family systems, or EMDR. All three of those are very different therapy techniques so definitely check them out and see if any of them feel right. Some therapists are trained in all 3 but, I wouldn't hold my breath for that. Also there are other kinds of therapy that could fit too, those are just the ones that come to mind for me.",79
nbek12,It’s my first time ever in my life to do this. Not sure what to expect or even what to say! It’ll be only 1-1.5 hours for that session and I’m afraid it’s not enough to cover what I want to express. Feeling excited yet seriously nervous.,The first session is very introductory. Your T is just going to learn about you and let you talk about whatever is going on that brought you there. You made a great decision in doing this. Everyone needs therapy IMO. Take care.,18
nbywv0,"But I know that's not true. The truth is that I feel like no one likes me even when I'm really trying my best to form a connection with them. I feel very socially flawed and that no matter how much I try, no will will like me. I know that I have a hard time expressing myself, but I dont feel like anyone cares about me enough to help me or give me a chance. One part of me wants to reject everyone, but another part of me wants to keep trying. I cant help but feel like there are too many things wrong with me before anyone can actually and truly like me. And I tell myself that I hate everyone because why can't anyone just give me a chance? Why can't anyone give me the patience to try?","Is it at all possible that people like you just about as much as people like most people? And that the people who are satisfied with how liked they are possibly just accept the level of acceptance you are currently capable of as enough for them? I try to focus on what brings me joy other than relationships, and then enjoy when relationships come and go from my life as I meet and get to know the people who share my interest in those things.",13
nc6jv8,"Have you guys ever read Lovecraft? A major trope in his stories is the main character learning or realizing something so terrible that the simple act of enlightenment makes them go insane. That’s close to how I’m feeling right now. I’ve connected dots that I didn’t know existed, I’ve discovered facts that I could not have imagined and I’ve come to acknowledge terrible truths that I had so deeply repressed. The protective shell of a perspective that I had built is collapsing and I’m coming to realize how much I hate this life. I need to abandon my parents, my friends, my country and if absolutely necessary even my girlfriend (the only thing tethering me to my current life). I’m glad I made these discoveries early, but I’m seriously depressed at how terrible things really are.  Anyone else on the same boat? Anyone else got fucked by therapy, but in a good way? I feel like I took the matrix red pill (not the alt right way obviously).","Yes. Completely. The reason I'm so fucked up now is because of how much therapy has opened my eyes. But we can't back down now. An ex of mine used to tell me that our minds are like a room. When you start therapy, you realize your room is arranged in a certain way, but you have to disorganize everything to re-arrange it in a better way. Right now we're in the middle of disorganizing everything, and seeing the mess we've made is really really hard. But eventually we'll put stuff in order. Trust the process.",132
ndmxnq,"For me, cheating is not about the mere sexual act, but mostly about all the lies, the schemes and the everlasting trust issues that causes to the other person. I was cheated on and lied to in the past, and it caused me severe trust issues, so now I can’t trust people who cheats me or other people, and who believe that cheating is in any way okay.  My therapist said instead that cheating is somehow normal, that is something that can happen and that it’s not a crime, so I can’t look at her the same way now.  We’ve been discussing about it a lot, but we seem to be stuck in our respective positions.  So I’m wondering if I better leave her and find another therapist.","When I disagree with my therapist, he asks me why and challenges my beliefs. We then both agree and go over what I want and what my bounderies are, and then he challenges me to stick to them. His goal is to make sure that I do not create cognitive dissonance for myself. So if I let someone walk all over me he will do his best to help me rediscuss what my priorities and beliefs are. I hope that helps.",108

I don’t care to be called strong because there are 100 other ways to develop that quality without having to live my life feeling scared, ashamed, unloved and etc. What good does it do to be called a survivor, like it’s some badge of honor? I guess I’m weird.... I’m sure everyone else is fine and feels comforted by it?",What would you prefer the experience to be called? Language is unfortunately limited at describing complex experience but there’s not a lot else out there.

nelio2,"I’ma 16 year old female. Every single time I try to ask my parents to go out with my boyfriend or go out with a new friend I cry. I also cry when talking to them about how I really feel which i’ve only done like once. I have practiced having these conversations in my head and I start crying everytime or i’m on the verge of crying.  I can’t help it. I am sensitive as it is, at first I thought it was my period (which does indeed make me way more sensitive then I am and I have gotten depression from it) but I have started to realize no matter what day of the month it is I can’t talk about my emotions to anybody for that matter. I also really love my boyfriend and if i talk about how much i love him i will have another breakdown. Also last time I asked my parents to hang out with him I started crying and when I went into my room.. i couldn’t breathe. I felt suffocated and began hyperventilating. This is also why I come off as mean a lot because if i try to be nice or if i try to express how i feel for anybody like i’d i admire them i will end up being mean to them because i’m afraid if i try and show them how i really feel i’ll have a breakdown. This is a big problem for me and i don’t know how to fix it. Even as i am writing this without looking anybody in the eyes or having to get the words out of my mouth I can’t stop crying Edit: i just wanted to say i am really thankful for everybody who is sharing their experiences on here It is helping me a lot to know more people are out there who are dealing with this. Please continue to share! I have read every single one.","When it comes to certain things I’m passionate about or feel insecure about them I’ll get emotional when speaking of them with my mom. Even the thought of speaking about them with my mom is triggering.

nfcrgw,"sorry for formatting I am on mobile maybe one day I can afford laptop or something ha Ok so Two years ago my ex who was struggling with gender dysphoria was seeing this great therapist so I made an appointment. I have very bad anxiety especially in social situations so it's hard for me to talk to people but I pushed myself to do it.  We got a little too close She would talk to me about her problems and mine She would tell me about my BF and if he was threatening me or what was going on (long story short we were in a lawsuit over my previous home ) She introduced me to her family Had me.over for dinner Cooked me lasagna for my birthday  Told me. I love you like a daughter.  Two. Years.  Now. She is nowhere to be found. I messaged her son. Just to see if she is OK. He left me on read. I think that tells me what I need to know.   Its fine if she does not want to see me but I would have been looking for a new one. Idk why its so hard to just reply and say no sessions available.  People are telling me she can't do this but what about if she is hurt or sick or anything. Then I will feel like a complete Donkey.  She has even called me bawling and I have talked her through things.  The problem with our relationship was that I think it was definitely a lot to do with the fact that my mom abused me for years and I've never had a loving mother figure. So she stepped into that role, and it made me happy but I didn't really care if it was unethical.  I don't know where to go from here. So much trauma. So much information that she and only she herself knew. Never judged me. I have a very hard time trusting people . So im terrified to even GO to another therapist. Can't focus on work 100% because I'm always worried. Need therapist. Where is my old therapist is she dead. Is she fired.  Sigh. Reddit what do I do. I dont want to report her bit am being told to do so. I need advice. I am looking for a new therapist but I csnt believe it ended this way especially since of my past.amd abandonment  Thank you for listening .","Wow. What the hell? Is she definitely a licensed therapist? What she did is unethical on so many levels, it almost reads like this is a person who doesn't know the first thing about how therapy works.

ngfy6z,"I terribly feel like it's no use to have a job to work, or to eat, or to communicate in any way to another human being. Including my parents and friends. I feel like I wanna just cease to exist, but I don't want to kill myself. I feel like it's just too much work.  I've been feeling like this for quite a while and had actually accepted that I'm going to live my life in this numb state for the rest of my life. But, my recent interaction with a friend made me feel better for a very short span.  He had goals, he'd been working his ass off to reach them. And no, they're not exactly regarding his passion. It's just he wants to reach a particular position in the job (manager/senior manager) within the set age. And, is able to work on a job that he's not exactly is passionate about. And this made me question myself for a while, even I had an aim to get to manager role by a given age. But, when I started working, I never found any job that I had taken so far to want to make me work more, or even to work to maintain the job. I work for a while, and when I feel like things keep getting too difficult or boring, I quit and find something else, but now as years went, I partly regret for not being able to stick to a commitment even in an easy job. But, I still want to reach to a good position.  So, when interacted with this friend, it made me want to commit myself to the job that I do now and to aim for a shorter goal and move step by step. And things were going smoothly for a while. But, had a recent clash with my senior staff who is now cornering me and gave me a difficult task, and now I again feel like quitting if possible. But, I aslo so desperately don't want to quit as the company has a good name for itself and I wanna learn and make something out of myself here.  I am a 25(F) living with my parents, and it just struck me of the responsibilities I would face if I wanted to take responsibility on myself. And it is scaring the shit out of me.  But, this is not the only reason I feel like I wanna 'cease to exist' as, I've been feeling that a job or anything is only being forced up on me, to meet self created expectations and self created evaluation and analysing. But, naturally there are not needed to live. Thus, making me feel like I shouldn't work or something. To put in simpler terms, I feel like I can achieve things if I set my mind to want it. But, I don't want to want, said goals or any kind of target or goal to achieve, at the same time feel bad about myself for being a big lump of oxygen consuming being. I feel like, I'm ""living"" for the sake of existing and thus don't want any sort of normal human activity.","I think it’s in our nature to feel like we want to have a meaning. You expressed this with wanting to have a certain job or meet a certain goal in that job. But a meaning can come from anywhere. I once (and sometimes still do) feel like you feel. Like, what’s the point. It can be a long dark road to travel to try to understand the point of anything. But I had an adult mentor tell me the best way to get out of that funk was to do something for someone.  So, I might suggest you think about something you enjoy: animals, music, plants, kids, art, food... anything. And then find a way to connect with it by doing something. Volunteer somewhere, create something, offer to help a friend, neighbor, coworker, with something. It doesn’t have to be anything big or important or difficult. Just a little thing involving something you like.  You also mentioned talking to a friend which seemed to provide some motivation. Maybe you have been isolated a while, or you don’t have many opportunities for conversation. I’d encourage you to talk to someone everyday. Just a conversation about anything, they could be a friend, stranger, neighbor, but try to make a connection each day. I say this because I know I can go down a spiral of anxiety, but one conversation can take me right out of that negative headspace.  I hope you are able to feel better. *edit: fixed autocorrect",6

I might have had a perfectly fine conversation but I hang up the call and I’m like “that was so fucking stupid” “you’re a fucking idiot” AHHH I just feel so weird. I’ve had therapy a few times but now is the only time I’ve done a zoom calls instead of f2f. I actually feel like I’m over sharing to my therapist? What the fuck is that about,There is no such thing as over-sharing to a therapist. That’s what they are there for and you determine what you want to share. It is typical to feel shame when you tell things attached to shame to someone else. It is part of the process working through it and your therapist will help you identify where the shame comes from and maybe how to let go of that depending on what your goals are.,33
nh4c0l,I know she would listen and respect me but it just scares the shit out of me. I wanna tell her I have never gone to sleep without form fantasy going through my head about sexual things. Often do I find myself wrapped up in my fantasies in my head sexual or not. I am thinking about bringing this up in out next session.  I guess I just think about this stuff so often and I feel like she would probably want to know for my sake to understand me better. Most of the time my thoughts are almost stagnant in a way where I will picture something in my mind and then keep getting distracted from it so it never really progresses too far. Idk I’ll probably just talk to her about it but I just don’t understand because I think about sex a lot but when it comes the time i cant relax and I have disassociated before during sex and I do not like that or want to do that. I just feel like a but of a contradiction in this sense.,Part of her knowing you is finding out there are some things you don’t want to talk about. Snd part of the way she’ll help you is letting you know it’s entirely up to you how you’d like to conduct your relationship with her.,64
nhpyn3,"A lot of people on reddit have suggested that I go and get therapy because of my depression and just overall bad mental health. But the problem is that therapy is pretty expensive and just seems like it's meant for people who have a steady income. Well, what about the rest of the humans who can't afford therapy and probably want to kill themselves? Because they don't have money, are they just destined to be forever messed up and probably end up committing suicide because of money restrictions? Everything in this world revolves around money, nobody cares about people.","community mental health centers will offer therapy on a sliding scale fee which means that they will charge you whatever you can pay. i've heard of places people  paying $5-$10 dollars per session - think of it as not getting a coffee or a fast food once a week instead and working on your mental health. a lot of places will also do it for free, but they don't advertise this. you'll need to call around. academic institutions will often offer reduced rates/free because they are training clinicians who cannot be paid yet. definitely call some community mental health centers.",48

Where does you entitlement, obnoxiousness, selfishness, stubbornness, and intolerance for opposing views come from?  That's where you start, but figuring out what those issues are all about and beginning to properly order them. None of those are necessarily bad, but if allowed to grow out of proportion they can begin to be harmful. Figure out what is good about those things, and bolster those aspects. Figure out what is impedimentary about them, and discard those aspects.  Based purely on my own experience and observations of others, I am willing to bet that you are a pretty sheltered kid, maybe you come from money and have lived an insulated life, or maybe you have controlling parents who never let you make a mistake.

njzo8j,"I should preface things with this is an issue that doesn't effect my life in a major way, just a minor inconvenience. I am a highly functioning well adjusted person, however, I can get obsessive over things. I don't obsessive over people or anything, but I will get obsessed over things I want to buy or events happening in the future.  For instance, one of my hobbies is video games. A few months ago, I got obsessed with the idea of buying a new Nintendo switch. It was all I could talk about and all I could think about. After a few weeks the impulse passed, but it was a rough few weeks where I could only think about that and agonize over whether I should get one or not. It drove my fiancee nuts hearing me go on about it constantly.  Most recently I have become obsessed over my wedding happening in November. I didn't want to have a wedding, but I agreed to it cause it's something my fiancee dreamed about her entire life. I flipped a switch in my brain to get on board with this, but now I'm obsessed with it. I can't stop thinking about it. I want all of the planning to get done. I want to go pick out the rings and my suit. I'm literally getting to the point where it's getting annoying for the people around me, but I can't quiet my brain.  I am and all or nothing person, so when I decide I'm doing something I DO IT! But I don't want to drive future wife, my parents, my groomsmen, and my soon to be in-laws nuts over it.  One of the things, I've noticed is that I have an internal monologue (my fiancee does not). Its that voice I'm your head that kinda speaks along with your thoughts, And my internal monologue can get very loud.   My question is how do you quite the brain down, how do you get it to stop obsessing over stupid shit like wedding bands and center pieces.  One thing I try is musical meditation and audiobooks but if I'm in a setting with other people that doesn't work too well. I also read at night to shut my brain down, but that only works as long as I'm reading.   This is nowhere near the level of some of the issues posted here, but it's definitely an issue.","I just overthink and overdramatize. Working on yourself is hard, daily work.

nkt2t2,"Last session was very distressing. It all started with the first glance into the eyes of my therapist. He just stayed quiet and I was squirming in my seat, trying to think of something to say but nothing came out. When he wanted to know, what was keeping me from talking, I realized that it was the feeling of being annoying to him, of him having grown tired of me and wanting to get rid of me. I told him and he said, that maybe it seemed to me to be like that because he keeps on asking me questions and because I wouldn't answer he always starts giving me options for answers. He said, that maybe he seemed to be impatient to me. And then he told me, that he only does this, because he wanted to relieve me from the distressing silence (I really feel bad when there's silence).   Then he wondered how he could make me believe, that he is not annoyed with me and fucking apologized for making me feel this way. That just killed me. I felt so ashamed and cried and  my heart hurt so much and I didn't say a word till the end of the session. I wanted to disappear, I wanted to be nothing. But I also wanted my therapist to be there for me, to support me and care for me. But I hated myself for that whish and just kept on crying because it occurred to me, that I am such a baby and that I still have a long way to go to be ok.  But somehow I feel relieved now, although I don't really get why it hurt so much to hear my therapist say those words, but I think he might understand me a little bit more. Can someone relate to this?","Whenever I feel this way, which I certainly feel sometimes, I shrug it off by saying to myself, “I sure hope that salary they are making off this hour of work feels like enough to compensate them for that feeling.” Truth is, the feelings that other people have about me that they do not communicate to me are none of my business, and I do not succeed by tailoring my behavior to cater to feelings I project on them.",27
nla19q,"My last two roles were incredibly tough on me. I started my career many years ago now as a graduate. I was super ambitious, keen and ready to learn. What I was met with was bullying, sexism, sexual harassment, racism and professional neglect. I spent the first three years incredibly depressed, isolated and ballooned in weight trying to cope with everything. Some nights my mind goes back to certain teams I was on, a dirty look from a manager, weeks sitting alone in the office, the poor reputation spread about me which cost me opportunities and how I contemplated suicide many times as a young professional in my work toilets. I would spend 10-15 minutes when I could to escape the day because nothing I did was good enough for these people. I’ll never forget when I thought I had finally found my big break and the manager wrote on my review card I was 0 for everything. I remember working late, sitting in 6 hour meetings and desperately trying to please my team because I wanted to do well. 0 was incompetent. Thank God for a then senior friend who coached me through that time. I had hit rock bottom. But things got lower for the last time I hoped. I moved to my last role and I thought it would be my fresh start. It was not. The colleague I sat next to wouldn’t speak to me for some reason, he was so influential that it trickled down to everyone in the team and I was isolated again. Desperate to not have a repeat, I organised team events (despite being new) and no one gave a crap. My manager was OK but would scream at me in the office and I almost broke down again.  Needless to say I got therapy, out performed and then left for my current role which is so much better. So much!  It’s just that when I think about these past experiences my heart tanks and I become low in mood. Is this PTSD? Yes I am in therapy. EDIT: I have a history of abuse (sexual / physical).","Yes.

She then proceeds to trouble everyone by ranting about problems and saying she hates this thing, she hates that person.

These whole chapters in my life sometimes pop back up out of nowhere, and I remember all the people, how I felt waking up in those days and going about in the world.  They come with huge ""zeitgeists"", for lack of a better term, like the general mix of feelings you had back then about your situation and the future. I don't know if I'm describing it properly, but for example I can remember standing on my front porch when I was 21 and my parents were out of the house not around to catch me, smoking a cigarette in total privacy when it was freezing out.  The sun was going down casting a beautiful purple light on the snow.  I don't know why those vivid memories stick out but there has to be a good reason or my mind wouldn't hold onto it. Can some of you share some vivid ""snippets"" your mind holds onto and give your take on why you think you remember them so much? This is something I find extremely interesting. EDIT: If anyone's interested in why I think my example stays with me, the best I can come up with is that it was an analogy for how I thought my future was gonna be.  That is, hiding away from the controlling dominant people I served while trying to get tiny bits of happiness here and there.  Seeing that cold purple sunset was a reminder that the world was gonna be as cold as my upbringing, and the hope I had that the world outside of my family/high school was gonna be different was slowly coming back to reality.  I was gonna be in the situation of serving dominant people forever, never to be loved or find love, and the best I could hope for was a ""cigarette"" in my solitude. Tiny bits of pleasure to keep me going. It wasn't that I was scared of the world.  I knew how to navigate it as a submissive person.

I can remember the route turn for turn, I can still see the warm glow coming from her house when I parked across the street. I think that time really sticks with me because it was such a novel feeling to me, both of us being excited to spend as much time together as possible. For the first time in years I was coming out of my depressed introvert shell and it was great. \- early 2020, end of the same relationship. She and I are driving over this mountain pass as the sun sets, silently watching the world washed out in gold. Listening to my favourite album at the time, the specific song that really sticks out is Miracle by Madeon. It was a calm moment in a time when we knew the relationship was ending and things were hard, but for a little while it was all okay.",27
npvfa3,"I don't have friends. I usually chalked that up to me being insecure and introverted. Nothing uncommon. But lately I wonder if there's a completely different reason people don't want to be around me. Maybe im just not...good? And people can tell, so they avoid me? I don't know. I felt like I was doing good. I was trying my best to push myself out of my comfort zone and be more open to new people and experiences, but this changes things.  But then I ask myself, ""What if I am a bad person?"" That doesn't mean I can't _change_. I don't have to stay bad. I don't know. I feel like I'm hurting people without trying and I don't know why or how to stop it.","Truly bad people dont worry about being a bad person, OP :) I know plenty of people who just dont have a ton of friends due to tons of different things: a clique-y school, moving to a new area, introverted, busy, etc. Its hard to put yourself out there, but it sounds like youre on the right track! I moved about 10 times in my childhood so ive had to make new friends plenty of times, and the most notable thing is to just smile and talk to people, simple as it sounds. Looking approachable is a huge part of making conversation, which in turn is how you maintain those newly formed friendships! But to summarize, I’m sure you’re not a bad person OP, you just gotta learn more of those social-skills that come with friend making. Dont listen to the insecurity and keep it up, I’m proud of you for going out of your comfort zone and being open minded!!",28
nqbkif,"I'm always grateful for my T, but sometimes I just feel so incredibly fortunate that I have her, as someone who genuinely cares and has my back (Yes, I'm aware I pay her, but also, I feel like she just genuinely cares).. I've known her for three years (I go to therapy on and off), and I still find myself so grateful that I found her and she has helped me overcome complex trauma, among other things. I won't be seeing her for three months (as my fiancee is pregnant so taking a break), and she let me hug her goodbye. I also found out she is moving closer, and will be doing a home office for clients she knows well, so that cuts my commute time to her so much easier.  <3",Yes! I'm thankful every time we meet and often during the in between time. You and I are blessed!,5
nqp1gz,"We don’t usually pay for our therapy in the UK and have to wait months for NHS appointments. I recently came into a position where I can pay for therapy. My therapist’s (the one in question) sessions cost £130 an hour, around USD$185.  I am getting some benefit from these appointments for intrusive thoughts and OCD compulsions. His specialty is OCD.  So, my therapist has always been late to our zoom sessions: 10min, 15min, 30min and today, 50min (will keep you updated).  I sent an email (paraphrased;) saying I was upset and frustrated that he had been late to every session and that I was rethinking our arrangement.  What do I do? I’m really considering stopping our sessions. Do I pay for the two sessions we’ve had? I just needed a place to vent this (you guys can imagine!) as it’s pretty upsetting. Thanks","update 1: he never showed  Update 2: Text from therapist 3mins after I sent email: > Hi CheesyChips, I was caught up in a clinical emergency I can call at 16.00 or 17.00 tomorrow would that work for you all the best, Therapist Update 3: Email: > I have just seen your email and everything you say is correct and I apologise. Today was due to circumstances I had to address but the point you make about previous lateness is important.  Given the circumstances I would like to offer you the next session, if you wish to continue,  free of charge to make this up to you.  Please let me know what you would like to do.",62
nrcabs,"So I need a solution for this: Some people who are perfectionist tie their sense of self worth to qualify of their performance ( how prefect did I do this task?) But then they procrastinate as a form of defense mechanism. Basically they think if I procrastinate and don’t do the tasks , then there is no score for quality of my performance, since I didn’t even start performing and therefore my self esteem is protected . Basically they are protecting their self esteem by procrastinating. The quality of the work can not be judged because the work is not done yet ( never started working on it)  What would be the solution ( with steps) Do solve the issue?","Well, start by realizing perfectionism = procrastination with better PR. In other words, it's an excuse that sounds good, but it's also a lie.  It's not that you fear FAILING. You fear STARTING. What you're really dealing with here is being risk averse. You're afraid to act without knowing exactly where the next footfall will go. Truth is, you probably can't even envision the end result, because you're too worried about the first step. The solution is to focus less on the PRODUCT and more on the PROCESS. Map out each step that needs to be done. Then map out all the information you need to have to get going on that step. Map out exactly what tasks are going to be involved. And I mean map it out: have a physical (or digital) chart outlining the plan from start to finish. Set it up so you can check stuff off as you go. Obviously, this can become an obsession of it's own, so set a time budget for it. Set a time budget for everything, with mini-deadlines at each step. You're basically breaking the thing down from a meal to individual bites, then focusing on one bite at a time. The meal will take care of itself. Also, get comfortable with mind vomit. If it's time to start a step, and you don't feel you're ready, just spew out whatever you've got. Doesn't have to make sense, be rational, have good grammar, whatever. Just produce SOMETHING. You'll probably immediately trash it, but at least you go going. Then spew again. Keep spewing until you realizing you're either going to keep doing this or actually do something meaningful.  It's like old-fashioned cars. They needed cranks to get started. Stop worrying about the END and focus on the start. You'll get going.",30
nsz234,"I wasn't too close to him, we were diametrically opposed in so many ways, and so alike in so many other ways. We spoke on occasion, vs my mom who I haven't seen or spoken to in 16-17 years.  I don't feel bad or anything. Legit, when I found out, I ordered Arby's delivery, got baked and watched a movie.  My GF is on a trip with her BFF, so I'm here. Just wondering what it's supposed to be like when your dad dies. I'm not a normal person, so I've been told. And often... How do normal people react to this, I'm flying blind here? At least how can I mimic normal behavior in this case?","Your reaction is just that…your reaction.  My grandfather died when I was 16. He was a terrible man. Abusive to people and animals, racist, homophobic, the whole nine yards. When they told me he’d died I shrugged and went on with my life. Not one tear shed.  My cat had to be put down two days after my grandfather died. The grief I felt for my sweet friend was incalculable. I cried for him for weeks.  It can be a different response every time and that’s ok. There is no “right” way to grieve. I’m so sorry for your loss. ",37
ntr0kl,"I really hate it. They generally ask when an event involving them has happened. It’s so obnoxious. Even if they weren’t involved, I hate being asked that. I can’t explain how invasive it feels.  Therapy isn’t just confidential for the therapist. I get to keep things confidential too.  I need to find a good response line…. Edit: I obviously know that I can tell them I don’t want to talk about it. This is a venting post. ","I'm gobsmacked that you even tell people tbh but that's from my perspective as I'm super closed off! Suffice to say that the very small number of people who do know, would never ever be so rude or intrusive as to ask.  I'd suggest a response like 'I mainly talk about how to answer rude questions like this one' then quickly change the subject.  I might also consider revising who knows you're in therapist - you need positive support, not toxic self-interested people like these.",28
nu71fd,"Hey, I’m 15 I’ve been extremely poor my whole life to the point of homelessness. My dad is a drug addict/dealer and is constantly in and out of jail and my mom is a 35 year old women with the mind of a fuvking 16 year old and hasn’t had a real job in like 3 years and relies on other men to keep her life afloat which seems to work out horrible in the end. I live in my moms bfs moms old rundown trailer that looks like a fucking abandoned house at first glance and is held together by some scrap wood and glue. It’s depressing that I can’t live life like a normal teen and have friends over and I constantly question god (if he exist) why me. I’m embarrassed of how I live and the conditions I was raised in it’s like no matter how far I get In life I get knocked back and pushed down and I’m losing hope/motivation.","Your not alone,  I'm 27m and I grew up in extreme poverty as well. For different reasons, my mom was extremely sick, which led to a pain medication drug addiction and almost every dollar my dad made as a maintenance worker going towards keeping her alive. She died anyway when I was 17 and my dad collapsed into a depression,  leaving my younger brother and I to take care of ourselves.  The embarrassment and shame of poverty is real, and I deeply relate to living in a house that looked like an abandoned junk heap. We didn't even have electricity half the time or water. I almost had a gf back in HS, a girl I was in love with, but I was so embarrassed she'd want me to bring her over, I never asked her out. Even though I knew she was interested. Well the good news... With a lot of hard work and struggle,  eventually it gets better. I moved out when I was 18 and more or less never looked back. I worked 2 jobs to put myself through undergrad while living in a tiny crappy room, but got a decent paying job after and moved into a nicer place.  Then after 2 years decided to go back to law school and just graduated 2 weeks ago. I'm still currently poor lol, with lots of school debt. But I'm not in poverty anymore and more importantly, I have a good job lined up for September and will move into a decent apartment then also! I traveled internationally for the first time just a few weeks ago, which was a pipe dream growing up, and things are looking good for the future. My younger brother took a slightly different path, and I was very worried about him for a while as he got in a little trouble, then bounced around  a bit after HS. But he turned things around, and just landed himself a fancy computer job making over $100k, more than me, without having to pile on any school debt.  My new job I'll make almost that much, but more in time. Even though I'll be paying off law school to I'm dead probably lol... It took a while, but we are both doing okay, and you can too. Just keep moving forward, and DON'T let mistakes and obstacles hold you down! There will be plenty.  Oh and don't knock any girls up. Having kids too early, when you are poor is kind of a major burden. Feel free to message me also.",159
numfg5,"I'm just discovering HOW MUCH I'm used to ignore my body on a daily basis. Even in the dumbest things like delaying the urge to pee. I have been doing it for so many years that I didn't realise it. I just didn't get how everybody else needed to use the toilet between 2 hour long lessons while I could just go without peeing for half a day and be fine (it partly had to do with me being dehydrated cause I also postponed drinking water) And the same with going to sleep, like what if we ACTUALLY went to bed the first moment we felt sleepy? Why put it off just for the sake of productivity or whatever it is that we are doing? Also I'm starting to adress and release my emotions by recognising where do I feel them in my body. If I want to keep that emotion I try to do something that will intensify/prolongue that feeling and if I want to be able to move on from it I think of something that will relax that part for my body. Like for example, an hour ago I was angry and felt it right behind my mouth and I felt like laughing would be nice, so I did with some YouTube videos and now I'm more calm and can concentrate on studying. But 3 days ago I was angry as well and I felt it at the crown of my head and in a more agressive way so I went for a run and shouted a bit into the emptyness and that worked too (Obviously this doesn't mean I'm ignoring what made me angry, if I could fix it I would go right away and confront that person/change the situation, but I'm finding myself in situations I can't control and forced to interact with people who don't understand me so this my only way to manage it by the moment) Does anybody else feel this way or do this as well? This is being such an exciting part of reparenting myself and I want everybody to experience the same. Let me know what you do to take care of your body!! Edit: typos and clarification",YES I’ve been a lot better about listening to my body! The biggest ones are when I’m tired and when I’m hungry. I’ve felt so much better ever since this lifestyle change :),23
nv1nxv,"I (18) started therapy 3 years ago because of my ED and to process the death of my father. At first my therapist really helped me regarding my mourning but then she started to show a somewhat toxic behavior.  I came out to her as a lesbian (she always insisted I need to talk about everything to her, especially my friends and family drama) and she was acting quite homophobic (“you’ll change your mind”, calling my serious girlfriend “my best friend” and insisting I’m “just confused”).  She often didn’t listen to me or answer to calls or texts during the appointment.  Even tho my younger brother is often violent with me and my mother (she’s an enabler) and made me fear for my life she told me to avoid calling CPS because “it’ll ruin the family”. She refuse to give me a diagnosis about my issues and sent me to an orthopedic online specialist in order to get me antidepressants after a 30 min online session, which only caused me to sleep all the time and vomit, while I didn’t have a clue about my situation. I confronted her and she berated me for my Illness saying it’s my fault for wasting her time an efforts. Never exited a meeting so fast, please pay attention when going to a therapist.","gosh, what a shitty person. if you’re not willing to help people why would you choose that one job that is so critical for the lives of people who desperately need your help.",98
nw14kw,"My inner child feels horribly wounded.  I opened up to my T about how I wish I could have a hug from her. She was very polite and professional about it all but mentioned how her ethics protocols prevents her from doing this and that it would make my attachment issues worse. She did say we could have a hug  during my farewell ritual at my last session.  While my adult self understands this completely, my inner child feels devastated.  She feels rejected all over again and that my T doesn't care about her as she thought. I can't stop crying... I have never cried as much as I did in this session. I feel like I lost my T as someone I trusted... I don't want to trust her ever again.... my inner child feels angry at her...at the same time I feel like a horrible person for being so upset about this. ","Sounds like you have a solid T. Keep her!  As for your inner child, wrap your arms around her, embrace her pain, and treasure this time of growth and healing. You got this.",85
