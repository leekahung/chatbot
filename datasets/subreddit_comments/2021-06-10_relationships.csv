The hardest part for me was saying goodbye in the morning. It's my routine that I wake him up, he gives me a kiss, tells me he loves me and tells me to be safe. It was all ""normal"" to him and he did just that. Tears were threatening to spill over the entire time he was saying goodbye to me, and believe if it had not been dark, he would have known something was up. (I wanted to yell and scream, at him, but I didn't)  I left, treated myself to breakfast in an empty park and waited. The nanny cams that I bought have a live feed option thru your smartphone. I ate my breakfast while watching him clean up the house, watched my dogs torture each other (I left the dishes from dinner last night in the sink on purpose, petty I know but I needed to get some kicks in).   Then she came over, there wasn't much fanfare, he placed the dogs in the backyard, she came into the living room and then things started happening. I let it happen, I let both of them get comfortable, move into the guest room waiting for things to heat up a little more. I had switched all the exhaust fans on throughout the house before I left( they cover up some noise and the door can be noisy). I parked right in front of my house and managed to open the door without being too loud.  I had decided that just walking in like I normally do and putting my stuff down in my normal chair was the way to go. I closed the door put my stuff down (all while watching them on the camera) and called out as I'm walking down the hall ""Hey babe?! Guess what, I got cancelled! Where are you?""  Screaming ensued from her(I redditor called it!). Lots of ""Oh my god, you said she wasn't going to be here, what the fuck is wrong with you."" while scrambling to find something to cover herself. I managed to act surprised and said something along the line of "" Does someone want to explain what the fuck is going on?""  I managed to not get on my soapbox and preach at the fat slag, I found her fat ass running out of my house covered with a towel and yoga pants around her knees to be much more humorous.  He was dumbfounded, he could not say anything for at least 10 minutes. I maintained silence as well, I just stood there and stared at him with the ""uh hello.... you need to explain the naked chick that just ran out of my house"" look.  I couldn't stand the silence anymore, I had to break it. I said ""I did nothing to deserve this kind of treatment, this is not the way you treat someone you love."" I then walked into my bathroom and proceeded to let myself cry silently for about 10 minutes. During that time he came to his senses and was trying to weed himself out trouble using every excuse in the book. Telling me he thinks he is a sex addict and wants help....blah blah blah.  After my tears were dry I opened the bathroom door and just said, ""Please get your things that you can now, get a friend to help you with your large things tomorrow while I am here, I am changing the locks tonight and you are no longer welcome here""   I proceeded to make myself a bump on a chair watching netflix and cuddling my dogs and totally ignoring the hurt puppy dog eyes and crying fits he was having.  He took all his clothes and he left, he had a friend pick him up. I had a(married) guy friend(Friends with the wife as well) pick up another lock set and install it for me as I am totally fried. It took me more than a few hours to sort everything out to where I can write it down.  As for me, I'm hurt, upset, pissed, but I can smile, I have my dignity and I got just what I wanted.   ---    **tl;dr**: Update: Caught him in the act, only a little bit of drama ensued, no police were called, no one fought. He cried, groveled, I stood my ground.   As the original was deleated this is the jist: email auto signed in on his computer(mine crashed, used with permission) title of most recent email was something to the effect of ""Can't wait for next week"" He had replied. I read it. Chaos ensued","I know it hurts but you're a badass and should be very proud of how you handled that. I think I would've grabbed the bitch's hair and slung her out and gotten charged with assault, so good on you for keeping your calm and handling it like a champ.",1864
264d22,"I'm sorry if this sounds disjointed, I'm in a bit of a state right now. I was using my girlfriend of 5 years' computer, and I opened an unnamed folder on her desktop. Inside I found pictures of her clearly having sex with someone I have never seen before. I can barely type right now, let alone speak. She is at work right now, she won't be home for another 6 hours. I don't know what to do, reddit. I can't think, I can barely move, I feel so... lost. I don't know how I am going to recover from this. I can't afford to move out, but I would rather be homeless than spend one more second here. Any advice on how to proceed or even just some kind words would be appreciated. ---    **TL/DR: Found pictures of LTR girlfriend cheating. Please help.** Slight update: Once I felt like I could breathe again, I looked at the EXIF data from the pictures. They're from last month, taken by her phone.  Update 2: Thank you, everyone. I still feel like I want to throw myself in front of a bus (less so than before), but I found somewhere to stay until I get back on my feet. If anyone has any suggestions about how to stop feeling like there is a weight slowly crushing my chest, I would really appreciate it. I have some packing to do, but I will try to respond to the thread when I can. **Update 3**: I'm not vomiting or crying anymore, so I will consider that an improvement. Now I just feel empty. Like, somewhere between my belly button and my ribs is a space that used to be occupied and now is vacant. Time heals all wounds, I suppose.  First, thank you all for responding to this thread. You have no idea how much it means to me to know that others, even if they are halfway around the world, care about this. Your collective advice and words of encouragement have helped me immensely.  Second, to update the situation, my things are packed and in my car. I found someone to stay with temporarily, although I'm not sure for how long. I took the things that were sentimental to me or reminded me of her, drove them out of town, and burned and smashed it all. It was cathartic. I suppose littering the outdoors with my mementos isn't very eco-friendly, but I'm hoping Mother Nature will give me a pass on this one.   Third, as per a number of requests in the thread, I changed her desktop background to one of the pictures. Having to look at it again while I did so was even harder than packing, I think, but it is done. It was unnecessary, as I have already asked her via text to never contact me again, but it is satisfying to know that she will have to come home to that.  To answer some of the other questions posed in the thread:  * EXIF data from the pictures said they were taken by her phone last month. * I have racked my brain, and surprisingly, I cannot come up with any red flags about the relationship. She is a redditor, so I am trying to avoid specifics, but they were taken while she was on an extended trip. Perhaps she thought that she could have some sort of fling with someone she met and I would be none the wiser. * I can't explain why she left a folder containing these pictures on her laptop. It seems incredibly stupid to me, but it isn't like they were in plain sight. They were among a number of other, seemingly benign pictures. * I do not believe she wanted me to find out; she seems very upset and has been begging me to talk with her about it. Finally, I just want to reiterate: Thank you, Reddit. The support, the stories, and the kind words have meant more than any of you could know. ","Thought my story of when I was cheated on and caught them in the act might help... or at least help crack a smile. I know how crushing this feels but trust me, you'll get over it and realize how much better off you are... Anyway.. story time... I had actually come home a week earlier than I was supposed to from the air force (this was a good 15 years ago) and figured I'd surprise her since she'd always talk about how much she misses me, would always send me pictures of her in the mail and write these long letters talking about our future together. Naturally I assumed she would be more than excited to see me walk in the door a week early.  Pulled up to the house and figured she was home because her car was there so I was as quiet as possible. Even parked my car down the street a little so she didn't see me pull up and ruin the surprise. Quietly put the key in the lock and slowly twisted...opened the door and the living room was dark. I thought... hm. Maybe she got picked up by some friends and went out somewhere. Oh well even better! I'll set up our room by going to get some flowers and making everything look all romantic and irresistible.... (hey it's been a few months, I was a bit pent up at that point). Start walking towards the bedroom and I hear this rhythmic squeaking noise followed by a deep grunt. My instinct reaction was someone broke in and trying to rip something off the wall, so I went into ass kicking mode until a few seconds later I heard a high pitched moan of a female. Yeah... I recognized that sound pretty well and knew what was happening. Being in the military I knew the worst possible thing I could do was anything violent so I wanted to fuck up whatever ""moment"" they were having. I walked towards the room very quietly while they went at it... of course they didn't hear me because they were far too ""deep"" in their actions. Luckily the door was halfway open so I got down and started crawling towards the bed out of their line of sight, slithered over to the edge of the bed they were closest to and started slowly inching my head up the side until just my eyes were above the edge. It took her a good minute (she was on the bottom) before she looked over and saw angry eyes staring at her. She freaked out so bad that she kicked the dude in the face and he fell off the bed and hit his head on the wall, she screamed louder than I've heard anyone scream in my life and bounced off the bed in a flailing, sweaty mess and I heard her ass hit the ground with a satisfying thud. I stood up and the guy was in a heap on the floor scared shitless at this dude in full military garb standing over him with crazy eyes. She finally realized who it was and started bawling her eyes out saying ""i'm so sorry! I was lonely!"" blah blah blah... who cares. I started laughing hysterically and all I said was ""Well dude, she's your problem now. Hope you don't mind herpes"" ",556
2le8dq,"[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2kwtvj/my_27m_girlfriend_23f_3_months_still_wears_the/) Well, I brought it up to her again that it made me uncomfortable.  She used her usual excuses ""i'm used to it"" ""it doesn't matter who it's from "" and all the other crap.  I took most advice and brought up the idea of a new ring.  Nope, not an option.  I maybe got a little more angry than I needed to after that, or stressed, I don't know.  Anyways, she began crying, a lot.  And then the apologizing.  And then the ""I'm sorry, I'm still in love with him"". and then awesome fucking truth where she told me she has been sleeping with him the entirety of our relationship (she never stopped sleeping with him after they broke up). People really suck sometimes.  EDIT; I've seen this asked a few times - yes they are ACTUALLY broken up.  They used to live together and they no longer do.  They are never together in public.  He also has a new girlfriend.   ---    **tl;dr**: (ex)girlfriend wouldn't take off her exboyfriends ring even though it made me uncomfortable, turns out it was because she was still in love with him/sleeping with him. awesome. ","get an STD test!!!!!!!  someone else posted about telling your friends of her misdeeds.... You could just talk to them about what you're going through (an STD test) and the reason why you're taking one (your GF potentially introduced shit to your junk through her ex and who knows what he also tapped)  It keeps your friends in the loop regarding your life (isn't that what friends are, people who care about you and your life?) and would be a testament to the shit she has made you endure. It would also be effective at convincing them that she wronged you and all...  good luck OP",1793
2o0l1n,"A lot of you requested an update to my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nsy91/i_22m_suspect_something_between_my_girlfriend_22f/). The majority of you suggested that I speak to Brooke and/or attempt to walk in on the act.  I decided on doing both. Sunday night everyone was back in the apartment.  I had every intention of speaking to Brooke about the neighbor's comment alone, but before I could she said something that completely threw my theory off. She told Derek to get to bed so he wouldn't be tired for work in the morning. What. I knew Derek has a job on campus, but he had always worked the same night shifts. Being as casual as possible, I inquired how long he'd been working mornings and when he started. He said he picked up the extra shifts a month ago and worked at 9. (I leave at 7:45 so it's possible for me not to have noticed that). I spent the rest of the night trying to figure out whether he was lying about that, whether still he had some mornings here at home, whether Alexis could be seeing someone other than Derek in the mornings (like some of you suggested) or (again) if I was just a paranoid loser. I went to bed feeling emotionally drained and confused. The next morning I left for classes as usual and operated on autopilot. I alternated between thinking I'd run home to check on Alexis and thinking I had way too much work to run around based on a theory that I wasn't even sure about anymore.  In the end, I walked out of my first class and straight to my car to go home. In a weird way, I sort of wish I hadn't.  When I got to the apartment Derek's car wasn't there, just Alexis'. I walked to the apartment with my heart pounding all sorts of crazy. I don't know what I was expecting. Outside the apartment door I could immediately here a guy's voice inside. I heard him talking and laughing and a soft feminine mumble replying and giggling back.  I've been on this subreddit long enough to see all the different reactions people have to this situation. I never once contemplated what I'd do. I pressed my ear to the door and see if I could make out what they were saying, but I could only make out a word here and there. There was a lot of giggling. Then, I heard the sound of Alexis being tickled and shrieking.  Maybe I should've waited more. In retrospect I wish I did, but I couldn't take it. As soon as I started fiddling with my keys, it was dead silence in there. She was fucking Mark.  I never mentioned Mark in the previous post but he's one the guys in the apartment next to us (**not** the one that tipped me off). He's the only one I never liked. Fucking know-it-all douchebag attitude. Always made inappropriate comments towards both girls. Never thought anything of it. As soon as I opened the door, they both gave me a deer-in-headlights look that removed any naiive doubt I may have retained that the situation was innocent. I was planning on yelling at them or demanded answers, but (and this is fucking embarrassing) my eyes began to well with tears. I didn't want them to see that shit. So I said ""Nice. Real fucking nice."" and bolted back to my car. I heard Alexis yelling my name in the hallway and picked up the pace. I sort of expected her to be chasing me but by the time I got to the car there was no one following me. I drove to a park that's near the apartment and sat there in disbelief. My first thought, weirdly enough was *How is my family going to take this? What the hell am I going to tell them?* My family fucking loved Alexis. They joked about our wedding and regularly called her part of the family. Then I started thinking about living arrangements. Our finals end in about two weeks, there's no way I can handle moving now. I'm applying to an extremely competitive graduate program and I can't let anything get in the way of that. Definitely not this cheating bitch.  I'm writing this from a friend's house. I explained the situation, he explained it to his parents and they welcomed me to stay in their home. I'm going to have to go back home to get some clothes sometime. I'm planning on going during this lab period I know Alexis can't skip tomorrow. It took her an hour or so to start blowing up my phone, but once she did it didn't stop.  She started off asking me to come home so she could explain.  Before I even had the chance to respond she sent another one begging me to come back because she was having an anxiety attack, something I always help her through. Maybe I'm heartless, but all I could think was *good, you earned it*. There was a pause and then she sent ""I don't know why you get so jealous, we were just hanging out."" I waited. She sent ""Look, I know it looks super sketchy, believe me if I were you I'd think the same thing, but we didn't do anything. He needed advice on his girl problems. You have to believe me."" No, no I don't. Normally I would have gotten a weird sense of satisfaction watching a cheater scramble to cover their ass, but my stupid brain just kept replaying all these great times we had together and wondering if she was cheating then too. I want to know when this started, but at the same time I'm worried it's been going on for longer than the month I've suspected something. I received a text later that night from a number I didn't recognize. It was the nice dude from next door. He said (paraphrasing because it was a long text) that he got my number from Derek. He was extremely sorry for what I was going through and that he would have told me sooner but he wasn't completely sure.  He said he knew his friend was seeing a girl with a boyfriend, but didn't put it together until he learned the girl's name. As many of you suspected, the comment was him trying to tip me off. So yeah, I guess he's bro of the year.  I don't think Derek and Brooke know yet. I haven't texted them. I haven't found the words. I know it's going to turn our living arrangement and friendships upside down. I guess I should message them before Alexis paints a different picture.  I wonder what the cool neighbor said when he asked for my number. I don't think he told them, the would have said something... Right? Unless they took her side. Then I've lost my girlfriend *and* friends. Any advice on coping with something like this, especially from those who have been there before, please let me know. I don't have many friends to reach out to besides the guy I'm staying with. Alexis, Brooke and Derek were basically my family. Alexis and I had talked about spending our lives together. I have never been serious about a girl the way I was with her.  **EDIT:** I am seriously moved by the amount of support you guys are giving me here. Please keep them coming, I may not reply to all the comments but I've read each one on both posts. I'm going to tell Derek and Brooke soon. I'll try to do a follow up when I have some sort of plan.  ---    **TL;DR** She was cheating, but it wasn't with Derek. I'm shattered. ","She didn't chase you and took an hour before texting you?  Either she wanted to get in one last good fuck with Mark, or she knew she was fucked over and was trying to come up with a story. Or both.  Go no contact. Focus on your studies and tests. You've got big things ahead in your life and don't need this two-timing ho to drag you down with her lies and gas lighting. A few months from now this will be a distant memory. Good luck!  Please post another update after shit settles to let us know how much better things are without her. ",3504
2oi4im,"[Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nsy91/i_22m_suspect_something_between_my_girlfriend_22f/) [Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2o0l1n/update_i_22m_suspect_something_between_my/) You wonderful motherfuckers. Between the comments to both posts and my inbox I have an immense collection of personalized pep talks, which I am referring to whenever I feel down (admittedly, a lot these days). I got advice/stories from all sorts of people - married, single, old, young... Wow. I never thought the internet would bring me this level of support. I just want you guys to know that by just typing up some comments you have made a very real difference in someone's life. Gotta say it feels a little strange receiving 6 reddit gold and making it to /r/bestof just for sharing the worst day of my life, haha.  I got a lot of messages urging me to join redpill. This experience has soured my view of **Alexis.** Not women in general. I got some messages saying I write too well and this is obviously made up. I have two words for you: I wish.  A clarification on the last update: I wasn't clear about what I see when I walked in. They weren't literally fucking, they were just sitting on the couch with a deer-in-headlights look that was incredibly incriminating and they both went quiet. It was just obviously not a ""hey, guess who dropped by"" situation. Anyways, onto the update. I've been extremely busy with the semester ending and I took the majority's advice to bury my head in work. I've spent a lot of time at the library because Alexis never goes there. In the process of posting the last update I realized how dumb it was that I hadn't contacted Derek and Brooke with my side. I screen-shotted the text from the cool neighbor, Will. (Side note: all names have been changed except Mark because fuck you Mark). Within the minute Derek was blowing up my phone with calls and texts that made it very apparent he didn't know anything. At the same time Alexis was sending texts begging me to meet up with her. I was feeling miserable and sent back a single text to Derek saying I wasn't feeling up to talking, then put my phone away for the night. In the morning I got a text saying to meet him at my favorite restaurant for dinner and drinks on him, assuring me that no one would be there ""not even Brooke."" I haven't had any appetite since everything went down, but the offer meant a lot and I really did want to see him so I decided to go after classes.  I got to the restaurant first and I had my heart in my throat worrying that Alexis would somehow be there, but she wasn't. Derek came up to me and gave me a big hug and opened with ""Dude, what the fuck."" So here's where shit gets a bit crazy and dramatic. A lot of you suggested that Brooke might side with Alexis or had been covering up for her the whole time. I wasn't so sure, because while she is closer to Alexis, her and I have been friends for a bit longer. According to Derek, as soon as he told Brooke she was absolutely furious.  In his words: ""I sort of wanted to bitch Alexis out but Brooke took care of that... and then some."" Remember how I said Alexis came from a conservative small town? Her parents had NO idea that we were living together and she constantly stressed that they couldn't know or they'd cut her off financially. They liked me enough to be polite, but they were constantly worried a relationship would distract her from school and didn't want her getting pregnant or whatever.  Derek said that Brooke demanded Alexis pack her things and find a new place or she'd call up her parents and tell them everything.  Derek told me that later that night Alexis was sitting in the living room hugging a sweater I'd left behind and wailing at the top of her lungs that her life was over when Brooke yelled from her bedroom ""Well maybe you shouldn't have fucked Mark then."" Imagining that moment was kind of funny.  Brooke's always been a very no-nonsense girl with a hot temper, but I definitely didn't expect this. It was extremely touching that she took the cheating that seriously.  During that dinner all my fears that I'd lost my friends were completely washed away and I was able to choke down a few pieces of sushi.   When we left dinner, Derek promised to let me know when Alexis was gone so I could move back in.  I declined his offer, because 1) Even if she does move out everything in that apartment reminds me of her including Derek and Brooke 2) Alexis and Mark probably fucked in my room, so I really don't want to sleep in it 3) In the current emotional state I'm in I don't want to be third-wheeling a happy couple, even though I'm sure they'd be considerate.  He understood my points but said to let him know if I changed my mind, because Brooke and Alexis' friendship seems to be pretty over.  This week has been pretty uneventful, but I keep having to dodge Alexis. Luckily, I'm in an undergraduate program that only has 60 students so we have a lot of our classes together. I asked two friends to keep an eye out for her after giving them a sparknotes of the story, and started showing up to class at the last minute.  As far as I know, she only waited outside of one of my classes. I got a text saying ""Bitch has been spotted in front of (classroom). Waterworks in progress. Proceed with caution.""  I ended up skipping the class, because I didn't know if she was going to leave and I really didn't want to risk it.  Later that night she sent me a really long Facebook message explaining everything from the beginning and it sort of made me sick to read, I contemplating not reading it but once I opened it I just had to.  She said that he'd been flirty with her in the halls (as I mentioned before, he would say inappropriate shit to both girls) and she tried to be friendly back, but it must have come off as flirting because he kissed her mid-sentence one day.  She said she felt guilty that she ""led him on"" and that guilt prevented her from shooting him down in future advances because she felt like it was her fault it happened and she has trouble saying no (???)  She said they'd only slept together 3 times and she hated it, he had pushed her into it (""not rape, but..idk I never said yes either"") and she was going to end it during the conversation I walked in on.  She said she understood if I needed some time and some space but that she'd do absolutely anything to ""make it right"" and would spend the rest of her life making it up to me by: * Treating me like a king, I'd never have to cook, clean or do my laundry again * Give me full access to her phone and passwords.  She even suggested we install Life360 (an app that allows you to track someone's location through their phone) so I would know where she is at all times. * Cut off all contact with Mark and all her male friends (just for good measure, I guess?)  * Makeup sex whenever I wanted Yeah, that sounds like a healthy relationship - right? I didn't answer.  I kind of wanted to keep her on Facebook and watch the shit show unfold (she was posting dramatic statuses and song lyrics about mistakes, forgiveness and some from ""our song"") but I know how I am, I don't want to compulsively check her page or go through old photos. So I blocked her. Derek sent me a text a few hours later saying ""She's crying and screaming about you blocking her LOL""  In happier news, the family I'm staying with is fantastic. I felt a little guilty about taking up their space, electricity, etc. so I offered to put down rent and pay for some bills (I am unemployed but my family gives me a decent allowance for rent and food) but they declined. The dad said ""First month's free. If you need more time here then we'll talk about it."" and winked. My friend was telling me that they have hosted his and his sister's troubled friends so it wasn't a big deal. Still, I'm unbelievably grateful.  As for Will, (awesome neighbor) I called him to thank him for everything. I wasn't up to inviting him for dinner just yet, but I will. He apologized profusely. He says he can't stand Mark, not just for what he did with Alexis but various other things that I won't go into. He told me that Mark has been unusually quiet the past few days and told another one of the guys that he had gotten dumped. Whatever. I don't want to think about it.  So that's really all I have for you guys. I'm still going to be friends with Derek and Brooke but I'm going to limit my contact with them because they remind me of Alexis so much. I sent Brooke a message thanking her for kicking Alexis out and she said she'd do it regardless of whether or not I move back in. She's going to give me a heads up on when Alexis is gone so I can get the rest of my things. In the mean time I'm spending a lot of time studying, applying to grad schools, and hanging out with the guy I'm living with.  Earlier this week I posted onto my university's Facebook group searching for roommates for next semester and I already have a few replies. I'm going to wait until after finals to tell my parents about the situation because my mom asks a million questions about everything and I'm not in the mood to answer them.  Again, thank you thank you thank you for all the messages. I didn't not expect this level of attention and while it has made me a bit paranoid someone will recognize the story from the details - fuck it I needed the support.  I fucking love you guys.  ---    **TL;DR**: Brooke is kicking Alexis out and Derek is still my buddy. I'm doing okay given the circumstances, and I'll hopefully be finding a new apartment next month. ","Good for you dude! However, don't cut your friends out because they remind you of that bitch. You're going to remember her anyway. If anything you should see Derek and Brooke more. They have your back dude, and everybody needs more people like that in their life. Hey, and way to not be a pussy and take her back. You're the man, and I hope mark meets a mean dude in a dark alley next time he fucks somebody's gf. ",3924
2p3ih6,"I was signed into this account on my laptop and noticed I received PMs asking for an update to my [post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2or7bz/single_father_38m_with_daughter_17f_discovered/). So, here it is.  I had a long talk with my daughter Sarah that night. I sat her down and described the circumstances of the discovery. I explained that I was worried because it's a large sum of money and I didn't want her savings to be stolen.  Well, turns out the elderly neighbor, Anne, has been giving her cash for the better part of a year now. Anne wanted her to have the money to help with college expenses, and told Sarah to keep it a secret from me because I've always refused to accept money from her. Sarah also told me that part of the money was her own. She had been saving up for my birthday present and didn't want to put it in the savings account because, well, she'd have to ask me and it wouldn't be a surprise anymore.  Later in the conversation, I brought up the expensive clothing. Those were throwaways from her friend's mother. Her friend is really tall so she couldn't wear them and gave them to Sarah instead. They needed some slight alterations so she hasn't worn them yet. I apologized for snooping and explained that as a father, I was obviously concerned for her well-being. I also assured her that we are financially stable and that I've put aside enough money for her college expenses. I told her to keep an eye out for Anne, to make sure that her welfare is not affected by the money she's paying Sarah. Also, I asked her to write a thank-you card to her friend's mom and to include a present for her at Christmas this year.   After the revelations, I wanted to reward her for her savings habit, so I offered to start a checking account for her and we looked into the options online. Turns out, the bank I use offers a junior checking which I can co-sign (overdraft fees, etc) for her. It turns into her own personal account at 18. She'll have the use of a debit card, the bank also offers an online-based financial planning guide, so she will read that before starting the account. We're going to the local branch to set that up for her this weekend. Sarah seemed to reflect well to our talk. She took the opportunity to reveal that she has been in a relationship for a couple of months. I've actually met her girlfriend a few times before, they go to the same school and I just thought they were good friends so that was a surprise. So yes, she came out of the closet to me.  Being a dad, I still verified the clothing story with her friend's mom. Overall, I'm happy it was just me dramatically overreacting. However, I do feel rather guilty for the minor panic attack I had. As a parent, it's astonishing sometimes how quickly your child grows up. Just another part of the learning process I guess.  P/S: I didn't reduce her allowance but did encourage her to keep saving because it's an excellent habit.  ---    **tl;dr**: Money from neighbor, clothes from friend's mom, so she's getting her own checking account. She also disclosed she's in a relationship. Worst of all, my tortured soul is left wondering what she's buying for my birthday. ",You're an awesome dad and Sarah is an awesome person. Happy everything turned out to be ok!,2229
2rnfbl,"Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rbnd1/im_27_m_out_of_town_right_now_my_best_friend_saw/?limit=500 .  Sorry for the formatting. I'm on mobile. Well here goes....  I'm going to pick up where I left off with the last post and detail what happened from there.  My girlfriend called me at 1am and apologized profusely saying she didn't realize what time it had gotten to because she was busy. (She normally calls me around 11:30 or so). I decided then and there that I was gonna save the texts from Dave, a screen shot of the email, and confront her when I got home. I weighed my options and decided it was better to be cheated on and let it go on a few extra days and spend time with my family, then to rush home or accuse her over the phone and find out she was planning something for my birthday....I think that would ruin her trust in me forever.  Nothing seemed odd when she called. She asked after my family, sent me a few progress pictures of the quilt she was making for my mom, told me she loved me and that she would call me in the morning.  Monday morning my grandma took a turn for the worse and my brother, mother, and father all gathered at the hospice to spend the final hours with her. Somewhere in the very wee hours of Tuesday morning she passed away from lung cancer.....seriously people, put down your cigarettes.   We were really her only remaining family. My father was an only child, and she had no living siblings, and she had moved in with my parents awhile ago and hasn't kept in touch with anyone. In leu of planning a traditional funeral, we just decided to proceed with having her buried next to her husband's plot (something she had already pre-planned, paid for, and requested in her will) and spent Tuesday gathered around in the living room telling stories about her and looking through her shoeboxes full of photographs to create an updated photo album. It was nice, actually. My girlfriend kept in constant contact with me through this whole thing and talked to my parents as well. They love her.   During that time I decided to let everything fall out of my mind other than my family.  It was pretty evenly split on what people believed about my girlfriend, but what felt right in my gut, was that she was planning something from me.  Many of you said I was denying any possibility she was cheating and had my head in the sand. That she was blowing this guy, fucking him in my bed, and that she was on some sort of penis-related carnival ride?   Some said I trusted her too much and that it would come back to bite me.  And many of you said I didn't trust her enough. That I was letting what my friend saw cloud my judgement.   There is some truth in that. Many of you wondered if Dave hated my girlfriend or wanted to get with her. I promise you that is not the case at all. Dave has been cheated on before and just wanted to look out for me. If I had asked him to confront her he would have done it in a heart beat, but even he thought something was up knowing us for as long as he has. I asked him to leave it and that I would deal with Everything when I got home. If there really was nothing going on, I didn't want to risk crushing her spirit when she was just trying to do something nice for me.  I let my girlfriend know I would be home sometime Wednesday...but I was gonna have breakfast with my family first. She requested I call her when I get in the state.   This was my intention, but I was getting so homesick, and I just really needed to see my girlfriend, so I hit the road sometime around 5am. With no rest stops and minimal traffic, I made pretty great time and got home at 10:30 or so.  As I pulled into the driveway, I saw the white truck parked there already.  I swallowed the lump in my throat and walked up to the front door. I kept repeating in my head that I trusted her and that there was nothing going on. As I walked in the front door (which enters into the living room) I locked eyes with the guy. He was sitting cross-legged on the floor in sweat pants and a tank top eating cereal off my coffee table. He looked younger than I thought he would be from Dave's description. But he had a full beard and long black hair in a ponytail. He nodded and said, ""hey dude. Welcome back.""  Which felt odd....I just stood there, staring at him, wading through the surrealness of the situation looking for the right words.  My girlfriend then came down the hallway, smiled, and hugged me.   ""Hey. I'm so, so sorry about grandma. Any chance you remember my cousin Max? I know It's been awhile.""  I stared at him and I swear I had never seen this person in my life. I just had this sinking feeling and only replied, ""I don't think we have met....""  ""Aunt Ellen's son. The one that lives in (other state).""  And suddenly it dawned on me. Her aunt Ellen's husband, Uncle Joe, was her SECOND husband. She married young but split up with this kid's father pretty early.....Max lives with his dad in (other state) and Max's dad is 100% Italian.....which explains the hair.  All I could say was, ""whoa man. You've grown up....""  He just laughed and said ""yeah. I've changed a bit.""  The last time I saw this kid he was a chubby, neon green haired, acne covered teenager in an tapout t-shirt. He really came out of puberty well....I Think I last saw him four or five years ago on Christmas.   She asked me if we could talk. So I followed her into our bedroom. She basically said he was moving back in with aunt Ellen and getting a job as a grunt with her family construction company part time. He wants to go to a local college around us and my girlfriend promised to help him fill out his FAFSA, polish his entrance letter, and study for his placement tests in exchange for some work. (He went to an alternative trade school for carpentry his last two years of highschool and my girlfriend's dad says he did pretty well.)   She said she had something planned for my man-cave but they hit a few hang ups and it's taking longer than expected.   She brought our x-box upstairs into the living room and has made me swear I will not enter the basement for any reason until my birthday.  I debated pretending I wasn't worried at all....but I like that we are always honest with each other. I told her Dave saw her out with her cousin and had me a bit worried about him. She just laughed and said, ""I didn't realize he saw us together! I thought you meant he just saw me."" She said they had walked basically around opposite ends of the store shopping separately. They only met up to check out. She asked why I didn't just ask her who it was. She said could have told me it was Max and still been able to keep the exchange of work under wraps and just told me about the college thing.   I basically told her I didn't want to make her feel like I was accusing her of anything, which I think she appreciated.   Max is going to be staying here a few more days longer than she planned, which I wish she would have told me about....but after this....that seems like nothing at all. I think she is a bit upset that I could even think for a moment she would cheat on me....but she said she was glad I didn't come flying home early kicking doors in or anything.   So I think we are good. Just in case, I'm gonna kiss her ass for a awhile. **edit 1:** maybe I should clarify that max is NOT moving in with is. He is moving back in with his mom. He was already supposed to be home with her by the time I came home...but they hit some snags with whatever he is working on. He is staying a few more days to finish up then going home to his mother's.  **Edit 2:** For those asking why my girlfriend would not tell me why Max was over, she didn't know Dave saw her WITH him, she just thought he saw her in the paint department by herself. I think she wanted to not arouse any suspicion at all in me. He was supposed to be done before I even got home.  I remember her mentioning that he was in carpentry school. I didn't know it was part of a two year high school thing, and for some reason I was picturing him as a lot older than he was (I think I had him confused with his older step brother?).  I've had my brother over when she was visiting her best friend out of state before and it was a non issue. We have a pretty open door policy when it comes to close friends and family so having him over is a total non issue for me.  I see how it would be an issue for some people. But it's not in our relationship. I think she just wanted me to spend time with my family and not focus on what was going on at home in the slightest.  She was going to tell me about the FAFSA/college thing If I asked, but since I didn't, she just decided to keep it under wraps.   ---    **tl;dr**: Everything worked out.",Whew. Glad it all worked out well with your lady! Though I'm very sorry about your grandmother :-(,1160
2sak4u,"She has been my sister-in-law for a year and we have never gotten along. She has always been rude and condescending to me. My husband wanted to visit his sister the day (Monday), and I reluctantly agreed. I tried my best to be civil, but she kept picking fights. She eventually started a verbal disagreement about how my husband could have done better than me etc. I tried to keep my cool and ignore her, but she eventually started screaming and my husband had to tell her to calm down and intervene.  I ended up going to bed (their guest room) and my husband and her husband stayed downstairs watching TV while SIL did the dishes. I dozed off and was awoken a while later by someone touching my hair. I sleepily thought it was my husband and rolled around and saw SIL snipping my hair with scissors. I immediately pushed her away and she ran out of the room. I went downstairs and informed my husband and his brother and showed them the cut strand. They both said that SIL ""is immature and not let her get on your nerves"".  I do not understand how they can be so passive and not think this is a big deal?!?!?! Am I overreacting? This is NOT normal behaviour for someone who is nearly 40 and I am so angry that she cut my hair while I was sleeping. I told my husband that I no longer want to visit her and he told me that I was acting like a drama queen and sinking to her level. What do I do??  **TL;DR: Got into argument with SIL, woke up to her cutting my hair. Husband thinks I am being a drama queen.**",You SIL needs professional mental health help and your brother and husband are complete morons for enabling her behavior by telling you not to let her get on your nerves. Your husband is spineless and unsupportive and a total asshole for calling you the drama queen.,2890
2xdznt,"Original Posting: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2wx020/i_m21_caught_my_gf_f22_in_a_lie_that_would_have/ I'll begin with the easy part. A quick update I drove to my ex's parents' house on Tuesday and took her the rest of her stuff.  It started out bumpy because her dad met me on the driveway and argued with me about what he sees as my sister being a spoiled brat and turning me against his daughter.  As soon as I started losing it and raising my voice my ex ran out and sent him inside the house. I told her we're over and I'm moving on.  She made some empty threats but I just told her to do what she has to do and walked away.  That night I took the suggestion repeated here to take my sister  for ice cream and apologize.  She chose Frugos instead (as usual) so we went there and I explained how sorry I was and that I will be better.  I told her that I totally believed her.  She was happy to hear everything I had to say.  It makes a huge difference to a child when you give a sincere apology I could tell.  She even texted a couple of her friends to gloat that my ex was gone. Okay now the hard part. On Wednesday I took her to the park to kick the soccer ball around and to have an overdue talk with her.  I asked her about my ex and she told me that she was mistreated by her more than I knew about.   She had a lot to say about her time at mom's house during the time when I was away.  I didn't know how hard it was for her when I enlisted and left.  That was hard to hear.  It was kind of a move to get myself out of a situation with zero thought to leaving her behind.  The short version is that we have all failed her badly.  She didn't say it but just everything she has to say about how things have gone down around her made it clear. When I was first discharged I got good job working for the city.  But I was drinking every weekend and my house was the hang out spot for my friends and that's how I met my ex.  I was even drinking on a lot of week nights.  I didn't immediately take my sister with me even though I knew about how my mom was living.  My wake up call was when my sister called me because the cops were there looking for mom to question her, and her boyfriend.  That was when I finally cleaned up, rented a house close to my sister's school and brought her to live with me. She doesn't remember that I waited so long to bring her with me.  She remembers it as if I acted quickly which is totally false and makes me look way better than I was.  It was really shocking and brutal to hear things from her perspective.  She has been through more than I can have imagined.  She is a very strong person. So definitely no more girlfriends for me for a long time.  That was an emotionally expensive lesson to learn with everything that my sister had to go through while I was being blind and dumb.  I'm going to wait and literally become a monk until she is in college.  She gets so many straight A's with some B's here and there.  She has a bright future.   EDIT:  I'm sure I'll date someday again.  Right now I'm not ready, not even close.  I might be a few months away from changing my mind but a couple of years is more likely.      **tl;dr; My girlfriend was mean and awful to my sister.  I broke up with her.  She's gone forever.  My sister and I are closer and I'll be better. **  ","You don't need to wait to date until she is in college.  But treat this as if you are a single parent dating.  Wait to introduce people to her until you have a really good feeling about them, not the honeymoon three months in thing, but REALLY get to know them.  Let them know up front that she comes first, just like any good parent, because you are her parent.  You can have a GREAT dating life while parenting her.  It will just be different.  You'll look for other qualities that you didn't even know were important to you.  You've done great, and your sister is amazing.",2225
2yywvd,"I'll try to make this brief.  My husband, Jonah, passed away unexpectedly a month ago from a stroke.  I don't want to get specific about that part, it's the worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life, and I'm still not sure how I'm ever going to move on. We were married for 5 years, together for 7.  The past 2 years we've been trying for a baby, but were just getting to the point of considering IVF when he died. Jonah had a close friend in high school named Marjorie.  Marjorie also ended up going to the same university as he did, and they spent a lot of time together during those college years.  Jonah said that he liked Marjorie's company, but never felt anything beyond friendship with her -- which I totally believe.   Jonah dated other women during that period, but told me that several times Marjorie hinted that she wanted him to ask her out.  She also ""joked"" about wanting him to be her ""plan B"" in case she didn't meet someone and get married by 30.   By the time I'd started dating Jonah, he had moved a couple hours away from his hometown (and Marjorie).  Despite this, Marjorie immediately began finding excuses to come to our town and ""hang out"" -- which usually involved her encouraging us to go drinking, and then her passing out on the couch at Jonah's apartment.  I didn't mind her for the most part, but she had a habit of saying things like, ""you know you ruined our marriage pact, haha!"" and pointing out all the things that she knew about him (like what he took in his coffee, his favorite bands, etc). Over the course of our relationship, and especially after we got married, Jonah definitely put some distance into his relationship with Marjorie.  He confided in me that he felt he had ""outgrown her"" and that they really had little in common anymore.  He stopped responding to her invitations to hang out as often, though he would occasionally call to catch up out of guilt (especially when she would text him or leave messages saying she was ""so sad he was ignoring her"" and the like). But now he's gone.  I had him cremated, like he wanted.  We haven't done the memorial service yet -- it was too hard for me to even imagine the first couple of weeks, and I also wanted to give time for some out-of-state people to make travel plans.  The memorial is this weekend. However, two weeks ago, I received an email from Marjorie -- sent to around sixty people, including Jonah's family -- saying that she was holding a memorial service for Jonah in the town where they grew up (the day before his memorial here).  I was completely blown away, seeing as she hadn't mentioned anything to me or even attempted to call.  Along with the details, the email said that she was ""planning the memorial in light of the fact that no other service had yet been held in his memory, and he deserved to be laid to rest with honor"".  For the record, she was invited to the memorial which I've been planning, and knew it was happening. I called her, of course, and told her that while I appreciated her willingness to help with Jonah's goodbye, I was already planning a service for him that would involve all of his family and friends.  She immediately went on the defensive, and said that she had ""only started to plan a service when she realized I wasn't willing to do it in a timely manner"".  I told her that the timing wasn't her choice to make, but that if she wanted to have a memorial of some kind, to please just add on the invitation that his ""official"" memorial was going to be held this weekend.  She said fine. I sent a message to all of Jonah's invited friends/family to make sure that they knew the real service with both of our families was going to be here, and then just washed my hands of the whole thing.   This week I received a message on facebook from Jonah's cousin, saying that Marjorie (who has apparently blocked me on facebook) created an ""event"" for Jonah's ""official"" memorial service (her memorial) and invited everyone she possibly could.  I've been getting blown up with emails asking which day the memorial is, and where.  I'm honestly furious -- I don't have the emotional energy to deal with this.   I ended up putting a post up on my wall, reiterating the date of his service here, and asking people to please share it.  Thankfully I think the older members of the family don't use facebook or email very often, so most of them haven't been confused, but a lot of people now think that Marjorie's service is the real one. I called Marjorie again, asking her to add an addendum to her event saying that his actual memorial was going to be here.  She told me that ""Jonah would have wanted it this way"" and that ""if I couldn't appreciate her efforts, I wasn't invited to say goodbye to Jonah.""  I told her that was fine, seeing as I'd already said goodbye to Jonah when I held him as he died.  She hung up. Apparently she's now spreading information to her mutual friends with Jonah, saying that he was planning on leaving me because I wasn't able to conceive.  She also said that we had approached her to carry a baby for us -- all absolute lies.  His cousin sent me a screenshot of a text where she said that ""Jonah always thought we would have the cutest baby together"" and that ""AngryWidow doesn't understand how much he wants children"". I'm at a loss as to what to do.  I don't care what she says about me, but she's now tarnishing my husband's memory -- especially saying that he wanted to divorce.  Jonah would never have left me, and anyone that knows him at all knows that we were committed to each other above all else. I need to figure out how to tell this woman to fuck off without encouraging her to spread more lies.  And I also want to just forget the whole thing and crawl in bed and never get up again. Help me, please.      **tl;dr**: My husband's former ""best friend"" is trying to plan his entire memorial service and is tarnishing his memory.  How do I get her to stop?","Can you deputize another friend or family member to take over Morjorie-handling for you?  Someone to text and facebook everyone, set the record straight when she sends out some message, show up to her memorial and talk to people, etc?  Basically, someone to shield you from her? The best way to deal with a Marjorie is to tell people close to you the truth, and let them disseminate it.  The people that matter won't believe her. If nothing else, I think that people will realize that her memorial isn't real when you're not there.  That sort of detail sticks out.",1937
2z99ea,"Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2yywvd/my_28f_husband_36m_passed_away_and_now_his_best/ I apologize for not updating sooner, but a lot happened the last couple of days.  Thank you to everyone who offered help and advice.  For those that offered monetary assistance, Jonah and I were in a stable position financially -- I'm going to be comfortable until I decide to go back to work.  Your willingness to help was deeply appreciated, however, and I'm truly bowled over by your kindness. I took the advice of the majority of comments, and called the chapel where Marjorie was planning her service.  I spoke with the pastor, who immediately told me that he had been trying to get in touch with me regarding the service -- apparently both Jonah and Marjorie had grown up in that church (I am not religious, and neither was Jonah as an adult).  My voicemail has been flooded, so it's definitely plausible that I overlooked his call.  He immediately expressed how sorry he was to hear of Jonah's loss, and said he had received my contact info from Jonah's great-aunt who still attends there.  He said he was surprised when Marjorie asked to have a service for Jonah, but she had claimed that Jonah and I were separated and I didn't want to be involved.  He had been trying to follow up with me, but obviously that didn't happen. He was very apologetic, and said that we could cancel the service, or move forward in any way that felt right to me.  He said that he knew the church members would appreciate the service, since many of them remembered Jonah as a boy, but obviously Marjorie would no longer have a role.  I agreed that the service could go forward. He called to speak with Marjorie after our conversation, and informed her that she was no longer welcome to participate in the organization of the service after her behavior.  He wouldn't tell me all that she said, but says she was distraught, and he recommended some mental health/spiritual services to her that he hopes she accepts.  She apparently apologized for lying, and asked to speak with me -- but I declined.  I feel bad if she's truly contrite, but I just have too much on my plate right now. We had two beautiful services for my husband -- first the one at his hometown church, and then the non-religious one that I planned.  Everyone that came wanted to honor Jonah, and that's all that really matters.  I was told a dozen stories about him that I'd never heard before, and I laughed so hard I cried, then cried some more.  My cousin was on the lookout for Marjorie, and I honestly didn't think about her the whole weekend.  She turned up for the first service, and the pastor ended up speaking with her (unbeknownst to me).  My cousin says he was sympathetic but firm, and told her that her presence there would be inappropriate.  Surprisingly, she left without fuss. I'm still not sure this situation is entirely resolved, but I got to lay my husband to rest in the way he deserved, and that's the most important thing to me right now.   Thanks everyone for your support.  **tl;dr**: Called the chapel, spoke with Marjorie, and had two wonderful services for my husband. [UPDATE 2]. I debated whether or not to even mention this, but this community has been so awesome I thought I might as well -- I realized this weekend that I'd missed my period, and I'm usually like clockwork.  It could just be stress, but I'm going to take a test later.  Can't decide if I'm incredibly hopeful or absolutely terrified. [UPDATE 3]. Not pregnant.  It was a long shot.  Thanks for your support.","You handled this situation graciously.  I hope she doesn't cause any further trouble, and leaves you to grieve in peace.  My thoughts are with you. ",2301

I wrote an e-mail to Dad and Claudette explaining my side of the story and why I didn't think it would work out.  --------- *E-mail* *I am unable to take Ariel on as a roommate, due to my increase in work hours and my internship this summer. I am doing well financially, so I don't need the additional rent I know Ariel would insist on paying. Here is the number for [Helpful Handicapped Student Center.] You will want to talk to Amelia H. She will put you in touch with the right people.*  *Best wishes,*  *Sophie.* -----  Claudette must have shown Ariel the e-mail, because I got a call two hours after sending it. Ariel had her rebuttal worked out.  - ""I will be more than happy to wait at campus for you to get off work.""  - ""Your mom is really helping you out, so you should extend the same hand to me. You should sacrifice for family.""  - ""We shared a room before.""  - ""It would be embarrassing to be a handicapped student on campus."" She wanted to be independent.  - ""[Claudette] has been really mean to me lately, saying I am not normal. I just want to prove her wrong. You understand, right?""  - ""I thought we were closer. It is you are healthy and I am not."" I ended up simply telling her-- ""My mom has asked me to pay her back for the apartment when I have the chance. I do not want to share a room with you and I do not feel we are close at all. On top of that, your mom ruined my parents' relationship, so I am not going to do her any favors.""

With everything we have done for you, I am hurt you won't consider helping out your handicapped sister. What happens when we die? Will you just leave Ariel and Sebastian all alone? ... We know you will be the successful child and we hope in our old age you will remember who helped you become the woman you are today. I replied telling them no.  I got a text from Claudette telling me to lose her number and that I was blocked. I haven't heard from my dad. I am not sure if I will. I am just kind of glad it happened. I have removed everyone from my FB and have their numbers tagged to go to voice mail. I am tired of playing games like this.    **tl;dr**: TL;DR-- I got an e-mail from Claudette. I told her no. She told me to lose her number. Thank you for your support everyone. I feel much better now. I don't have the emotional stability to be around Claudette and Ariel for long periods of time.

3245h6,"Our mom passed away when 7 years ago when I was 20, and my sisters were 11 and 10 (dad passed away 7 years before that). Since then, it's just me and my little sisters, although I get help from our grandparents and aunt as well. It's not been easy but I think we're fine in general and we're all a happy family. I tend to get advice when I need it and this is when I need advice.  We live in a moderate place (not US), it's not the most liberal area but also not the most conservative area either. My sister came out as a lesbian last year and it's been a very smooth process actually. People close to us are generally very understanding and people who aren't really need no reason to be close to us. She hasn't had any problems at school about this until yesterday. She's dating a girl (very nice girl, I know her parents) and apparently the sports coach noticed this. She asked if she's the girl who lives with her brother, and when my sister said yes, she basically said that ""poor you, things like this can happen when kids don't have proper parents"" in front of some other students. She was shocked and said her if she can elaborate. The coach said ""it's not your fault honey, when you don't have a mother figure shit like this happens. They shouldn't give hothead boys custody of teenage girls. A real family should have adopted you when your mom died."" My sister was angry and said in front of everyone that she should try to be a better mom herself before making comments about other people's parents, that they all know her daughter is a junkie and give guys blowjobs for a joint. She kicked my sister out of the sports class. I have confirmed that this is happened from a couple of her friends parents (that's exactly what my sister told me as well). I was planning to call the school today but they called me earliest thing in the morning themselves, asking me to come in person to discuss my sister's ""behavior"". I'm genuinely pissed off that a school staff made such a comment to my sister, let alone making comments about the quality of parenting that my sisters are receiving. I don't know how I should approach this issue. Any help is much appreciated.     **tl;dr**: Homophobic sport coach said my sister's homosexuality is because of ""lack of proper parents"". My sister said that her own daughter is a junkie and now the school wants to see me to talk about her behavior.",I'd approach it by demanding to speak with the principal and the teacher involved.

She texted both of them from my phone telling them that it was her that was texting, and told her that a friend would be by at a certain time to pick up my stuff tomorrow, and she told him that I would be by tomorrow to grab some things and that I was going to try to get out of the lease by talking to my landlord.** **I want you all to know that I've read through each and every one of these comments, and that I've read through every message that's been sent to me on here. I plan on replying to a couple tonight or tomorrow (I'm really tired, but wanted to let you all know how much you've helped me).** **Finally, to the people that have been in the same position as I'm currently in, or to those that have been in a situation even relatively similar, I have a couple things. First, none of what your ex-SO did, says anything about you. It tells what kind of person THEY are; your reactions tell the kind of person that you are. Secondly, all of you are MUCH stronger than you realize. Many of you have given me such amazing advice, and you know exactly where I'm coming from. Talking about it isn't always the easiest, and many of you did to try to help an internet stranger, so thank you. Finally, many of you have much greater things to look forward to. Like one of old teachers said, ""it's like moving on to the next book in the sequence. Yeah, you may have to wait a little bit for the author to release it, but it's worth the wait.""** **Also, to the kind individual that gave me gold, thank you. I plan on donating $5 tomorrow to a charity because of you. For anybody else that would like to, pick your favorite charity, and donate, or just do something nice for somebody else, it can have a huge impact on their life.** *EDIT: I'm at my best friends house. Him and his sister have been super awesome to me. Their doorbell rang about 5 minutes ago. It was her. His sister bitched her out. I wanted to go yell at her, but I started drinking fireball instead. It's going to be a long couple weeks until school gets out.* Throwaway, my girlfriend and roommate reddit. My last class of the day was cancelled, so I decided to come home and surprise my girlfriend. I went to the store and grabbed everything to make her favorite meal (lasagna). I was carrying the bags up the stairs and put them down in front of the door to fish my keys out of my pocket and then I heard my girlfriend moaning. I thought that she was ""taking care of herself"" because I know that she likes to do that sometimes when I'm not around, so I didn't have a sudden ""ah-ha"" moment or anything. I walked in and there were her and my roommate on the couch. I opened the door and kind of just froze when I saw it. She looked up and me and he turned around and saw it was me, and I just saw red. As much as I wanted to, I didn't kick his ass. I just dropped the bags and walked away. As I was getting into my car, they both came running out and yelling at me to stop, but I just floored it and got out of there as quickly as I could. I called my best friend and talked to him about it. He offered to come kick his ass, I told him no. I didn't want him to get in trouble from it. I even had the engagement ring that I planned to use to propose to her this summer when we went on vacation. It's in my safe that I keep in the closet, so I know that she doesn't know about it. But I planned to spend the REST OF MY LIFE WITH HER! Why didn't I see this coming? My last class was supposed to start at 12, but since it was cancelled, I was home by 12.30. So it's been 4+ hours. My phone has been blowing up from both of them, I haven't looked at any of the messages or answered any of the calls. I called my bank and made sure that she wasn't on any of my accounts for anything. I'm going to go back later tonight and pack up all of her stuff and drop it off at her place tomorrow. Then I'll probably take a bag of clothes to my friend's house and stay there until school ends (3 weeks). What do I do next?     **tl;dr**: Found girlfriend having sex with my roommate. I left. Already made sure she wasn't on my bank accounts. Had no contact with either of them. Have a place to stay until school ends.","Thank god for that class being cancelled or you could have been stuck with her for much longer. Now is when you begin to heal. After you drop off all of her stuff - be sure to go no contact with her. Block her on all social media, block her number. Make sure your friends know to not relay any information about her to you. Then you need to keep yourself busy with school or work. Dive into your hobbies or find new ones. Start working out, take cooking classes, go to yoga. Surround yourself with friends and family. Try to fill up all your free time as much as possible. It'll be hard at first, but it gets easier with every day.",3151
36d73i,"UPDATE TO http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36618q/i_found_out_my_boyfriends_19m_surprise_present_to/ Well, I've had an eventful 24 hours. So to recap: on the 16th, my best friend Sara, who is friends with my boyfriend Alex, decided to warn me that my boyfriend was going to take me skydiving for my birthday, to which I completely freaked out about. So I read through everyone's responses. Towards the end I was watching videos of first time skydivers over and over again, trying to psych myself up to do it, since I decided I'd probably regret it if I didn't go (even if I had a panic attack on the way there.) Alex came over the night I posted––I didn't mention the skydiving to him exactly, but I did reiterate and try to explain how bad my fear of heights was––and he was acting rather odd about it. He understood it completely, but just smiled and said, ""Don't worry about it, we'll get through it together."" He then took a really quick exit. I tried getting in touch with Sara, but she wasn't picking up her phone; she just texted me to come over at night. So later that evening (on the 17th, the day before my birthday) I went over to Sara's, who lives in the same building as me. A few of my girlfriends/future flatmates were there. We chilled for a while, I talked about how terrified I was to skydive but that I'd decided I would give it a try. Sara had a weird, half-amused look on her face, and just replied, ""Oh it'll be over soon! He just wants to help you get over your fear!"" Then around 11 PM I got a random text from Alex telling me he was coming over. He came over to Sara's and the two of them couldn't stop giggling. At midnight on the 18th they both wished me a happy birthday… then Alex said, ""So, Sara told me you already know what I'm going to get you."" To which I replied, ""Yeah?"" And then Alex said, ""Well, in about eight days, we're going skydiving from the highest drop in Europe."" I started visibly freaking out at this point. Alex and Sara burst into laughter. Then Sara said, ""Fuck, I can't keep this up anymore, I feel so bad. We're joking. We wanted to scare you!"" Alex grabbed my hand and he said, ""Of course I wouldn't take you skydiving! I don't want to kill you! We just really wanted to fuck with you since we knew you were catching onto us… Your real present is around the corner."" So I looked around the corner and there was a fishtank, all set up with a couple exotic fish, a heater, and a filter (just like I wanted)! My babies are safe and sound and I'm not getting pushed out of an airplane, reddit! He apologised profusely and said (since a few days earlier I was beginning to to catch onto the idea that they were getting me fish) that he wanted to make sure my present was a surprise and that he had no idea how deep my fear was. He said he was extremely sorry he'd ever caused me to freak out like that, but that he was never planning on taking me skydiving. Now Alex is taking me to the Natural History Museum and we're gonna go for bubble tea and pancakes. I'm thrilled to pieces. This has been a really good birthday. **TL;DR: I'm not getting pushed out of an airplane. Instead I get adorable fish. I love my life.**",Thank you for cheering me up on a gloomy day.  I hope you have a fantastic birthday and your fish enjoy their new home.,1500

If this is against the rules, let me know and I'll remove it! [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32m5lj/i_22m_just_walked_in_on_my_girlfriend_21f_of_7/) [First Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33aypy/update_i_22m_just_walked_in_on_my_girlfriend_21f/) Hey everybody. I've been asked multiple times for an update, but it's been super busy, and I actually have a little time today, so I thought I would update everybody on my situation. My ex made a doctor's appointment for a couple of days after my last post. She sent me a text with the date and time, and asked me if I would be going with her; I told her that I wouldn't but that I wanted Emily to go with her. She straight up refused and said this was ""our baby"" and that if I didn't go, she would cancel the appointment and wait until I was ready to go. We argued for a little bit until I gave in. I told her that I would meet her there, and I would stay for the entire thing, but I was going to be stone silent the whole time unless the doctor asked me a question. Her appointment was at 9.15 that morning, I showed up at 9.10 and sat across from her in the waiting room. The doctor called her back a couple of minutes later. They talked for a couple of minutes, she asked her some questions, and then she had her go to the restroom to pee in a cup (I made sure that her purse and everything stayed in the room - somebody warned me she would be crazy enough to buy a pregnant woman's pee and use that instead). After she gave the cup to the doctor, the doctor left and then she tried to talk to me. I sat there and ignored her and texted my friends until the doctor came back and confirmed that she was pregnant. I started shaking and tried to control my breathing, but my ex was so excited, and the doctor was excited with her. Then came the ultrasound, and my ex was roughly 11 weeks pregnant. After a couple of minutes, I excused myself and left. I texted her as I was leaving that before anything else happens, we're having a paternity test. First off, Noninvasive Prenatal Testing is super expensive. I told her that I would pay for half, but that if the child wasn't mine, then she would have to pay me back for that. She told me that her parents were willing to pay for it. Her parents have more money than I would know what to do with. Like... millionaries money. I told her that my ex-roommate was taking the test as well. She said that he didn't need to and I snapped saying that, ""I guess I can wait another 6 months. Because they won't put my name on the birth certificate until they prove I'm the father."" She finally agreed with me and made him take the test as well. There's a place around here that actually specializes in DNA testing, so we were able to get in just a couple days later. SHE BROUGHT HER MOM WITH HER! They told us that they would have the results in 10 days and that we could come pick them up or they could mail them to us, we said we would pick them up in person. I was too nervous to go to the results. Emily and Trevor both went in place for me. According to them, my ex wasn't happy that I wasn't there and almost refused to let them see the results, but her mom told her that she could understand why I didn't want to be there. I'll never forget that phone call from Emily E (Emily): Hey! M (Me): Well...? E: You're not the dad! You should have seen the look on your ex-roommate's face though! **He's the dad, I didn't make this clear. Sorry!** *At this point I squealed like a little girl.* My ex attempted to text me later and I just ignored all of them. Both of her parents did text me though saying that they wish me well with teaching. That really meant a lot to me. As for other things in my personal life... I've gotten a new apartment over by Trevor and Emily. My ex doesn't know where I live at the moment, her number is blocked, she's blocked on facebook, and everything else that I could think of to block her on. I've joined a summer baseball league and I play for that 2 times a week. I'm volunteering in the preschool classrooms on campus in the mornings. My job is giving me more hours (requested). I'm taking 3 summer classes, and I'm the ASL tutor for the summer classes now that they have started. I also bought a bike, and now I ride that daily as well. I also got a kitty. His name is Jasper. And I read a lot more now. I realize that I wasn't reading as much as I normally did while I was with my ex, but I've gotten back to reading! My friends are saying that I'm too busy now and that I have even less time than I did when I was with my ex. I like that. The busier I stay, the less I think about her, and the happier I am. There's a week between the summer classes that I'm tutoring this summer, and Emily, Trevor, Emily's best friend and I are going on a 5 day hiking/camping trip. I want to say thank you for everybody that helped me through this. The support that you've all given me has really helped me. There are still the people that are saying ""This isn't true"", but I'm receiving a lot more positive support than negative. No, Emily and I are not going to date. For the many people that have asked, I'm sorry to disappoint you and say that we're not. I don't see her in a romantic way, and I plan on staying single for a while. I'll be finishing up my BS in Elementary Education this upcoming school year, and then I still need to decide whether to continue schooling and pursue my MS in Deaf Education and Deaf Studies, or whether I should start teaching. **I'm sorry, I had to take the link down of Jasper. I was reminded that you are not allowed to post links.**     **tl;dr: She is pregnant! But I'm NOT THE DAD! Now to move on with my life**",would have been more fucked-up if your ex-roommate wasn't the father either... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),1004
37lkkv,"I've been seeing my therapist for about a year now and she's been helping a lot. I arrived in her office at our scheduled time and I was talking to her for about 15 minutes when she heard the waiting room door open.  She went outside and saw that the next patient had come an hour earlier and she thought that maybe she got our times mixed up until she checked the schedule andc saw that she placed them an hour after me. She told me that unfortunately I would have five minutes to wrap up because I would have to come back later, although it was **my** appointment time.  I fought really hard to hold back tears because I was in the middle of really pouring my heart out about how my sexual abuse. She gave me a rescheduled appointment but I don't know if I'm going back because it's a 40 minute walk from my campus. I usually don't mind but it's so hot and I don't want to do that walk twice today. She's been really great at helping me with my PTSD and overcoming my sexual abuse, but I feel that this was incredibly  unprofessional and it made me feel like what I was saying didn't matter. She told me that the patient was an evaluation so this would be her first time seeing them. Can you all give me advice on how to handle this? I've been feeling so shitty and my depression is getting worse and I really needed to talk about it because I feel like I'm close to just ending things.      **tl;dr**: Therapist sent me home in middle of appointment and I don't know if I should find a new therapist or if I'm overreacting.","You're not overreacting, what she did is wildly unprofessional and I'll bet you a doughnut that she charged you the full hour. I would speak with her, outside of your scheduled time, (in other words, don't pay her to discuss her flawed business practices), and tell her that you are not happy with the way she treated you and that you have informed your insurance company of the canceled session (NOTIFY THEM). Don't talk about how it made you feel because she has the upper hand there, couch it in professional terms. If she pushes back, is she really the person to help you develop coping skills and to set boundaries? ",2258
39wmlt,"My daughter died three weeks ago. My wife and I are obviously upset but we're coping. I'm posting this because I'm a little worried about her boyfriend. I've been back to her grave three times and he's been there every time. Just sitting there. The first two times I left, because I didn't want to bother him, but yesterday I went over and talked to him. We went to a bar and talked some more. I'm not going to pretend to know the guy, I had only talked to him 5 or 6 times prior to this. But he seems like the type of guy who keeps to himself, with not too many friends. He's also a bit of a nerd. He reminds me of myself actually, which is part of the reason I feel the need to help in some way. When we were at the bar he said a few somewhat alarming things , but these two stuck out: ""she was all I had... I have nothing left"" and ""I'm lost without her."" I suggested therapy, told him that it's helped me in the past, but he had no interest in it. I offered to let him stay at my house, I can't imagine its very nice sleeping in the apartment that she died in, but he declined. I'm not really sure what to do. He said things that made me think he might commit suicide, but I don't know him that well so I can't be sure. He just seemed so gloomy. Advice is appreciated.     **tl;dr**:Daughter [F20] died. What can I [M43] do for her boyfriend [M20]? **EDIT**: I posted this last night and went to bed hoping I'd get a few good posts when I woke up. This got quite a bit more attention then I thought it would haha. Thanks everyone for the responses! Also, thanks for the gold. :)","First, I'm very sorry for your loss.  It must be devastating to lose a child.  I think your empathy for this kid is amazing, given what you are going through.  But you are picking up on something important - you are equipped with the life experience to know that this phase of deep grief will pass.  There will always be a scar on your heart, but the wound will stop bleeding.  He seems to be drowning in it, with no light at the end of the tunnel. Can you contact his family as well?  Do you know any of the people in their circle of friends?  Reach out and let everyone know of your concerns. Even if you are overreacting, it is incumbent on you to alert those around him that he might be suicidal.  He should definitely be in therapy, even if it is a local church or YMCA/JCC Bereavement Support Group.  Make some phone calls, offer to go with him - you would benefit from it yourself.  He may be too grief-stricken to take action. **Take action.  You'd never forgive yourself if you said/did nothing and then something awful happened.  Good luck.**",4046
3a73jk,"Update to previous post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38tqzq/after_hanging_out_with_my_brother_30m_for_an/ So...y'all got so unexpectedly riled up about this! I seriously didn't expect to get so many comments, although I did read all of them. Made me look again at that night's events and how some of it might be hurtful/weird to an outsider's perspective. So thank you guys for that. The next morning, after breakfast, we were back in my bedroom, and I tried bringing this all up again. And he immediately looked uncomfortable and said, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry I mentioned all that stuff, can we just pretend I never said anything?"" And I was like, ""No, no, let's talk about this"" and I started launching into this whole prepared speech about my brother making me laugh super hard and using the bathroom when I was showering...and he just seemed really distracted and kept shooting looks at my bedroom door. I stopped and asked if something was wrong and he said, ""Look, can we maybe talk somewhere...not in your parents house? I'm just super paranoid they're going to knock on your door any minute."" Which kind of startled me again, but I said OK and we ended up walking to a nearby park and sitting on a bench for a while. So we ended up having a SUPER long talk, but here were the basic points. 1) His family was VERY VERY different from my family. I mean, he was an only child for most of his childhood, and when he got stepsiblings, they were all teenagers already and they moved into a house with a million bathrooms. So sharing a bathroom, family nudity, all that? A very strange and foreign concept to him. When my brother got up, knocked on the bathroom door, and then walked in after I gave him the OK, it just...really freaked him out. He didn't know what to make of that. And then I gave my side of the story, saying that, as he could clearly see from staying at my house, we DID NOT have three bathrooms when I was growing up. And while I'd say...for 90% of my showers, I got the bathroom completely to myself, every once in a while...you know, someone really has to go pee! I mean...that's it! It's just...not a big deal to me and family! And besides, once my boyfriend and I move in together, this will all be a non-issue anyway, right? My brother and I won't be sharing a bathroom again any time soon after that. 2) What he was TRYING to say about me ""dialing back"" my relationship with my brother was more like...he knows I spend a lot of time with my brother. Like, two or three days a week, not including all the time I spend at my parents doing family stuff (which is typically another one or two days a week). How much time was I planning on spending with my brother (and family) when he moved here? Was I going to be out five nights a week? Or was my brother going to be around our place all the time? Because that thought...really bummed him out and made him feel like he wasn't a priority. That made me upset. I never meant to make him feel like he wasn't a priority! But honestly, I hadn't really thought about how much time I was going to spend with family when he moved here. So we talked about that for a while, and expectations and boundaries were figured out. And no, I will NOT be out five nights a week with family and my brother will definitely NOT be hanging around our place all the time. 3) I apologized about my comment about how my brother was the only person who can make me laugh that hard. He got embarrassed again and said that there was nothing inappropriate about that, and he apologized for saying for phrasing it that way. But y'all were right: he was jealous. But he wasn't...REALLY jealous of how hard my brother made me laugh, although that was part of the reason. He was jealous that my brother and I can see each other whenever we want, but my boyfriend and I can't do that, since we're long distance. And he was jealous that I had such a tight relationship with my brother, and how my brother knew me so much better than he did. The only person in my boyfriend's life that knew him better than anyone else was me. But...he wasn't that person to me in my life. If that makes sense. I didn't really not what to say to that, so I said something like, ""I'm sorry, but...like, I don't really know what to say. My brother has known me for thirty years, and you've only known me for three. So yeah...he does know me better than almost anyone else, but that doesn't mean my relationship with him is 'better' than my relationship with you. It's just different."" He conceded that this was just a hang-up he needed to work out on his own. Which is...fine, but I still kind of feel like I botched the landing at this point in our conversation. :/ 4) AND FINALLY! I wasn't expecting this, but he told me that while he was really appreciative and grateful that my parents were letting him stay in their house, he...kind of really didn't want to stay with them when he was visiting me. Again, being around family all the time was a weird concept to him in general, but he also just wanted some privacy with me. He said staying at my parents house made him feel like a teenager sneaking around with his high school girlfriend again. He really wanted to stay in a hotel, he actually brought that up with me a few weeks before he came out to visit, but I scoffed at the idea. I was totally thinking in terms of money, the idea of privacy didn't even cross my mind. ""Why would you want to stay in a hotel? You can just stay at my parents house with me!"" He then said something about making too much noise and distracting them and I was like, ""Pish posh! Don't be silly, my bedroom is all the way on the other side of the house, they can't hear anything. My parents are so excited to see you! My dad really wants to show you the fig tree he planted and blah blah blah --"" And he was just like, ""Yeah, OK, you're right. We should save money."" He didn't want to object or make waves because he thought that would hurt my feelings. But I kind of felt like a colossal idiot for not realizing what he was actually trying to tell me, so I apologized for being so thick. Although, I did say something to him like, ""Look, I sometimes forget that not everyone likes being around my family as much as I do. Please, please, please tell me if you're ever feeling overwhelmed by them, or want to be away from them, or anything like that. I get it! It won't hurt my feelings!"" So we actually pulled out our phones and looked up some hotels in our city right there in the park. We found a somewhat expensive one near downtown, but I was like, ""Whatever, I'm making bank at my job and I basically have no bills to pay since I'm living with my parents, let's stay there!"" Which made my boyfriend stupid happy! We went back to my parents' house and while he was packing his bag, I told my parents that we were going to go crash at a hotel for the rest of my boyfriend's visit. They both started to object, but when I said, ""Well...we'd just really like some privacy,"" they understood. Well, my MOM understood. My dad just kept saying, ""I don't understand why you're spending money on a hotel when you have a perfectly good bed right here."" So...I think that's where I get some of my thick-headedness. We had an amazing few days together at the hotel. Oh, and there was this super cute moment that I'm just going to share with you guys even though it's cheesy...We somehow got back on the topic of my brother knowing me for three decades. And at one point, I jokingly said something like, ""If you don't know me as well as my brother does after we've been together for 30 years, then that's your fault, not mine."" And then he got all quiet for a second and got a cute little smile on his face and was like, ""You think we're gonna be together in thirty years?"" And I...blushed a little and said, ""I'd...really like to be."" And he said, ""I'd really like that, too."" Which made me all...warm and happy inside. Anyway, I think that's everything. It was just a combination of miscommunication and growing up in very different familial backgrounds. He should probably be moving here in the next two-ish months, and I SERIOUSLY CANNOT WAIT OMG. It's going to be so great, I cannot wait until he gets here, it's going to be so so so great. :D tl;dr: Talked a bunch with my boyfriend, agreed that we both come from very different families, then partied like ballers in a hotel for a few days since I'm fluuuuuuush with caaaaaaaash.",What a heartwarming post.

3as7za,"OP: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3am0dc/my_fianc%C3%A9e_24f_has_no_bridesmaids_and_its_making/?sort=new Did not expect to update this fast.  Did not expect to update at all, unless something miraculous happened.  And it did. In short, I have the best friends in the world. I read through a ton of these comments, but not all (over 1000?!)  and decided to look for my fiance's box of wedding planning stuff, because I had a suspicion.  Inside the box was all these magazine clippings of a big church wedding, flower ideas and stuff.  And then I saw pictures of the dresses.  They were all big, poofy ornate things that don't seem akin to my fiancee's style at all.  But...they're similar to the dresses my sisters wore at their weddings. It all sort of clicked for me.  My fiancee probably doesn't want a church wedding or any of these fancy trimmings, she's trying to win my family's favor.  The hell.  I really should've noticed this earlier and gotten more involved, I know. My fiancee flew home on Thursday to spend a few days with her dad (Father's Day weekend and all).  I couldn't go because of work, so I was alone until this morning.  So, real late at night, I called up my buddy Ravi (26M).  Ravi's my best man, we've known each other since we were kids, split up when we went off to college, and reconnected three years ago.  We moved to SC so I could join the company he works for.  I just opened up to Ravi.  It was really late but he listened to me anyway, about my worries about my fiancee.  He said that it was very likely that she was trying to curry favor with my family, but she probably wasn't going to admit to it easily.  He said he'd talk to her. I told him that he barely knows her.  He said not to worry, and that he'd be around tomorrow evening. My fiancee came home happy (she always is after seeing her dad) this morning.  I went off to work without asking about the wedding, and she set to work on her writing (she's off for the summer).  I got home early and at like 5 PM Ravi came to my house with my other good friends: Carson, Andrew, and Tim (23-30M).  I know all these guys from various places and we're all a solid group.  Still, this was unexpected. Ravi came up to my fiancee and said that the guys were taking her wedding dress shopping. We were both freaked out as hell.  I had no idea this was coming, and my fiancee looked like she wanted to crawl into a hole and die.  She whispered to me ""they won't like me"", and I urged her to just go for it.  Ravi reminded her that he has sisters, Carson's been divorced, and Andrew's had his fair share of girlfriends, so they know dresses.  Plus, he has a lady friend that works at a small boutique, where they'd try first. She still didn't want to go, and then he said something like ""hey, you're marrying our best friend, don't you think we should get to know you and make sure you're not a ghost or something?""  (He's not great with tact).  But she chuckled a little at that and gave in. They were gone for a while and came back an hour ago.  They didn't find a dress, but they looked around the stores for a while and fiancee found a style she liked (not the poofy ball gown style).  They also went out for ice cream and when they walked in the door, she was joking and laughing with them all.  I hadn't seen her so happy in a long time.  It was amazing. Then we all sat down together and Ravi asked her to talk to me about what's on her mind. I still don't know how they got her to open up.  She whispered that she didn't really want the big church wedding, that she wanted to wait a little while and plan a small ceremony for just the people we really care about.  I was all for it, I told her not to worry about bridesmaids or anything, it could just be us.  She said no, she wants her dad, the guys, and my family to be there.   Andrew, a kickass guitar player, said he'd put together a band for us.  He asked my fiancee what her favorite song is, he'd figure out an arrangement.  This is the kind of question she usually dodges, but she blushed a little and actually told the truth.  (Panama by Van Halen if anyone cares; girl knows how to rock out).  This was the real sign that she's starting to trust them.  I don't think anyone knows her favorite song except me and her dad (who bought her Van Halen CD's growing up) I told her I'd call my family and tell them the church wedding's off.  If they make a big stink about it, I don't fucking care.  I have my bros and my beautiful future bride.  That's all the family I need.     **tl;dr**: Church wedding's off, my friends are awesome, future looks bright so far.",You have some damn awesome friends :) ,3164
3bgrmt,"Edit: [OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bc8ia/i_19m_had_a_gay_experience_with_my_friend_19m_i/) I'm getting a lot of update requests, and Danny just headed home so I figured I'd go ahead and post. I have exciting stuff to tell you guys! First I wanted to say thanks to everybody who commented, you all really helped me calm down and stop overthinking everything. I appreciate it a lot. When Danny showed up we were both really nervous and awkward at first. I was really scared to say anything, but I broke the tension by telling him how much I had enjoyed the night before. He broke out into a huge grin and turned bright red, lit up like a christmas tree. He told me he was so relieved, and that he had been obsessing over it all night worried for the same reasons I had been.  I told him that it was my first sexual experience ever and that I was questioning my sexuality now. He told me that he had been questioning his sexuality for a while, and that he had feelings for men before, but had mostly seen me as just a friend until last night, when he realized that I was kind of sort of coming onto him in a really roundabout way. It's funny, I didn't really think of myself as coming onto him but I definitely made that statement hoping something would come of it... Anyway I told him that first and foremost I valued our friendship and wanted to stay friends whatever happened between us. He agreed strongly. He asked me if I was okay with working out our feelings together (read: having sex until we figure out how we feel) and I told him yes. After all this heavy conversation we decided to play some CS:GO together like we usually do but we ended up in bed together instead. Afterwards we talked some more and discussed the possibility of a relationship. He said he feels like we know each other well enough that he wouldn't feel like we were rushing in, and I agreed with him. He asked me to be his boyfriend, and I said yes! I'm so happy about it, too! I've never felt so attracted to anyone before. We haven't told anyone yet, but decided not to go out of our way to keep it a secret. The area we live in is reasonably tolerant and neither of our parents are anti-gay, which I am grateful for. I am worried about telling my sister, who has recently become a born-again christian and had a lot of horrible things to say about the supreme court ruling on FB. I'm also a little concerned about telling our other two friends, but I think after the initial shock wears off, they'll come around. Now, I'm not super duper concerned with slapping a label on my sexuality and calling it a day (thanks to you guys, I appreciate all the advice in that regard!) but the more I think about it, the more I think that I really am gay, or at least gay-leaning bisexual. It kind of feels like the best time to be realizing it with the gay marriage ruling happening. Every time I think about it I feel giddy.     **tl;dr**: Talked it out, sexed it out, we're a couple now! Thanks for helping me stay sane, reddit!","This reminds me of a joke. >They say one in every four men is gay, so there must be one in my group of friends. I hope it's Michael - he's super cute",1439
3bmrg6,"Me and my ex were together for about 6 years. We broke up a little over over a year ago after I found out she was having an affair. We have a 3 year old son together that I love more than anything in the world. She had primary custody of him because I feel like a child should never be torn away from his mother, unless the mother is abusive and/or can't raise him properly. Plus, I get to see him whenever I like. So yesterday afternoon, I picked up my son up from his mom's house to spend the rest of the day with me. She went out for drinks later with her friends. I thought nothing of it, because she has done this a ton of times.  I got a call around 11pm from one of her friends, a call that I never want to hear about someone I'm close with. According to her friend, she was super drunk and couldn't even walk properly. She ran out onto the street and a car hit her. She was rushed to hospital and she died on the way there. I'm in so much pain right now. I loved this woman. We have a beautiful child together. How will I eventually explain this to my son?       **tl;dr**: Ex-GF died after a car hit her. We have a child.",I'm so sorry this happened.  I strongly suggest talking to a grief counselor yourself and consulting a child-psychologist with regards to your son. They are trained to help you and your son deal with this.,2309
3cfcsg,"Hi Relationships, I'll try to keep this short and blunt. Please don't judge before you've read the entire thing, I promise I'm not as awful as I sound in the title.   I've been with Matthew for 3 years now, and we have a perfect relationship. I know everyone says that, but it really is true. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I've only met his family a few times because they live pretty far away and my boyfriend had a huge falling out with his father a couple of years ago. They've since patched things up, but it's still not the same as it was. Matthew is not particularly close to his sister because she's 12 years younger than him and he doesn't see her that often. Of course he still loves and adores her, but they're not a very close family. Jessica has cancer and as a result has lost all of her hair. Matthew was devastated, obviously, and has been going to visit her more often. I have only seen her a few times since, because of work commitments. I have been down twice alone (without Matthew) to visit her in hospital. She’s a lovely young girl and I’m devastated for her and their family.  Jessica is home at the moment and Matthew's mum called last Friday and asked if we could go over there. Upon arrival Matthew's mum whipped out a pair of scissors and shavers and said that the whole family was shaving their heads for Jessica. My job is modelling. I have very thick, natural auburn hair that reaches my waist. It's one of the reasons that I'm fairly successful. It's one of the reasons I can afford to pay the bills. I couldn’t model without my hair. So I respectfully and politely declined, telling them that it would be detrimental to my career. I don’t have two jobs, I don’t have a back-up, this is my job. It’s my money maker. If I couldn’t model, I don’t know what I would do.   Matthew immediately got angry, insisting that this is more important, and while I agree that sentimentally and emotionally this is far more important, I cannot afford to lose my hair. I have to think logically about this otherwise I won’t have a roof over my head. Matthew’s mum was very upset, and proceeded to tell Jessica that I wouldn’t shave my hair because I am vain. I apologised to Jessica and explained my reasoning, and I went home. I have barely spoken to Matthew since it happened as he says he ‘needs space to consider if he wants to be in this relationship.’ I told him that I would do anything other than shave my head. I'll do a charity run, I'll raise tons of money, whatever I can possibly do, instead of shaving my head, but he won't listen. All he says is 'how can you put your looks and vanity over my cancer ridden sister'.  Did I do the wrong thing?  tl;dr my career is modelling and part of my success is due to my hair. My boyfriends younger sister has cancer so the family shaved their heads in support of her. I declined, and now everyone hates me.  edit: a few people have asked so I'll copy+paste this from one of my replies: Matthew told me that Jessica is very upset and has told all of their family repeatedly that she hates me for having long hair and refusing to shave it for her. She's only 13 years old though, I have a feeling that the family are perhaps poisoning her view and of course she's going to be having a difficult time as it is. I can't hold any grudges against a young girl being in such an awful situation.  Edit 2: I'm completely overwhelmed by the support here, so thank you a lot. I have read every comment and most of them are very helpful and make me feel a lot better. I am going to give it another few days and then I am going to speak with Matthew and his mum and Jessica. I'll be sure to post an update soon. Thank you again.   *Edit 3: gosh I hate threads with a ton of updates when there's no real update but I feel the need to defend Matthew's family a little. They're not crazy people. They've always been absolutely lovely and kind and welcoming towards me. They were a normal, happy family before this happened. Their youngest member of the family, the innocent, sweet, vulnerable girl is dying and there's nothing they can do about it other than try to make her happy. Of course their view is clouded, of course they're not being rational. Matthew's mum has quit her job to spend more time with Jessica, they've spent every penny they have on gifts for her. I don't think they're crazy or bad people. They're in a world of hell and the only thing that makes it better is putting a smile on Jessica's face and me shaving my head would have done that. If they don't come to terms with it and start thinking clearly soon, then I will agree with everyone and I will call them crazy and run for the hills, but at the moment, I'm trying to be as supportive as I can to my boyfriend and his family whose hearts are all broken. Put yourselves in their shoes.*","I think something that needs to be said here is that even if your job didn't depend on your hair - is that it's still *your hair* and it's completely understandable that you don't want to shave it, for any reason. Yeah, shaving your head is a nice gesture, but there are plenty of other ways to be supportive without making a massive change to your personal appearance that will take years and years to reverse, as your hair is so long. It's not vain to be happy with the way you look and not to want to change it... Especially when the reason for changing it is ""emotional support"", which can be achieved in many other ways. ",3971
3d9ojx,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3czzes/me_29_m_with_my_gf_27_f_together_4_years_she_was/ First let me say that when I wrote my first post I was obviously in a very bad place.  That night's incident was very fresh on my mind and the pain I was feeling at that moment was more than I could handle.  I typed that out, which was cathartic to me, then decided to crawl into a bottle of Jim Beam.  I called in sick yesterday from work, which was not a lie as I had the hangover from hell and spent time alternating vomiting and laying with an ice bag on my head. I finally opened up reddit last night and to say that I was overwhelmed would be a massive understatement.  I could not believe the number of messages I had in my inbox.  I lost count to be honest with you but it was way in excess of 1 k.   Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  There were so many people who opened up to me about their own experience either being the victim or being the s/o of a victim.  Each of your story's touched me more than I could say.  One in particular got to me and I'm not going to lie I sat at my keyboard and cried for 20 minutes reading his story.  It was so eerily similar to mine that it was as if it was happening to me all over again.  However this was written from an older gentleman who went through virtually the same thing and had to make similar choices.  Thank you sir, I won't share any details since that was sent to me in confidence but you truly touched me. That all being said here I am today.  Although universally I was told I was not an asshole and not in the wrong it still doesn't feel right.  I feel like an absolute failure and that if I would have just been more assertive early on in the process that we could have changed things. I don't think I made it clear enough how much I loved and still love her.  Letting this relationship go is like saying I have to lose an arm. I haven't eaten any solid food since Sunday night, I know I have to quit drinking (yes I called into work again today) but right now feeling numb is better than what I feel like I have to do.   Before I go over my intentions I do want to clear up a couple of things.  As I said I wrote that while I was still very upset and hurt so I think I was probably either not clear enough or maybe painted a couple of people in a bad light. First to her parents.  Yes, I've known her parents since 3 weeks into our relationship.  They have never been anything but kind to me and we have eaten at their house twice a month since we have been together.  My family has always celebrated Christmas on Christmas eve so I have spent 3 of the past 4 Christmas's at her house with them.  I do not fault or blame them.  Their child was brutalized and traumatized so they circled the wagon around her, which while I do not have any kids I certainly understand that she was top priority to them.  Her Dad has been as hurt as anyone by this and I have been heartbroken to see this giant of a man (he's honest to God 6'6"" tall) broken like this.  Her Sister has honestly been my lifeline.  She has talked with me and has always tried to be as open as she can with me. Yes, they knew about the cheating and that is why I got the runaround.  No they did not support her decision to do this however they did not want to be involved other than be there for her.   Second her therapist might be incompetent, I have no way to judge that.  However in rereading what I typed I think I made it come out worse than it really was.  She did not try and excuse what she did nor did she try and justify it, like I implied.  After a few seconds of awkward silence that was only interrupted by my crying she said that ""some women"" do that.  Also I did read where some people thought it was the therapist who recommended she do this and that couldn't be farther from the truth.  My g/f told her in therapy what she had done and she is the one who convinced my g/f to tell me, they both agreed to do it there so she felt safe.   I just wanted to clear those two things up because I did not do either of them any justice. My g/f is/was my best friend.  I confided in her for everything.  I have some work associates that I am friendly with but I am hundreds of miles from where I grew up and all of my friends are there and either are married or very career driven so I don't have what you would call a real support network.  My sister has been there for me to a point but there is a real complication to that even.  My g/f and my sister are best friends, in fact its how I met my g/f.  So while my sister loves me and wants what's best for me she is also very sympathetic to her friend and doesn't want me to do anything to hurt either of us.  She does not support her in the cheating but has tried to basically smooth that over.  She does NOT know though that we (my g/f & myself) have not been together sexually since the rape.  Honestly that is none of her business and I think she would be really disgusted with me if I let her think that this even had anything to do with it. My g/f has been blowing up my phone with text's since Sunday night.  She is saying everything that I have wanted her to say since about a month after the rape.  I've gotten more ""I love you's"" in the past day than I have in the past year.  I've only responded twice to her.  So she does know I'm reading them. That is making the next part very hard to do.  I came to the decision last night/early this morning that for my own mental well being I can't do this anymore.  Believe me when I say that I know what a failure it is and how horrible it makes me feel. So here is my plan.  I know it is chicken shit on my part but I have typed a letter and I am going to send it to her therapist (along with a note to the therapist explaining what to do) for my g/f to read in her office.  That way there is immediate support for her.  I don't want her to be anymore abandoned than what I am going to be doing, that is heartbreaking to type btw. When she goes for her appointment Friday morning I will then send emails to her parents and a text to her Sister informing them of what is happening so that way they can be there for her when she gets out.   Here is word for word the letter I have written her, the only thing that is different is that I am no using her or her therapist real names here.  Please read it and let me know if I am out of line or if I am to cruel or if this will trigger any type of mental trauma related to her rape.  I have zero intention of inflicting any more pain than what is normal with a breakup. Dear Sara, I know that this is not the best way of doing this but honestly if I had to look you in the eyes I know I could not go through with this.  I have loved you since the first month we have been together and the first three years of our relationship were the best three years of my life.  You were my everything and I know that we had both talked about marriage a lot and I know and believe with all of my heart that we were going to be married. Nothing would have made me any more happy or proud than to be called your husband. I don't know how to say this because every fiber of my being does not want to say this but for my own mental health going forward I have to let you go.  Believe me when I say that decision did not come easily to me nor can I say that it is not heartbreaking on my end.  I have always and still love you, but I can't be with you anymore. You need to heal and you need to be able to 100% focus on you while you are healing and having to worry about me and my feelings is only getting in the way of your healing. I will always hate the bastard who did this to you.  He has ruined so many lives that life in prison seems a lot more appropriate than what he got.  But I don't get to make that call.  I know holding onto hate is not healthy but he has ruined my life as well as yours. I know you are going to hate me for this, I don't blame you at all.  I know that you feel abandoned but please understand I have done everything in my power to be there for you.  I wanted to be more involved in your healing but for whatever reason I was somewhat excluded from being a significant part of your inner circle.  This has left me feeling very lonely and alienated from you and your family.  I wanted nothing but the best for you and wanted to be there for you and I hope I was whenever you would let me. I won't lie, you seeking comfort in the arms of another while still to this day denying me any affection has weighed very heavily on me.  I did then and I do now forgive you but forgiving does not take away the soul crushing pain that comes along with that.  I understand to a point why you might have done it, I don't agree with it and I never will, but I maybe see why. However that has nothing to do with the fact that we are one year and a month past your incident and you still treat me as though I did something wrong or will do something wrong to you.  When you withdrew the other night from my attempt at a kiss I knew then that you were still in need of healing and I have no idea how long that will be.  But I can't put my life on hold indefinitely, which is where we are still.  I know it is very selfish of me but I need affection, I need both mental and physical intimacy.  Our conversations have been both generic and bland for the past year, which believe me I can understand why.  But we used to spend hours talking about our future and what we wanted.  Now at best we talk about what movie's we want to watch.   What I am doing is in no way because of what happened to you.  That event was horrible and was life changing for you and I never ever had a second thought about you because of it.  This is all about your recovery and how you have to heal.  For whatever reason, reasons you may not even know yourself, you have completely distanced yourself from me.  I've tried with all of my heart to get back to you but it is painfully apparent that I am no closer to you now than I was right after the incident. Also to be very clear so you do not think this is about anything else.  The is no one else.  I am not seeing anyone, I don't have eyes for anyone nor do I think anytime soon I will.  I am not now nor have I ever cheated on you. I hope with all of my heart for you to be fully healed soon.  I want you to be happy.  I hope some day you can look back on our time together with fondness and find it in your heart to forgive me. I will always love you, this breaks my heart more than you will ever know. Love, Chad ************************* Thank you again to everybody.  I know I type a boatload but it just feels good to get this out.   I have to have it to her therapist by tomorrow.  Now the question is do I have the fortitude to send it.     **tl;dr**: I have written her a letter and need advice",“I used to think the worst thing in life is to end up all alone. It's not.

3e4ih6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3czzes/me_29_m_with_my_gf_27_f_together_4_years_she_was/ https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3d9ojx/me_29_m_with_my_gf_27_f_together_4_years_she_was/ I have learned several things recently.  First thing is that I had no idea how many English teachers, lit majors and overall editors were actually redditors.  LOL, I had so many posts just correcting my obvious and admitted horrible spelling and grammar that I began to have a complex.  In all seriousness thank you for those of you who took the time to edit that for format, grammar and spelling.  I even appreciate those of you who took the time to provide me with written documentations and reasons as to why my errors were errors. Second thing I've learned is that this is really a loving and caring community for the most part.  I have been given numbers to call, emails to read and lists of things to read to help me on my journey.  I deeply appreciate the very moving stories I have been told and believe it or not I have read every one of them even though at last count I was close to 2,500 messages.  People have offered to buy me drinks, hang out and I even got one offer for a hand job to relieve my stress which was both flattering and amusing all at the same time. However the main thing that I have learned recently is to never sign your real name to an open public letter if you don't want it to somehow get back to the people in your life.  It makes it a little hard to deny it was you when every single detail is the same and you use your own dumb ass name. Many people wanted and update about how things went.  Simply put, it didn't. In review I had written the letter and then with the help of several redditors had re-written the letter with better format and I did edit out the part that the rapist ruined her because I agreed that this was not an appropriate thing to say.  In fact I almost edited him out altogether other than saying I wish he had gotten a longer sentence.  However I did leave in the part about being her husband.  I know a lot of people wanted me to take that out but I just felt deeply that I had to say that, I can't really explain why. Of course my intention originally was to mail it to her therapist office with instructions for what to say, but I knew there was zero chance that she would get it in time so I was going to take it to her and see if I could speak with her. Notice how that was all in the past tense as in what I was going to do? Well I never got the chance. Wednesday night, late night in fact, I have a knock on my door.  Lo and behold it is her sister and my sister together.  Her sister was holding papers in her hands and my sister walks in and her sister walks in with her.  Obviously something is up so I ask what's wrong and her sister hands me a print out of my posts and the replies to my previous two threads and she simply asks ""is this you""? At first I tried to deny it, I couldn't really remember everything I had written in particular the first post so I was kind of trying to avoid any problems if I said something I shouldn't have. But my sister just straight up got in my face and told me to stop fucking lying, which by then I was caught.  I knew and she new it.  I just dropped my head. This then led to a very long conversation that lasted till the wee hours of the morning.  At first her sister was very much emotional because of course she loves her sister and was crying asking me how I could want to do this to her.  Much to my surprise though my sister stood up for me here and actually kind of ripped her sister a new asshole.  She said that I had gone way beyond what most people had and that Sara should not one year later still be withholding affection from me.  She had no idea that we still weren't physically as close as we once were, like I said I never told her. Once my sister got done talking (I'm going to call her sister Susan just so I can stop typing her sister) Susan said that in reality she knew that she was right.  She begged me to not go through with my letter, she said that I had promised to give Sara a week (which I had).  She then gave a very impassioned speech about how much she can tell I still love her and how much she knows she still loves me.  My sister also agreed that there was too much love present in my heart to just do this right away.  She said and it made sense at the time, what is another week compared to what you have been through.  So long story short I agreed to not take the letter over. Whether it was guilt, regret or love I can't say but I agreed to it.  This then led the single most embarrassing thing in my life happening.  Susan gave me a very big hug and cried as they were leaving.  It's been a very long time since I've had any type of close contact and let's just say its not a lot of fun being called a disgusting pig by your sister.  All I could do was say how very sorry and how embarrassed I was, fortunately Susan seemed to take it in stride.  She just wanted to make sure that I would talk with Sara the next day. Even though I was a virtual zombie from lack of sleep I went ahead and went to work.  I have lots of PTO time available to me but I didn't want to burn it all up over this in case I needed time later. I got home from work and my intention was to go straight to bed after eating dinner and maybe watching some tv.  That went to hell in a hurry as I was eating my dinner when my someone is knocking on my door again.  This time is was Susan and Sara. This time Sara is holding the printout.  You can tell they both had been crying and Susan asked if they could come in.  I just shook my head yes because I was honestly a little nervous and no matter what she has done or not done, seeing Sara emotional always upsets me and she physically looked horrible.  I mean as bad as she did after the rape.   They set on the couch and sara already has tears streaming down her face.  We all kind of just sat there for what seemed like an eternity looking at each other.   I wasn't going to speak first, I had no idea what to say or do so I just sat there.  Eventually I broke though and asked Sara if she wanted some water or something to drink.  She actually said yes so I got up and went to the kitchen to get her a glass of ice water and when I turned around she was standing right behind me. All she said to me was ""are you really going to leave me""?  I couldn't answer, I just looked into her eyes and felt broken and ashamed.  We went and sat down but this time she sat next to me. She started to read my first post to me but could not make it through it. Susan jumps in at this point and say's they had spent the day talking and they had gone over the post and most of the replies and said that Sara was very sorry for how she treated me.  She said that they have spoken to their parents and everybody agrees that the way I was treated was not fair.  Seeing it in writing really struck a nerve with all of them because they could see how hurt I was and that even though I could have blamed all of them that I didn't.  Sara is shaking her head yes the entire time.   Sara then managed to talk and just laid out how she obviously did not give me enough consideration and that she now see's that what she did was horrible to me when I have been nothing but compassionate and loving towards her.  She begged me for another chance she said that sometimes in life you need a kick in the ass to get moving and she said me wanting to break up with her was her wakeup call.  She can't and won't take me for granted and said she had a years worth of apologizing to do to me.  Susan actually very calmly said that they had spoken at length in the afternoon about her infidelity and then not even touching me.  Sara then replied that she had no real excuses.  She knows that what she did was horrible and that she had no right to ask me for forgiveness but was going to anyway.  She also said that she is making it the top priority of her life that she talk with her therapist to get past any physical limitations she has with me. This went on for a long time btw.  I could give you a lot more of what was said but this is already a wall of text as it is. The one thing though that I want to say is that while she was talking to me she was holding my hand.  She reached out and took it.  Now I realize that she read my posts and I made a big deal about that in my posts but whether she did it because she read it or just did it on her own (she used to do that all the time) I won't deny that it felt really good. They ended up staying the night.  No, before you get any crazy porn movie ideas nothing happened between any of us.  Susan slept on the futon and Sara on the couch and I actually went to my bed. I called in early Thursday morning to work before I went to bed as I knew that I would not be able to function on so little sleep. I get awoken around 10 by Sara sitting next to me in the bed rubbing her hands on my arm to wake me up.  She said that they were getting ready to leave because she had moved up her therapy session to 11 and she didn't want to leave without her telling me how much she loved me and to let me know she was coming right back after the session.   She leaned over and kissed me.  It wasn't a long passionate kiss in fact it was just kind of a quick kiss but right on the lips.  This was a mistake I'm sure because that broke my resolve right there.  Up until that point I was still holding onto the thought that this was all just words and that it took me threatening to leave her to get her to even pay attention to me.  One p.m. I got from a rape survivor kept going over in my head that if she was able to come around because of the threat of me leaving then this was not all due to her emotional trauma because if it was due to that then no threat of me leaving was going to change this. But between my sister, her sister and her every wall that I was building to protect myself was crumbling and that kiss pretty much was the wrecking ball that tore them all down. I went back to sleep and around 1 she shows back up at my  place carrying lunch.  Susan was not in tow so it was just going to be the two of us.  We ended up spending the afternoon together.  We ended up spending the weekend together.  Yes you can infer from that what occurred between us.  I'll just say that I was probably more scared about it than she was.  I was worried about triggering anything or saying or doing anything that would upset her.  She on the other hand was very loving and emotional about it.  She cried afterwards for a good long while which caused me to freak but she said it was a combination of joy and regret.  That she had forgotten how love felt and it just kind of overwhelmed her.  We laid there for hours. She had the recommendation from her therapist for a couples counselor who we are going to start seeing next week. I know this isn't what a lot of people wanted to read and all I can say is that I'm sorry to disappoint you and yes I am prepared for the plethora of name calling from some people but at the end of the day I have to worry about myself and my happiness here. For the first time in over a year I have been happy for 4 days.  I know that this isn't the end, that we are still going to have hurdles to overcome.  I honestly believe that this was a wakeup call for her, if not then why go through all of the emotional drama and turmoil.  Wouldn't she just let it go? Bottom line is I love her, I have always loved her and all I wanted was for her to show me she loved me as well.  This past weekend was a really bonding experience for me and for her as well.  I think we can build something new together. Thank you reddit, I felt the love from you guys as well.  I am ultimately a very lucky man. tl;dr;  Got caught with my reddit postings.  My sister and her sister convinced me to not go through with the letter. Her sister and her came over and she said things that she needed to say and let me say what I needed to say.  We spent 3 straight days together and it was heaven.  We are going to couples counseling.  I'm happy with the end result","Well, good luck.  But ""Sara"", if you are reading this, I have no respect for you as a person.  At all.  I'm also a survivor of the same crime you experienced.  I know everyone heals differently and no two are the same.  But come on.  You took advantage of this guy for over a year.  I don't care what kind of trauma you went through...nothing justifies having complete disregard for a devoted partner for *a year*.  And you cheated on him.... While simultaneously standing him up.  You should be so, so, so ashamed of yourself.  You don't EVER get to use your trauma as an excuse to actively hurt someone you love. EVER.   You decide how you will let this affect you from here on out.  You could have decided months ago to not let this take over your life, but you didn't.  You allowed yourself to be coddled for months on end.  You are a child at best.  How long were you planning on leading him on while you went out and ""took back your sexuality""?    The fact that you manipulatively asked OP if he was ""really going to leave you"" after everything you did to him, shows that you still are refusing to take responsibility.  If you had any respect for him or yourself, you would have womanned up and walked away as soon as you realized you needed to have sex with other people. I'm sorry...but you are pathetic if you keep using this incident as an excuse.  Please seek out a different therapist since the one you have been working with hasn't helped you move forward at all in the last year.  That is the definition of ""not working"".   How dare you continue to still do this to the person who loved you so much.  You don't deserve OP.  You already left him.  Let him go so he can find someone as loyal as he has been. **Edit:** What are you going to do if something traumatic happens to you if you have kids (since OP says he would have them with you in the future)? If something happens to  OP when your family isn't around to baby you?  Will you just curl up and die and neglect your kids? Of course as soon as someone tries to take them away,  all of your involuntary PTSD triggers preventing you from being a functional person will magically no longer be a thing.  Shame on you. You have no business being in an adult relationship until you learn to be an adult, not a little girl.  No one can break you unless you let them.   **Edit 2 (to her sister if you're reading this):** I believe Sarah's family and therapist were absolutely detrimental and irresponsible.  Since I never had the vindication of convicting my attacker, part of my healing was to become a certified volunteer rape advocate (the people who meet the victims at the hospital and support them through the rape kit, exam, preventative std treatment, police reports, and court appearances).    The FIRST thing they teach us in training is that if we encounter a victim who is hysterically  upset, we should never swoop in and coddle them.  Be warm and supportive, but it is vitally important that they pick themselves up off the ground.  Support, but don't be a crutch.   They have to find it in themselves to stand up and decide to move forward.  *That's* the first step to taking back control.  [PSA:  Same is true for victims of domestic abuse] It doesn't sound like she ever got this.  Her family immediately did this *for* her and put her in front of a therapist who didn't show any interest in helping Sarah develop the tools she needed to help herself.   Her sister and parents should be ashamed of themselves for enabling this for so long. That being said, she never knew how OP felt because she never fucking asked. Nor was he allowed to talk to her about it. She got too used to being the broken victim and not having to take any responsibility for herself.  After a year, it's pathetic and indicative of someone who doesn't want to get better.  Several months later she was still behaving like some girls (worst case scenarios) act in the first 24 hours.  In all the time I volunteered, I never saw someone that bad off even a week later.  100% fine?  No, usually not.  But they are able to fucking speak for themselves.  Sorry, but that's on her...not the rape.    TL;DR: OP...you've been had, son. ",3730
3eo2ic,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dcgt4/i30m_just_found_out_my_girlfriend28_of_a_year_had/ I spoke to her the day after. She told me she had wanted to tell me for a while, but didn't know where to start-- that she thought about Sam everyday but at the same time didn't know how to begin. She pulled out a shoe box from her closet and she showed me the pictures. Pictures of her wedding, this propped up little thing at the courthouse, her in a short white dress with a slight stomach. Her husband, this cocky smiled kid with this shaggy blond hair.  Then the baby, Sam. Pictures from a red-faced baby to this little four year old person. Birthdays, and Christmases, and pictures of the three of them- a family. She talked about Brendan. How they came from these radically different backgrounds and she barely knew him as a person before he was a father and husband. They'd only been dating three months when she got pregnant. They were twenty. Then she talked about Sam- her baby. She kept saying he was the best thing that ever happened to me. Hearing that broke my heart. She talked about how his hair cow licked in three different spots and how he was always singing or humming, that he loved to climb. She told me his favorite movie and book. She made him a person to me.  Then she told me how they lost him. Some kid ran a red light and then he was gone. She barely remembers the funeral because she was so heavily medicated. But the worst part was after, going home and him not being there- how she'd walk past his room and expect to hear him playing, waking up and forgetting for a minute he was gone.  Their marriage had never been good and they turned on each other. He blamed her because she had fastened the booster seat on that side of the car. She blamed him because he had been driving. They were divorced within a year after the accident. Brendan had a new child within two. She had spent the time doing overload on classes and working, keeping busy because it made things easier.She didn't see her old friends because they drifted away- they never knew what to say. And they mostly had kids of their own. She was surviving. But seeing Sam's brother who looked so much like Sam hurt so much that she decided she had to get away and stop wallowing. She took the pictures down, donated clothes and toys, deleted her fb and stopped seeing the old friends who weren't really friends anymore. She said she chose to keep breathing because that was what it had come down to. Then she met me.. and she said I made her want a fresh start- a better marriage and more children- because she loved me. We talked for hours, she cried and I cried for her.   I still love her maybe more now because I feel like she opened up to me so much. it's hard to imagine her married, with a son, toys on the floor, and pictures on the fridge. it's hard because in a lot of ways it's the life I've been imagining with her. I still plan on marrying this woman. She's the love of my life.  tl;dr She told me about her past. I love her and understand why she didn't tell me.   ",This must have been so hard for her.  I am glad you were there for her.  Good Luck.,2704
3evkhf,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cf4yn/my_31m_father_67m_is_now_on_his_deathbed_he/  So I went to see my dad and it basically went like shit. I caved, I fucking caved and decided fuck it, I'll see what he wants. Maybe this is something worth hearing. I visited the hospital by myself. Now wife. No mom. No sisters. Just him and I.   He looked old and tired and just as I predicted I didn't find it in me to be angry, this wasn't the man I remembered, this was just some old broken man. It would have been a waste of my time to feel angry and yet I did. I was so pissed off because I couldn't stand across from him eye to eye and let him see that the son he treated like dogshit had built a wonderful life for himself.    We didn't say anything to each other for around an hour. Then eventually I found my voice and said ''you know this is the last time we'll ever see each other right?'' No response. Then he replied ''I know.''  So I asked him why now? Why did he want to see me so badly that he had to send a message through my mother for me?   And here is where I learnt that my existence was fuck all to him. He admitted that he did it just to give my mom closure, she didn't ask him to do it but he knew she wanted it.   So I asked him why he treated me the way he did my whole life and he replied, **''I never wanted a son, never had any interest in one.''** It fucking hurt but I kept listening and he kept speaking. He said that in the first few years of my life he tried his best to care about me but eventually he realized he couldn't. Then came the final nail in the coffin of my relationship with that man.   **I never loved you but I didn't hate you either, I just didn't care for you because I never wanted a son, I wanted to give you up for adoption when you were younger but your mother would never have forgiven me, so I did my best to push you aside and you would always try and get my approval for stuff, I felt bad at times but I just didn't care for you**    By that time I was crying, me a 31 year old man, left my dying father in his hospital room and went to my car crying. I could have gone my whole life not knowing that. Fuck my mom, my sisters, my wife and my dad. I'm just so pissed right now.    There was a part of me that hoped we would bury the hatchet, nope, I just learnt he never gave a fuck.    I will never speak of my father again. I will not attend his funeral or visit his grave. When he dies I'll be at the bar drinking because the fucker is gone from this world and I will do everything I can to be the father he never was.   **TL;DR visited dying dad, found out he never wanted a son, wanted to put me up for adoption, didn't love me, didn't hate me, just never cared about me**   EDIT:-  **I just want to say thanks to everyone for your kind words, both in comments and pms, they really helped a lot, particularly while I was hung over this morning and laying in bed thinking about life. Also to the stranger who gave me gold, thank you, never had that before and it was quite unexpected.**  **I've got a ways to go still, I feel like yesterday opened up wounds I didn't even realized had never really healed and I'll be talking to my wife about it and most likely a professional as well. I won't cut my mom or sisters out, I am not angry at them, their experiences with my father were different from my own and I do not fault them for that, however, right now, the best thing for me, is just to not be around them as much. So I don't think they'll be seeing/hearing from me for some time.**  **Once again, I sincerely thank everybody, it was your comments and pms that made me realize, yeah it hurts like shit, but I can't let him have anymore power over me, I'm in the prime of my life and I've built a nice life for myself. I don't need a dying man's approval anymore because I've done the best I could for so long without it anyway, so here's hoping things will get better soon.**  ","Well, maybe it was some form of closure, although a really fucking shit one. Good riddance.  I don't get along with my father either. This whole story gives me anxieity.",1493
3fesvo,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ent6r/i_24m_had_a_threesome_with_my_girlfriend_24f_and/ I got a few requests for an update, so I thought I'd post one.  Pretty much what everyone suggested would happen, we broke up. It wasn't nice though. Honestly, I've been kind of regretting the threesome because more and more I feel like I was strongly manipulated; lead into believing it would be just no-strings fun whereas it was actually a vehicle for her to have sex with another guy. I sat her down and said to her clearly, I've been thinking about her proposition, and she can have sex with the guy if she tells me who it is, and she has to be honest about if she had this person in mind from the start when she suggested it. She became ecstatic to hear about this, and told me the person was ""Adam.""  I know ""Adam"", I've met him a few times, he works at the same place she does. ""I thought Adam is married"" I said ""He is, but he and his wife are swingers"" she tells me. I then tell her ""like I said, you are free to have sex with Adam as much as you want, but our relationship is over."" She then freaked out at what I said as she slowly realised I was serious and was ending the relationship out of the blue, she wasn't expecting it at all.  At first she thought I was kidding, then she became really angry at me and started shouting and going crazy.  She said all sorts of nasty things and told me I lied to her, deceived her, etc. because I had sex with another woman but won't let her have sex with another man. I told her she's free to have sex with him now, because our relationship is over, and I don't want to be in a relationship with a woman who very clearly lusts after another man. I then said to her something along these lines ""I feel like you manipulated me when you suggested the threesome; you said you just wanted to experiment but you were really trying to use it as leverage so you could have sex with another man.  If I had known that was your ulterior motive, I never would have agreed to it. What you did was dishonest and manipulative."" Of course, she wasn't too happy to hear this.  There was much tears and anguish from her part, but she accepted it eventually.  I started getting texts the next day from her, she was apologising profusely, saying she was sorry, she didn't want to sleep with another man, she regrets suggesting the threesome, and she just wants to continue her relationship with me. I said to her something about us being ""sexual incompatible"", but honestly I felt like I was just giving her a bullshit excuse. The real reason was that I didn't want a woman that so desperately wanted to have sex with another guy, that she would even manipulate me towards that goal. I keep getting more texts from her and missed calls, angry ones, apologetic ones, crying ones, and furious ones.  Since she didn't seem to get the message that we're through, I'm just ignoring her now.  Honestly, I'm really happy with my decision, no regrets. I feel like I've let go of some negative baggage, and I'm already excited about moving on with my life and pursuing future relationships.     **tl;dr**: We broke up.",You handled this perfectly. ,2740
3fmusk,"http://redd.it/3felxu Thanks everyone. You are very helpful. I called my grandparents on Saturday afternoon and told them everything. I had taken a few pictures from my sister that night and emailed them those pictures as well. They were pissed off and angry at him and my mom for not standing up for us. They told me to stay upstairs and don't apologise and they will come over on Sunday morning. So we did that. My mom came to talk to us again on Saturday evening, insisted that we can go apologise and we can all forget that it happened, but we kept refusing until she gave up. Later that night my mom came back up to talk to me again and wanted me to end this ""rebellion"" as she put it, saying that it won't lead to anything good and it just makes things worse. I told her that I'm just protecting sister. She said ""it's my job not yours"". I said ""clearly you're not doing it well enough so I'm gonna have to do it"". She gave up again.  So grandparents came over on Sunday morning. Mom and step father were home as well. We were upstairs and couldn't hear what they were saying but I could hear that my grandparents were very angry. I don't know what happened but after a while my mom came up and asked us to come down. We went down and Stap-father apologised to my sister and said it won't happen again and that he will make it up to us. My grandfather told me to let him know ASAP if something like this happened again. After they left my mom looked very angry at me but didn't say anything. P.S. I didn't call the police in the end. I was afraid to make the situation worse and make a much larger mess. I though involving grandparents is enough and they know better whether to call the police or not.     **tl;dr**: I called grandparnets. They came over and talked to them. Step father apologised after that and said it won't happen again.",Way to go. Good you took pictures. Do it again if something like this happened and let grandparnets know immediately. They seem like very nice people who care about you two.,2530
3fvooq,"Original post: https://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fp32i/i_27m_think_my_fiancee_27f_might_be_cheating/ First off, I wanted to thank everybody who commented on my original post. Most of you guys wanted me to call the number Sandra was constantly texting and I honestly was about to. She came home an hour after I had posted the original post. I was almost asleep by then and I guess she thought I was asleep. She took out her phone and unlocked it. I saw her password.  Eventually she fell asleep and I unlocked her phone and searched the number on her phone. The number belonged to some guy named Jeff and the text messages were extremely sexual. Some examples: From Jeff: I loved the way you bounce when we fuck. From Sandra: I love it when you go down on me. Those were just 2 examples of the sexts between them, but there was a hell of a lot more. I screenshotted a ton of them and sent them to myself.  At this point, I was done with her. I confirmed that she was cheating on me. So I decide to snoop some more and looked through her photos. They were a couple of photos of her kissing and cuddling with some guy, who I assume is the same guy she's been cheating on me with. Of course I also send those photos to myself. But what threw me over the edge was a video of her (I assume one of her friends were recording this) giving some guy head. I almost lost it and woke her up to confront her, but I calmed down. Of course, I also sent the video to myself.  At this point I went for a walk for nearly 2 hours. Mind you this is the middle of the night and the area I walked through isn't the safest of areas. Still, I didn't care. I was so angry. Eventually I calmed down enough and went back to our place. I slept for maybe 3 hours and woke up. I printed off some of the sexts and photos and waited for her to get up. She finally got up at about 6AM. When she finished eating breakfast I slammed the text messages on the table. She looked at me with horror. She started crying and shaking. I took the engagement ring from our dresser and walked out.  I came back a couple of hours later and she wasn't there. I called my landlord and told him we wouldn't be renewing our lease. I told her I was moving out and to never contact me again. I packed all my shit and moved in with a friend. So yeah that's it. She was cheating on me and I'm done with her. She's been blowing up my phone begging for a 2nd chance, but she's not getting one. **tl;dr**: Sandra is a cheating bitch. She can go fuck herself.","Silver lining of this is that you figured this out now, and not after you're married with couple kids with her.  Now, you can just try to focus on getting over her and moving on. You never have to have any contact with her again.  Good Luck ",2849
3fwuub,"So its been a few days and I thought I'd update my original post. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fkk4p/i24m_caught_my_sister26f_trying_to_steal_a_watch/ I invited my mom to lunch so that we could discuss what happened at the party and where to go from there. I explained to her that my sister stole a very expensive watch from me. It wasn't just some trinket, and it shouldn't matter even if it was. I tried to pull her away and confront her in private, but she chose to yell and curse at me and cause a scene. I also told her that I understand it is never okay to look into someones private purse or bag, but that sort of etiquette goes out the window when tens of thousands of dollars of my stolen property is in her purse.  My mom then went on a long rant about how we are all family and that her and my sister believe that a family should share in each other's success. She tole me that my sister was just upset because I was ""hoarding"" all of my money for myself and that it's understandable what she did. She said that I would never gotten where I am today without all the work she put into raising me and the influence her and my sister had on my life. Then she went on to tell me that I ""owe"" it to her to evenly share my success with her and my sister since we are family and they would certainly do the same in my position(that's a laugh)  At this point I'm pretty dumbfounded. Not only because she thinks my sister's actions were somehow justified, but because she credits herself for my success and thinks it's selfish of me not to share with her and my sister. And don't even get me started on her trying to act like her and my sister would do the same. I know for a fact my sister wouldn't give me a dime if I were 10 cents shorts for a heart transplant. And my mom still owes me tens of thousands of dollars that she borrowed and swore she would pay back(I don't expect it back and wrote it off as soon as I gave it to her)  I just can't even fathom how my mom could actually think like that. At that point I was so furious and didn't want to say anything I'd regret, so I got up and walked out. Oh yeah, I also got a text half an hour later saying that I owed her money for lunch since I was the one who invited her. Despite the fact that neither of us had even ordered before I left. As far as my sister goes, I haven't contacted her and she hasn't contacted me. At this point I'm just done with her in my life. I don't know if I should do the same for my mother though. I would hate to not have a relationship with her, but I just can't believe how she could possibly think those things. Would love some advice on what to do as far as my relationship with my mother goes. Thanks.       **tl;dr**:  Had lunch to talk with my mom about what happened. She claimed that my sister was justified in what she did because she was upset that I wasn't sharing my money with her. Told me that we are a family and should share in each other's success and that I am being selfish by not doing so.  I got up and walked out  END OF TLDR.  I thought that putting edit/update in front of the newly added parts would make it clear, but I keep letting angry complaints about how the TLDR is so long.     Edit: Small update I thought I'd post. She called me but I didn't want to talk so I let it go to voicemail. She left a voice mail telling me to check my email. Here is her email: ""First of all, it was very rude of you to walk out on me at the cafe. I was humiliated and you should know better than to treat your mother like that. As I said in the text, you owe me money for lunch since you were the one who invited me so please bring $60 to give to me at Craig's BBQ. It is a shame that I even need to be telling you this, I know I raised you better than that. But you really need to start supporting this family. We are all one, and the success of any individual needs to be spread around the family. Your sister works as a pastry chef and is always more than happy to bake for everyone and bring us treats from work, I wish you would do the same. You can start out by helping me with the new apartment I'm moving to. The rent is $4250 per month(not including utilities) I am planning on moving in around the first of September so that gives you plenty of time to set up some sort of monthly bank transfer. I'm going to need $8500 in about 2 weeks for the first and last months rent. I'll also need you to come over a few times this month to help move my stuff over there. Bring the bigger truck, unless that's the manual because Tod doesn't know how to drive stick. As a thanks for moving my things over there I will cover the security deposit myself so you don't even need to worry about it.  And you still haven't apologized to (sisters name) so please get that done this week. It will take 5 minutes tops so just get it done. It was wrong to humiliate her like that and guess you had to be the one comforting her. Me! Like usual.  Text me to confirm that you got everything and let me know how soon you can bring the big truck over. I should also mention that I currently pay for her rent. After some long guilt trip about how she gave me free food and housing for 18 years so it's time for me to repay the favor. I can clearly see now that that was a big mistake. Now she just assumes I'm going to pay her rent at some new huge place that costs twice as much and that she doesn't need? At this point I'm done giving her any support, she clearly as no appreciation for it.   That's just a taste of how my mom acts. She is extremely entitled and just expects everything in life to be given to her.     Edit: Another update. So I just sent my mom an email letting her know that I will not being giving her any more money.Here's the gist of it: ""I will not be paying the rent for the new more expensive apartment you want to move in. Not only will I not be paying for that, but I won't be paying your rent for any apartment anymore. You will have to do that yourself. In addition to that, I will not be giving you *any* money whatsoever. You have shown that you have no respect for me or the work it takes to earn money and I cannot continue to pay for things you don't need. I know this means cutting back a bit, but there is no reason for you to be living outside your means and I won't subsidize your expensive lifestyle."" I wrote it all out completely different, but that's the gist of what I told her. So just waiting for the freakout I'm sure is going to happen.","I was amazed that your mother reacted the way she initially did, and figured it was because she didn't know the whole story. After reading this update I'm dumbfounded and angry. Both of their greed will not go away any time soon I think, especially with your mother crediting herself with your hard earned success. You are probably better off without having either of them in your life. ",3303
3g5394,"[My first post is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ecgbv/i_30_f_am_sitting_in_the_back_of_my_rv_as_my/) The TLDR of the first post is that I bought an RV with my money so I could write/travel in it while husband is away for business. Husband insisted on taking the RV with him without me, I convinced him to let me come. Now he is ranting about how he doesn't want me on the trip while I sit in the back of the RV hating my life. I promised I would update, but things got very hectic and this is the first chance I have gotten. This whole situation makes me very emotional, so please forgive me if this post is not as coherent as I would like it to be. When I posted my first post, we were on the road in the RV and my husband was giving me the cold shoulder while he bitched at me from the driver's seat. You all had some great advice for me about what I should do, and I listened to a few people who suggested that he might be cheating on me. Tim had left his iPad in the back of the RV to charge while he drove. I'm not proud of this, but I was able to sneak his iPad into the bedroom while he was distracted by the road. He was logged into his email account and I quickly skimmed over his inbox but didn't find anything suspicious. I then had the idea to check his sent folder and found out that he had been chatting up his ex from college. It made me sick to my stomach to read the messages, but luckily they had not yet been physical. Translated from chatspeak, the message he had sent his ex was basically: ""I can't wait to get my hands on you! It's been years since I felt that mouth. I'm excited!""  I was disgusted, but I tried to keep calm. We were on the road headed to another state and we planned on stopping at his mother's house. I knew that if his messages were in the sent folder, that meant that he had deleted them. Tim was not planning on being caught and was trying to hide his tracks. He wanted my RV so that he could take his ex around the state and have fun without leaving a credit card trace. I took photos of the emails and sent them to myself in order to preserve the evidence. I then went back to the front of the RV and acted as if everything was fine. I apologized (don't worry, I lied) for how I had acted and suggested that we ask his mom to help us work through this. Tim said that he was sorry and that he accepted my apology. He said he was looking forward to using the RV in the future and that he was glad I had come to see reason. I smiled and nodded but on the inside I was cursing his existence. We made it to his mom's house and I made up an excuse about having to change because my clothes were wrinkled. Tim went inside without me and I started throwing all of his clothes and belongings into a trashbag. I then went inside the house and Tim was sitting with his mom in the kitchen. He asked me what I was doing with the bag and I told him that I was giving him his clothes so that I could leave. Tim then got angry and asked me what the fuck was I doing and his mom was simply confused. She asked me what was going on and I told her, ""I'm not sure myself. I'm waiting for Tim to explain why he was planning to cheat on me with his ex."" Tim's mom then started to cry and yell at Tim while he tried to calm her down. I know Reddit does not have a lot of love for religion, but Tim's mother is a fundamentalist. She had loved me from the minute Tim introduced me to her and it would be an understatement to say that she was very upset with her adulterous son. Tim never tried to apologize to me, instead he chased after his mother saying he was sorry to her. This made her cry harder, because she knew that he wasn't even trying to make amends with me, he was just apologizing to her. She hugged me and told me to just go home and she would handle her son. I thanked her and took the RV keys from Tim (this ended up being a minor wrestling match) and left. I drove home crying, but at least I got rid of my asshole ex-husband. Tim called me the next day and begged me to come back to him. He said it was all a mistake, that he was sorry. I asked him why he didn't apologize at his mother's house, why he didn't say he was sorry when I was handing him his bag. I told him that he didn't care about cheating on me, that all he cared about was how bad it made him look to his family. He tried to explain himself, but I cut him off and hung up. I blocked him on all social media and haven't heard anything since.  I have gotten a lawyer and have already started the divorce process.      **tl;dr**: Husband thought he could get away with cheating on me by using my RV. I found his emails, packed his bags, and left him at his mom's house. His mom took my side and has ripped into him since. I got a lawyer and have filed for divorce.","Wow, complex feelings on this one.  There's the ""Ouch, that's awful!"" but also an overwhelming ""BUT THANK GOD she's getting the fuck away from that asshole!"" I was concerned that you might stay with him for another year or two until the marriage gave its last gasp.  This is surely painful, but cleaner. And you haven't ever got to think about the other woman being in your(!) RV.",3646
3g6btr,"Update to my earlier posts here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fwuub/update_i24m_caught_my_sister26f_trying_to_steal_a/  After going through all the comments(thanks for the advice!) I decided to send my mother an email letting her know that I will absolutely not be paying for the new place she made plans to move to, and that I will stop paying her rent all together. I told her that she clearly does not respect me or the work I put in in order for me to be in a position to give her the money that I do. I also told her that I would not be financially supporting her in any way.  A few hours after I sent the email my phone starts blowing up. Calls over and over again. I still really didn't want to talk to her so I ignored them all. A little while later I get a call from my friend Dave, except when I answer the phone it's my mom. I found out later from Dave that she showed up at the bike shop he works at and made up some story about story about her locking her purse with her phone and keys in the car and needing to call me for a ride.  She immediately goes off on me about how ungrateful I am and that she is disgusted by the email I sent etc. She told me that it's my ""duty"" to make sure she is well cared for and comfortable, as she is the reason I'm here in the first place. The worst part was when she told me that if she knew I was going to end up this way that she wouldn't have put her life on hold for the last 2 decades in order to have me, and that I cost her her job and my dad and a bunch her her life plans. I couldn't even get a word in with all her yelling. The last thing she said was something along the lines of ""you need to have a come to jesus moment and realize how much you are hurting your mother. I have already packed up most of my stuff and have spent a ton of time setting this move up. I expect the $8500 before the weekend is over in a cashiers check so let me know when you have it."" and then she hung up.  I don't think I have even been so mad in my entire life. She pretty much just told me that I need to make up for everything she missed out on in order to have me by giving her money and making sure she's taken care of.  I called her back and she tried to start talking and I don't remember exactly what I said because I was so angry but I basically told her to shut the fuck up and let me talk(but with more swearing and yelling) I'm usually pretty calm and would never swear at my mom(I would never even swear near her) and I know I shouldn't have said that but I wasn't thinking straight. I told her she better find another place to live or pay her rent herself because she wasn't getting another dime from me. I turned my phone off after that because I didn't want to deal with anymore calls or texts. I eventually needed to use my phone so I turned it back on and just blocked her number. I saw that I had some calls/messages from her but I didn't want to look at them. This morning I got a call from the front desk at my building telling me that my mom had tried get up to my room, but I had already told the elevator staff/security to take her off my guest list. Apparently she caused quite the fuss when they wouldn't let her up.  She is blocked on my phone now so I haven't heard from her today yet, but I expect her to blow up on me again for what happened this morning.  I think she's probably in denial and thinks that I will cave and pay for her new place. I'm worried about what she's going to do when the deadline for her to pay for her new place comes up and I refuse to give her any money. The move in date is pretty soon and I'm sure she has to pay it pretty soon, I'm actually surprised she hasn't had to pay already. So that's going to cause a massive shitstorm. I'm really really worried about what she's going to do. Thanks again for all the advice!   TLDR:  Mom showed up at friends work and used his phone to call me because I wasn't answering her. Yells at me about not doing my duty and how I owe it her to take care of her because I basically ruined her life.  Says I have to give her rent check by the end of the weekend. Tell her she isn't getting a dime from me and hang up She tries to get in my building but isn't allowed.     **tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!","Way to go on standing your ground! $8500? Jesus, that's some entitlement there.",2435
3glzks,"Again thank you for all the support in the last two posts. You really helped me keep a clear head through all of this. I had no idea reddit could help me so much!  I didn't plan on posting again, but I have surprisingly good news.  OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3g747t/my_35m_girlfriend_21f_uncomfortable_with_my_wifes/ Update:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3gh3a2/update_my_35m_girlfriend_31f_uncomfortable_with/  Last night I came home from work to find a framed photo from my wedding hanging on the wall with the chain dangling around it. There was also a 5 page note from M on the coffee table.  I'm not going to type the whole note, because a lot of it was very personal to M. However I will say that there was a LOT of apologizing on her part. She told me that she thought a lot about the ring (and even did some googling) and realized that it's not all that uncommon. She said she was completely embarrassed by her reaction and that she was uncomfortable with the thought of being around ANYBODY'S remains. She called herself disrespectful, childish, and pathetic. :(  M also said that what I did was a beautiful thing, and shows what a sensitive and loving man I am. That she want's to be with me more than anything and doesn't want to change a thing about our tradition (taking the ring traveling). She told me she nows see's that it's a lovely idea and said my wife was lucky to have me and my family. That she as well is lucky to now be a part of my and my family's life.  She concluded saying that she felt as though we had a good connection and handled conflict well. She said she hopes that I know her well enough to know that this isn't the way she typically reacts (I do). She also told me she was going to get therapy, as she is worried about what will happen once somebody she knows dies.  The last part of her note said that she left a surprise in my fridge (a 6 pack of my favorite beer) and that she'd love to enjoy them with me if I'll have her. She told me to take all the time I need before calling her and that she hopes someday I'll forgive her for her actions.  I called her immediately. We talked, and she pretty much repeated what she said in her note. I repeated what I said at dinner (that she is my number one, and that I am so sorry for lying about the ring). We have plans to see each other tomorrow night.  I love the photo of me and my wife. I don't have many photos of us, and none that are framed. The chain looks perfect around it, and it's a nice little memorial to have in my home. I love the idea of starting a new home with M, while still having my wife's memory be a part of it.  I know this is not what many of you wanted to read. You wanted me to kick M to the curb. However, I think that a year of good actions make up for one bad action. Her apology was genuine and I really do feel as though this won't happen again. If she tries to control something like this again, and I can't resolve it, I guess I know where to post ;)  I can't thank you all enough.   Edit: I was expecting you all to be disappointed in me, and yet the first comments are saying how happy you are for me. Thanks again reddit!  **tl;dr**: M made big apology. Forgave her. Happy. ",This is what a lot of us wanted to read and it shows that she can learn from her mistakes.  I wish both of you the best! ,2230
3gurep,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3gqhpq/my_26m_girlfriend_24f_openly_does_not_agree_with/) Thank you all for the comments. I was pretty surprised by the volume. I was trying to downplay my concerns about the incidents at my parents’. I met up with Rachel at her place before maybe heading for dinner together. I let her know that I wanted to talk about what she said about my mom during vacation.  (I’m just going to provide a dialogue about what was exchanged to make it easier for me and hopefully less confusing.) Me:  I’m still trying to understand why you said what you said at dinner and why you are in such disagreement with my mom. Rachel: It’s so weird how good looking your dad is still. He could have been a model when he was younger. Your mom is not anywhere in the same league as your dad.  Me: I don’t understand what you’re talking about. Rachel: I think it’s odd that they are together. It’s creepy. Me: My parents love each other. I don’t get the problem you have. I think that you purposefully brought up having kids earlier than my mom to criticize her. Rachel: Well I don’t like your mom. I don’t have to like her. The rest of conversation was more pulling teeth.  I had already given thought about what happened last weekend and I guess I share a chapter or two from my parents’ book, I want to feel confident about my partner. Rachel gives me doubt, not comfort.  A lot of comments mentioned that I may have been oblivious and what I initially perceived as frankness was likely always tactlessness, that I may have not noticed it was tactlessness because I was in agreement.  I think these were factors, but I also didn’t agree with Rachel always on her opinions, I just didn’t disagree either. I broke up with Rachel last night. Her parting words were “A mama’s boy is just plain ugly. And you’re cursed with your mom’s looks!” **Edit**: So I rang my parents to let them know that I broke up with Rachel. I spoke with my dad first and he said, “You made a good decision. She was dumber than a box of hair.” Then I spoke with my mom and she asked why I ended it. I told her that she was too irrational and contradictory. She wasn’t convinced that was the entire reason so I told her everything since she has a pretty thick skin. She had a real good laugh and said that Rachel’s just a mean girl and she’s glad that it didn’t take me longer than 8 months to work that one out. And she also told my dad that he's still got it.  **TL;DR**: Broke up with Rachel. She was tactless to the end. ","> It’s so weird how good looking your dad is still. He could have been a model when he was younger. Your mom is not anywhere in the same league as your dad. Dear girlfriends of the world, never call your boyfriend's momma ugly. What the actual fuck. You dodged a bullet OP.",4121
3gz677,"OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3guzht/my_girlfriend_is_turning_21_and_wants_me_21m_to/ I logged into facebook at like 2 AM last night and my girlfriend has posted a message on the party event wall saying the party was cancelled.  She saw the no-shows before I could let her know about it.   I called her and suggested some other activities we could do, things like amusement parks or concerts or taking a cooking class.  I thought she'd like all those ideas. ""No thank you."" We were kinda quiet over the phone, until she asked me in a really small voice if I could come over. We met outside her dorm at like 3 in the morning.  She was crying, as I expected.  But it was just watery eyes, not full on sobs how she usually cries. ""It's okay,"" she said.  ""Some people aren't meant to have friends."" I told her she was exaggerating, that she just needs to look in different places, etc.  She shook her head.  ""No, I'm done."" This morning at breakfast we passed a lot of mutual acquaintances.  Usually my girlfriend smiles and says hello.  Today she just kept her eyes on the pavement, not looking at anyone.  She barely ate.  But other than that she seemed like her normal self with me, talking and laughing.  She just wouldn't look at anyone else. She told me how she's going to use this extra time to get better in her classes, to work on her jewelry and maybe open an etsy shop.  To read more books. I asked her if this is really what she wanted. ""No, but life doesn't always give you what you want.  I didn't want to be an engineer.  I didn't want to live in a basement alone.  I didn't want to hate college and wish every day that I could drop out.  But you make the best of it."" Her voice was breaking as she said this, but she didn't cry.  She left the breakfast table after that and said she wanted to be alone. Where the hell do I go from here?  Her actual birthday is tomorrow (we were throwing the party a week later) and she insists she doesn't want to do anything.  Is it bad that part of me sort of agreed with her, that some people aren't meant to make friends?  I don't think I am, but obviously she wants friends and it's making her miserable. **tl;dr**: Girlfriend canceled party, said she didn't want to do anything for her birthday, and announced that she's given up on finding friends.  She isn't going back to any of her clubs or activities, and is going to focus on her studies and hobbies this coming year.  Her actual 21st birthday is tomorrow.  Where do I go from here? **EDIT:  I am sitting with her in her dorm room right now.  She's on the bed reading, I'm on the couch minding my own business, just being near her.  She is okay.**","If she normally reacts/acts out more dramatically and all of a sudden she's this kind of calm, accepting sad, I would stick to her like white on rice. At the end of the day no one knows her better than herself and likely you, but this sounds very familiar to experiences i've had, and if it's similar then calm sad=profoundly sad. So sad you can't even work up the energy to really be upset or cry. Be there for her. Do something nice for her, plan activities that she would like, think if she's casually mentioned anything she might like. Anything that will make her feel like she is less alone. It's OK for some people to not have friends outside one's SO and family, but it can be very emotionally stressful at times. ",2389
3h37bz,"I'm sorry if this is jumbled, I'm on my phone and in total shock right now. I'm an only child that was bought up by my mum alone (my dad left before I was born). I love (well, loved) my mum to bits, she's done so much for me and sacrificed everything so I could have a good education and a happy life. I met my boyfriend when we were in university. We're both each other's first everything - first kiss, first sexual experience, first relationship. I love (again; well, loved) him with all my heart. I truly believed we would be together forever. We moved in together two years ago and our relationship has been practically perfect since then. We never fight, and he makes me feel like a princess everytime I'm with him. This morning he woke up and went to have a shower. He left his phone on the bedside table, and when it vibrated I simply picked it up to check what the notifcation was for (I wasn't snooping, it was just habit to check it out when the sound went off). I honestly did not believe what I was reading. It was a text from MY mum saying something along the lines of: ""I hope your morning wood is as good as your afternoon wood ;)."" Obviously I freaked out and went into his phone (I know his pin code). They had been basically sexting for around a fortnight. Pics, stories of what they'd ""do to each other"", and worst of all reflection on an afternoon they spent together. I honestly can't remember what the texts specifically said, once I read them I locked his phone and bolted downstairs into our other bathroom. I pretty much just sat in the shower and sobbed until he left for work. Once he did, I threw on some clothes, grabbed my phone, purse, etc, and drove to a quiet nearby park - which is where I am now bawling my eyes out. I have no idea what to do. These were the two most important people in my life. I have pretty much no friends here. All of my extended family live overseas. I'm so heartbroken. Please help me. tl;dr - found texts that suggested my bf had sex with my own mum, i dont know what to do now ","You're in horrible shock, and rightly so. The two people in the world that were supposed to love and protect you didn't. They betrayed you in the worst possible way.   You said in a reply to someone in this thread that you don't think you can survive without them.  YES YOU CAN. Get mad, get angry, get _furious_. And then get moving. Can you afford to live in your flat without your bf? If so, pack up all his stuff and kick him out. If not, find somewhere else to live, with a friend, a classmate, a cousin, whatever. Cut him out of your life entirely. Block his number, don't answer the door, delete his emails. There is NOTHING he can say that would make fucking your mom acceptable. Don't let him try to rationalize it or make excuses. Don't let him manipulate you into staying with him. He's a loser, a liar and a cheat.  Maybe, _maybe_ you can decide to go forth with a relationship with your mom, although it will be drastically different of course. I suggest taking some time to get a clear head before you even think about interacting with her.  I would ignore her calls and texts for however long it takes you to feel ready to deal with her, whether that be days, weeks or months. This will be the hardest part because she's your mom and you love her. But you need to take time to really think about what's happened and get right in your own head. Maybe you can decide to talk to her again, maybe not. Whatever you decide is right for you.  Most of all, take care of yourself. I am so sorry this has happened to you.  I wish you strength to get through this.",2158
3hw1jh,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dheie/my_26_f_with_my_husband_29_m_1_year_he_has_been/) Summary of Original Post- My husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. After failure of chemo and other treatments, he was told he has about a month to live. I asked for advice on how to make this time count and all of you wonderful people gave some very good advice.  Let me begin by saying that as much as I was day dreaming that I'll get to update everyone of a miraculous recovery my brave darling made, I had to wake up to the bitter reality. My husband passed away a few days ago. And just as a lot of you had warned me, with all the preparation in the world and a warning that not many are fortunate to receive, absolutely nothing about when it actually happened felt like I was at all ready. It may as easily have been sudden. He fought bravely to the end and I'm proud of his attitude. I'm happy he doesn't have to suffer and put on a brave face for me anymore. I'm here to thank all of you. Despite what I said above about not feeling prepared, I do feel blessed for having got that time. We may not have completely finished ""the list"" but we sure got to do some of the things that the busy preoccupations of life in all its cruelty snatches from a lot of people. We may not be completely without regrets but we managed to make our list of 'I wish I had's a lot shorter than it would have been before the warning. So here I am to thank everyone who commented/replied/PMed on that post. It meant a lot to both of us. A sincere thanks to all of you. A special shout to a few people: u/mistyranch for courage and sharing  u/mcdie88 for making me feel like a 100 years old (covered that milestone too as he insisted I will live his share too!) u/tacofugitive for looking out for me u/aaoun responsible for some high quality home made porn u/dahlialia who irritated the hell out of my husband as I wanted answers to ALL the questions u/emalen thanks to whom I thought about this part, the coping u/whatsleftisrigh for instilling some pragmatism in me u/ianoftawa thanks to whom unfinished business won't be an issue u/brandyelf who made X'mas come early this year u/tenebrous1 who inspired a letter that I haven't been able to read past two lines of u/emlgsh whose words rung in my ears to keep me stronger on the bad days u/throwyourtoothbrush without whose advice I would have tried to do it all on my own and made a mess for sure u/tomyownrhythm who sure knows how to turn a good spin on the dark moments u/daivyjones for the immense support u/WeltallPrime for inspiring my very first novel and so many others for all the wonderful advice, support and most importantly for sharing your stories, I can't thank you enough. I'm sorry I can't mention all of you here. Please know how much every word meant to me. Here's an update of all the things we did end up doing (and I hope this will help someone else like us out there): 1. As suggested by a lot of you, pictures and videos. I have loads of data of him doing his daily chores to just snoring away next to me. And I still don't think it's enough. Do this, you may not have a warning, you may regret it if you don't. A little background of me here, I've always been anti pictures, I would proudly say make memories not photo albums and that if something is important enough, you'll remember it. While I still stand by that to a certain extent, I do condone finding that balance. I would charge my tab, turn on the camera and put it in our room. So I could enjoy him and then re enjoy our moments later. And we made the heavily suggested naughty videos as well. Fair warning, getting closure is important so don't get drowned in these memories either. It's too soon for me but I do understand the risks and will look out for myself. 2. Which brings me to my next point. Discussing the future. As much as one would want to avoid thinking about a life beyond the one they love the most, not thinking of it will make it that much harder when it inevitably comes. Here's where all the advice on being practical was executed. Practicality on financial and emotional fronts; financial being having ALL the financial information including account numbers, passwords, life insurance policy details, wills and any debts and the latter being arranging for a therapist and talking about expectations from a partner after one is gone and discussing the kids futures, if any. He documented all the financial information and verified it twice, taught me how to access his bank's site and wrote down a step by step guide on how to get the insurance money once he was gone. He wrote a letter addressed to my ""next spouse"" with all the not so easy to discover things about me that were wonderful and necessary, in his words.  3. I wrote a book about him. I'm an aspiring author and I'm proud to say that the love of my life is the sole reader of my only book. 4. Scrapbook. This was so fun! I collected screenshots of the best and meanest things we've ever said to each other, printed those, interspersed those with our pictures over the years in chronological order (starting with the cliched obligatory baby pictures), threw in a few lists I wrote out of top 9 dates, top 9 best sex, top 9 reasons I love him (both our birthdays fall on 9th) etc., mixed in a crossword puzzle he had to solve and our scrapbook was ready! 5. I named a star after him. I know this is slightly silly but now I can look at him whenever I want. 6. Needless to say, indefinite time off work, spent every waking moment in his arms and sleeping moment in his tightly wrapped arms. Yes, lots of cuddling and just being together. 7. Balcony picnic. This was an excellent idea. Stars, candlelight, good food and some good old fashioned open air sex 8. Speaking of which, lots of sex.  9. We discussed with his doctors and freezing his sperm was not a possibility at this stage so that couldn't pan out.  10. The last life party. I wanted to call it The party that never ends but he played the cancer card so I was shot down. All his friends and family came over, everyone said a few things about and to him, nobody was allowed to cry, I told them I was spending a lot on the funeral and he was stealing my thunder by being a tear hogger. It was actually pretty nice with gag jokes from his goofy friends, something like a Halloween with a ghost attending but he's friendly like Casper rather than being creepy/scary 11. Told him I loved him, constantly. And anything else that came to my mind that I wanted him to know! He was quite a sport about it and returned the favor. 12. We played cards together, watched football matches and his favorite shows together. Things he loves. Casually holding each other. 13. Festival week- a day designated to all the festivals. Milestone birthdays- video recording for each with a message  14. Cooked his favorite meals for him. He was my happy helper. He'd wash the tomatoes and I'd make the lasagna. He called me the food conjurer. 15. Made him wear his favorite shirts for several days so now they'll smell like him for some time. 16. Knit him a sweater, made a portrait of his 17. Things very specific to him that he wanted to do- a small bucket list that I won't bore you with     I feel like I've lived a lifetime in the last month. The quote about living each day like your last got realized. I made a lot of memories I'll never forget.  I want to say one more thing before I sign off. All those who have been patient enough to make it to this part of the post or impatient enough to skip to this part, thanks for reading. I have read a lot of things on this sub and unfortunately a majority of the things I read are escapist, overcautious and pessimistic. While I encourage the right of one to protect themselves from potential hurt, I do find the world hiding behind that right shying away from happiness and condemning others at the drop of a hat. Not meaning to sound preachy or claiming to know anyone's personal situation, I do wish to say this..believe in people, believe in goodness, believe in second chances. My husband and I didn't have it perfect, we had our rough patches and forgave each other for mistakes if the other truly showed repentance for them. I could have left him long back and I would have been in the same scenario I am today, leading a life without him. The difference is I would have chosen that in the former scenario whereas now I have to accept the situation. And being here I know I would give anything in the world for that choice right now, I'm so glad I was wise enough to look past his tiny flaws and  fill my life with moments of the absolutely wonderful loving man he is (was). Be vulnerable, take risks, get hurt, it's part of being a human and it's ok. As long as you're not being downright stupid, harming yourself or those around you irreparably and not being codependent enabling someone's flaws rather than accepting them, it's ok to make mistakes, that's how we learn and grow. And on the chance that it's not a mistake, the potential upside is limitless. In the comments of my original post, a lot of you wrote that you cried and told your SO you loved them or gave them a random hug much to their surprise. I'll admit that those comments made me happier than anything else. That our story could inspire some bond somewhere to get stronger was the greatest compliment. So I request anyone reading this to do this today. Give your SO that surprise hug, tell them you love them. I wouldn't wish what we went through on my worst enemy and I'm still glad I got that time. But most of you won't. THIS time is that time for you. I'm sorry that for most of you, it will be sudden/painful and prolonged. Living your life like each day is your last is impractical. But living your relationship like each day is your last is the easiest and most comforting thing in the world. Hug them, hold them, tell them you love them... Cheers to all the love in the world. Thank you all once again.  **tl;dr**: My husband passed away, this update is to thank all of you for your wonderful advice and support Edit 1 : Thank you once again Reddit, for all the overwhelming response. Thanks for all the tears, all the hugs and all the support. Thanks for the PMs offering more support. And above all, thanks for our story helped make a difference in your life. I'm so grateful to each of you who's vowed to work on their relationships and love their partners more. I'm trying to reply to each one of you kindhearted folks, apologies if I have missed out on anyone. Thank you for being with me in this time. Your thoughts, prayers and support means a lot to me.

3ie7m5,"[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3i958y/my_26f_fiances_28m_exwife_28f_has_cancer_hes/) First off, thank you all so much for your advice and words of support. I’m sorry that I couldn’t reply to every comment, reply, or PM that I got, but I woke up to a locked post and over 100 unread messages. I promise, I did read through every one of them. Each perspective was incredibly helpful and made me look at the situation in a completely different way. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.  I spoke to Max this morning. I told him that as terrible as I feel for Caroline, I don’t want him living over there until February. I suggested that we brainstorm some sort of schedule that allowed him to continue visiting her, even postponing our honeymoon and using that money to fund his plane tickets. Several commenters brought up her moving over here for treatment, so I mentioned that as well, offering up our spare bedroom. I emphasised that I didn’t fault him for wanting to help an old loved one in what could be her final days, but that I couldn’t help but feel marginalised, especially so close to our wedding.  Max didn’t speak very much, just listened while I rambled on. When I couldn’t think of anything else to add, I asked him to please say something.  So he told me the truth: Caroline was never stage 4. She was stage 2.  He assured me that the rest of his story is true. Caroline asking him to be with her, the initial surgery being unsuccessful, her chemo treatment plan, etc. But apparently her chances of survival are *far* greater than he led me to believe.  Max said he lied because he felt it was the only way I could understand his need to be with her. He thought that if her situation seemed less dire than literal life-or-death, I wouldn’t agree to him essentially moving across the country for her.  He admitted to telling her that our wedding had been postponed to next August, giving her the impression that him being away until February would be no problem. He has also been the one insisting on remaining by her side. After her surgery, she had given him permission to return home, saying that it wouldn’t be fair to pressure him into living with her throughout her entire chemo treatment, as much as she would have liked him there. He refused to leave. He told her that I supported this decision fully.  Max swears that he’s not in love with her still, but I just can’t believe that. He lied to my face. Before she visited our apartment back in May, he warned me not to mention her being stage 4 as she was still “extremely sensitive about it.”  And I completely bought into that lie. I trusted him.  He put his past with her over his future with me. I’ll be spending the next few months apartment hunting and cancelling wedding plans.  Thank you all for your kind words.  **tl;dr: Confronted fiance. He misrepresented his ex-wife’s illness so that he could spend time with her. It’s over.** *Edit:* I'm blown away by the outpouring of support I'm receiving. I wish I could respond to each of you individually. Thank you so, so much. This is a wonderful community, and I truly appreciate all of your thoughts. ","Oh my God, i am so sorry. What a turd. You on the other hand, handled this beautifully. Please lean on the people close to you in this time.  Or lean on us! I know you don't think it right now, but you're going to be ok.  Many internet hugs being sent your way. ",3670
3iqkkc,"Hello Reddit! I'm normally a lurker and can't think of a better name for this account right now. I met my husband 6 years ago when we both had just graduated college. He was a lovely guy, handsome and very well put together. He loved muscle cars and weight lifting and I loved everything about him. I fell in love with him instantly and was over the moon when he asked me to marry him. A year into our marriage, I became pregnant with our son and gained about 30 lbs. I was 5'3"" 125 lbs before the baby and 155 lbs after the baby. I still fit into the same clothing sizes so I didn't think I had gained too much weight and that it would come off with breastfeeding and some more exercise.  After the baby, my husband started pressuring me to lose the weight. He said that his friends were making comments about how fat I had gotten and that he was not as attracted to me as he was before I had the baby. He gave me an ultimatum that I either would have to lose the 30 lbs in six months or he would leave me. I was very upset about the demand, but I didn't want to lose him so I tried my hardest to lose the weight. Every day for months I would wake up and go to hot yoga for 90 minutes. After I got home from work, I would run or do some bodyweight exercises. I tried to keep my calorie count below 1200 so that I would lose 2 or more lbs per week. The weight slowly but surely started to come off and I was back down to 130 lbs by the end of the six months. My husband was happy and things looked like they would be okay. After I lost the weight, I noticed a shift in the attitude of my husband's friends. Most of them are perfectly nice guys, but a few of them are absolute pieces of shit (the same ones who called me fat). Once I returned to my old weight, these friends started to make comments about me and how sexy I was. I told my husband to make them stop and he said that he would speak with them, but the rude comments never stopped. I channeled all of my frustrations into working out and I lost an additional 15 lbs of body fat and got more toned. This past weekend, my husband's friends were over at the house and one of them grabbed me and tried to grope me. I told my husband and even though he was angry at his friend, he was still angry at me. My husband said that I was leading his friends on by losing so much weight and that I was trying to make myself skinny so that I could cheat on him. I was disgusted by this accusation and packed my bags and left for my mom's house. Last night, my husband called me and begged for me to come back home. He says that he knows that he was unfair and that he won't let his friend come over anymore, but I am so tired of dealing with this that I'm not sure I want him back. He's the one that told me to lose weight, but now he's blaming me for being too skinny and I'm afraid he's going to make me develop an eating disorder. But I also still love my husband and it hurts me to be apart from him. I'm so confused and I'm not sure what to do.     **tl;dr**: Had a baby and gained weight, husband told me to either lose the weight or leave. I lose the weight and then some and husband's friends started hitting on me. Husband blamed me for it and I left him. He called me yesterday asking for a second chance and I don't know if I should give him one.",Your husbands love and respect fluctuates with your weight. Think about that. ,4455
3iu4q5,"A (single) friend called me a couple of days ago asking me if I knew that Dave (bf) was using Tinder, despite being with me for the last 3 years, and living together and happily planning an engagement. I was distraught, knowing what tinder is and what it is used for, I was heartbroken.  She goes on to tell me that his Bio says he's ""Looking to make some new, exciting and fun friends and looking to hangout. Willing to travel a little if there's enough excitement involved!"" His pictures do not include me, despite 9/10 pictures ever taken of either of us for the last three years having the two of us together in them. One of his pictures is him at the beach, shirtless and a tiny man thong I got him as a joke. He cropped me out of the image. I brought this up to him, and he laughed it off, saying that 1: my best friend of 11 years is a 'nosy bitch' and that 2: he's entitled to seek friends and be social, even if it is with complete strangers. Basically he completely invalidated my points and made *me* feel guilty for being upset by this, playing it off like I am being possessive.  Since then I've avoided bringing it up and just tried to get over it. He hasn't been out and about any more than usual so it doesn't look like he has any 'takers' yet, but this is just *not* sitting right with me. I'm upset and feeling betrayed, and I don't know how to put my point across without him invalidating it or guilting me. What can I do? Am I in the wrong for not being OK with this? I do not want to throw away three years over something that might be ME being silly. **TL;DR: Boyfriend of 3yrs using a notorious dating and casual sex/hookup app to ""look for friends"" with suspicious bio and pics.** Edit: Firstly, thank all of you for all of your perspectives and advice in this quite frankly disgusting situation I've found myself in. I decided I'd play dirty as someone suggested and made a tinder profile, pretending to be a friend (with her permission!) whom he does not know. I hit on him. He reciprocated and made plans to meet with 'me' at a nearby coffee shop that we occasionally date at, minutes after making 'my' intentions clear. Wow. In about 20 minutes he'll be headed out to go and meet 'me' and I'll be packing up his shit ready for him to leave when he gets back. House is my families, he has no rights to any of it. I deserve better. Edit/Update 2: He sat at the coffee place waiting for 'her/me' for over an hour in the hopes to meet my, to be honest, gorgeous friend. Obviously she didn't show up. Shortly after he left I called my dad to explain, and I must have sounded pretty distraught because he came over without me asking. Dave came home to his clothes packed up by the door. He came in yelling ""what the fuck is this?"" and, unbeknownst to him, my dad was sat by me on the sofa and responded on my behalf, telling him in no certain words to get his filthy unfaithful ass out of his house. I am glad he did. I think my dad knows I'm timid and prone to being pushed about. His face dropped when he pieced it together and without a word he 180'd and grabbed his bags. I know he has places he can stay, and family nearby, so I'm not worried about him having no place to sleep.  This is going to hurt for a long time, but I can never forgive that kind of breach of trust. I'm not the type of person to move past it. I'll allow him back to collect his pieces of furniture and such in a week or so when he is situated, but that's as far as seeing him again goes. I am also dreading a phone call from his mother, whom I love dearly. She'll be heartbroken too.  Welp, bye bye three years. Fuck you Dave! :')","Is he allowed to seek friends and be social? Sure. But ""why are you using a notorious dating/casual sex/hookup app to make new friends"" is a TOTALLY VALID question. Even if, for some strange reason, he is genuinely only looking to make friends on Tinder, his profile is incredibly misleading to other people on Tinder, which means that he's going to hurt a lot of innocent people's feelings and cause a lot of awkward conversations if he's not upfront and honest. Me personally, I would say that he can keep the Tinder account if: 1) He changes his profile to include the fact that he has a fiance. 2) At least one of his pictures includes said fiance. 3) If he does decide to communicate with anybody from the site, he tells said fiance. But TBH he will probably refuse to do those three things, which is pretty suspicious.",1167
3jn7eb,"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3j9ol0/me_36m_with_my_42f_of_2_years_i_suspect_shes_up/) First off, I want to say thanks to the advice everyone had given.  There were a few thoughts that resonated that I appreciate.  Secondly, get your popcorn.  *Disgunbgood.jpg.gif*  I know we all like a good story, and this is somewhat therapeutic for me.  This all happened a few days ago and it took me a bit to digest everything.  Quite a bit of advice was around direct confrontation and asking her what the heck was going on.  After numerous ignored phone calls and text messages she finally decided to pick up her phone.  She apologized and said her phone died and she didn't realize it until it was too late.  I started in right away with that she had previously sent me a message non nonchalantly that she just 'wasn't feeling it' between us.  After that message, we talked and she said she was just feeling stressed and was taking it out on me.  Understandable...stress happens.  So my next question was this: ""Your friend had told me that you were seeing someone else.  Whats going on?  Do you want to break up??""  Her answer?  ""What??? WHO SAID THAT??? oh my god.... who said that?? Oh my gosh, Im sooooo tired of all these rumors about me!   Who said that?!""    She went on like this for quite a while.  What struck me was that she was more concerned about someone ratting her out than the accusations.   She assured me over and over that no she did not want to break up and then started making me feel awful that I would make these statements towards her.  Didn't I know how she felt about me?  That i was saying this made her feel like I didn't trust her.  I suddenly felt like the worst person in the world. She also pleaded with me to give up who it was that said this, but I wasn't budging on that.  In the end, she said she was having an emotional, stressful day and just wanted to relax and we would talk later, maybe over the weekend.  After taken in the advice from here... I felt like she was misdirecting.  I sat there in a mix of feeling like something was amiss, and feeling awful that i just accused my beautiful girlfriend of cheating on me.  I felt terrible.  I sat for a bit, feeling like I just put this huge crack in our relationship.  I love her to pieces.  I needed to go apologize.   I hopped in my car and drove the hour to her city and decided to get her a quart of her favorite chocolate ice cream on my way there.  When I stopped into the shop to pick up this treat, I run right smack into her daughter hanging out with her boyfriend.  They are both in college, doing night classes and just got out of school and wanted a treat.   We were chit chatting and she was going to be staying at her bf for the night, but forgot one of her workbooks and needed to stop at the house real quick to pick it up. After chatting, the daughters bf took off and we both drove up to my GF house.  I pulled into the street because they have assigned parking at her unit.  Her daughter actually pulled up behind me instead of her own spot and when we got out I said, ""whats up, neighbor took your spot again?"" as we walked up to the door.  ""No.... thats not my neighbors car...""  I don't know if it was the way she said it or her sigh afterwards or what but suddenly it felt like my heart just sank.  I KNEW what we were going to find, but I was hoping for anything but that.  Her daughter and I both shuffled through the door and stopped immediately in the entryway.  We could just hear them.  There's no mistaking it.  You know the sound:  rhythmic thumping and moaning with little exclamations of pleasure.  The bedroom was right across from us.   Her daughter looked at me with her eyes as big as saucers and just goes 'oh my god....im sooooooo sorry'.   At this moment it felt like i was living outside my body. Its hard to explain but suddenly it was like i was just a person watching actions happen. I couldn't really feel anything and  I didn't know what to do.  Here i am...standing here...with a quart of ice cream while my GF is getting railed in her bedroom.  I had no idea how to proceed. My whole body just felt like i couldn't control it.  Her daughter suddenly just screams 'MOM! WHAT THE FUCK!' that sounded like a cross between a banshee wail and an firetruck siren.   My GF actually ran out of the bedroom, naked and all, possibly thinking there was some emergency.  Maybe motherly instincts that something bad just happened.  I don't know.  She started to formulate words but fell silent as soon as she saw the too of us standing there.  Eventually a stream of words fell out of her mouth: ""oh my god. What are you doing here?  You're not supposed to be here.  what are you doing here?""  She kept repeating it over and over until she ran back into the bedroom.   I still stood there. shocked.  Still having an out of body experience. I don't know how much time passed. seconds or hours.  It blurs.   She came out clothed in her pajamas and was talking to whoever it was on the other side of the bedroom door.  My GF (EX now) started yelling at her daughter and I about why we were in the house.  I think the realization of everything was suddenly starting to hit her because she started crying and making unintelligible noises.  Her daughter starts to scream at her about 'how could you do this??' and 'you did it AGAIN?'    At this point...I had seen enough.  I couldn't even look at her anymore. Everything was numb and my ears felt like they were ringing. My body still wasn't my own.   I walked over to her kitchen table and put down the ice cream saying, 'I know you get hungry after sex....so heres some ice cream.'  and walked out the door.   She started sobbing 'Nooo' but it I just kept walking and drove home.   That was a few days ago.  I didn't go to work the next day.   My phone has been BLOWN up. I have not replied.   For your reading pleasure here are some of my favorite messages: ""If we had spent more time together it wouldn't have happened."" ""It doesn't mean anything.  You know that I love you"" ""If you cared anything about us or our relationship you would talk to me."" ""Are you ignoring me?"" ""Please"" I have lots of 'please's.   ""if you cared, we would be able to work this out""  It goes on and on.   Right now I still feel kinda numb.  I just don't understand how or why this happened.  I gave this girl and her family so much and my all and it didn't even matter.  I provided for them when times were tough and did so much to make our lives good.  I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I feel like I don't mean anything or that I can't make someone happy now. It's frustrating.  I know Ill get over it in time but it definitely hurts. I don't understand why or how this could happen. We were soooo good too.  So many questions I want to ask her, but Im forcing myself to NOT have contact with her and just going to move on.  In retrospect I wish I kept the ice cream.  **tl;dr**: GF caught having sex.  She got rewarded with Ice cream. ","Ugh...I hate the ""If you cared about our relationship"" bullshit. If she cared about your relationship she wouldn't have fallen on some other guy's dick. ",2782
3k5o1s,"Hi Reddit. I apologize for a wall of text, but I feel like I need to write everything out to vent my frustrations. So, here we go! So last Saturday, my boyfriend whom I've been dating for 5 years had a threesome.. We're very protective of each other, and we've had our fair shares of having someone chasing us or trying to get at us, but we've always remained committed. We always tell each other everything, and yes, we do get jealous a lot. A couple months ago, we watched porn together and stumbled upon a threesome video (M/F/F), and we thought it was pretty hot. A couple days later, he asked me if I wanted to add some spice to our sex life, and I said yes because I wasn't aware of what he had to purpose. He asked to have a threesome and mentioned we could hit up a bar and pick up a girl. At first I didn't feel comfortable having my man to share with someone else especially in bed. The thoughts of him fucking another girl just made me feel..exhausted and frustrated. But he kept begging me for months, and I reluctantly said yes. But we decided to come up with rules, and we were both to follow it up and promised it's the first and last time having a threesome.  So here are the rules we (mainly me) came up with: No kissing, both women have to have equal attention, no anal, and she can't stay after. He agreed and we watched some more threesome porn to give us ideas. Then last weekend came and he decided it was finally time to get it done, so we hit up a bar and talked to some girls. Well, we didn't straight up ask them to involve in a threesome. Then I noticed my boyfriend disappeared for a good 15 minutes or so, and when he came back, he asked me to wait in the car because he got someone. I was very nervous, and he brought her along to the car. We did the introductions right away, and I noticed that she was very plump. Although my size and proportions are among the average, she was obviously much plumper, bigger, and thicker.. On the way back home, my boyfriend was very bubbly and excited. We decided to check in at a motel that was close to the bar as in ""no strings attached"" type. Once we got our room, we decided to wash up first and stuff. Then my boyfriend approached me first and started making out with me which was very hot. I forgot that ""Anna"" was there and out of nowhere, she grabbed my boyfriend away and put his face between her breasts and started undressing him. I was shocked. Shocked that she made a sudden move like that and shocked to see him sucking her breasts while she was undressing him. I started feeling uncomfortable right away. The next thing I knew, they undressed each other, and she was going down on him. I had to undress myself (I still can't fucking believe it either), and I joined her to blow him. Then he ate us out, and I noticed that he was very into her large breasts, constantly rubbing the tits or squeezing it. Then let's just say that he was fucking her most of the time, and I was just next to them force-masturbating the whole fucking time. He did do a few strokes with me, but he quickly scrambled back to her. Then she started riding him while he was nibbling and sucking her breasts and at one point, I pulled out his penis out of her to give a signal that it was my turn, but he BATTED my fucking hands away and continued with their fucking. And of fucking course, she moans like a fucking whale. I just can't stand it anymore. I felt fucking embarrassed and disgusted by watching them mainly fuck while I had to sit out and force-masturbate myself. Like this wasn't our fucking deal. So I just quickly put on my night dress and left. I don't even think they noticed me leaving... Then I left and I peeked through the windows (our room was on the ground floor) and the curtains were kinda swept sideways and sure enough, they were fucking kissing and she was riding him. I felt so fucking disgusted and betrayed. I ended up sitting in the car for an hour and went back to the room and found them sleeping naked. He had his hands over her breast and shit, and I didn't want to slide into the bed. And I fucking ended up sleeping in the car (yes fun) and headed back into the room in the morning and found her blowing him. I yelled at her and told her to get the fuck out of the room and she crossed the line. She got pissed and left, and HE GOT PISSED AT ME FOR RUINING 'THE MOMENT.' We ended up fighting big time, and I told him that he was fucking her most of the time and crossed the lines and broken our promises. He was just hysterically yelling and told me things like that can happen during threesome. I just grabbed my keys and left and haven't talked to him since then. He called and texted many times, but I felt disgusted and fucking betrayed. At this point, I don't want to continue this relationship with him or even talk it out with him. Should I just break it off without meeting him or just break it off after talking it out with him?     **tl;dr**: Had threesome with my boyfriend and he just fucked another girl for most of the time and broke our promises. Should I talk with him beforehand and talk it out or should I just break it off without meeting him? **EDIT:** He just stopped by my apartment and banged on the door asking me to speak to him. He sounded like he's been crying. I think he fucking finally just realized that he fucked up. **EDIT 2:** We did lay out our rules and restrictions before sex. We didn't jump into it right away without letting her know what's allowed and what's not. **EDIT 3:** I don't know if they fucked again throughout the night without me since I slept in the car. But I wouldn't be fucking surprised if they did either","|**and she can't stay after.** Even if you were to buy the excuse ""things like this can happen during a threesome"" the fact that he let her sleep there and never once tried to figure out where you went to I think seals his fate.  And then he has the balls to yell at *you* when you walk in the next morning and they're still at it? It's way more than breaking rules.  It's breaking trust, it's hugely disrespectful, and after 5 years it shows you how he values you and your relationship.  ",2460
3kfa5d,"I lied, this is Tammy.  I am 23f and I have an 'Irish' twin, Brock [22m].  Brock is an idiot, sometimes. He can be really fun to be around, but he tends to not listen to things. If Jackass could be the life philosophy of anyone, it would be Brock. There is a reason we don't hang out much, because he always does stupid stuff. Even when I have sat down, explained in detail what I need from him, he is always saying ""he forgot.""  To be honest, at this point, I go out to a mall to hang out with him because he doesn't do stupid stuff in public. He just does it in other people's homes. Which is fucking annoying. If he wasn't my brother, I honestly don't know if I would want him around. But I love the fucker and at the moment do not want to sever contact because of stupidity, though that is not out of the question as I get older.  Right now, I guess, I am hoping he grows out of it. Hope being a delicate word.  The point of this?  Over Labor Day weekend, I went to my mom's home to see the family. We had ribs, visited, and had a great time. I went inside to change for the gym, because I had work in two hours and my mom is right down the street from my gym. So I was going to go there, change for work and shower after.  I had my phone, iPod, earphones, and Fitbit on me when I went to say goodbye to everyone. My fitbit is white and i had my huge earphones around my neck. Brock even commented on how I have 'way too much stuff to exercise with.' I was saying goodbye to my sister (who was in the pool with her son) (30f and 7 male).  Brock came up behind me and pushed me into the pool. Not only did all my things get destroyed, I hit my wrist on the side of the pool and had to miss work.  He destroyed over $1200 worth of things.  My mom yelled at Brock and he was asked to leave. I went to Urgent Care and I cracked the bone. My mom told me she was sorry it happened and my sister has now told Brock he is not to come to her home for a while or see her son, because she thinks he is dangerous in the name of a joke. Brock is really upset because he was supposed to take Nephew camping.  People have been giving Brock a lot of talks about being responsible and paying your debts. Brock has told me he is sorry, but my wrist hurts and I am really angry about what happened. He has been told not to do anything 'funny' to me because I hate it. I hate pranks because of him. I hate surprises because they always seem to be cruel.  I have not spoken to him and told him I want those things replaced ASAP. He gave me $400 and told me to ""take a joke.""  My mother came over earlier today and gave me a wrapped box. She had the receipt for the PS4 and a ton of games. She said everyone in the family pitched in because Brock wanted one, but since he destroyed all my stuff, I should return it to buy a new phone and FitBit. My phone, alone, cost about $400, so the rest of the things still had to be paid for. The total cost of the gift was about $800 (with games and accessories.)  I thanked my mom, and told her she didn't have to pay Brock's debt. She said she understood Brock would never pay it and this would be a better lesson. So I returned everything and have a new phone, iPod, earphones, and fitbit.  Now Brock is furiously sending me texts about how his birthday is ruined because I guilted Mom into ""giving up his present."" He claims he was going to pay me back ASAP, but I told him that I shouldn't have to wait months to get my things paid for because he didn't want to pay up right away. I told a few friends what happened and its 50/50. Some people said it was wrong to take his gift, as birthdays shouldn't be about getting even and he was an adult. I could have gone through small claims court.  Another friend said I should cut my brother off.  I am not sure, I just wanted to get other people's opinions on how to handle this. I am not really in the best frame of mind, as I have been typing with one hand. What do you think is the best way to handle this?  **tl;dr** Brother shoved me into a pool while wearing my electronics, my mom gave me his Bday present to cash in to pay for the items. Brother is now pissed off it happened. ","Hes ruined pranks because they arent funny, they're cruel. Then he ruined your electronics because HEY LOL. Its time he grew the fuck up and realize his shit has consequences. He has to pay debts and accept consequences. He wont pay you back? He loses gifts. He comes off as cruel and mean? His nephew doesnt go camping with him. Stand your ground with your parents. Either he gets a hint and starts being decent, or shoves off and you guys get to have less stressful lives.",2948
3kwdl0,"Update to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3koneb/my_28f_husband_26m_took_his_exs26f_side_kissed/ Hey guys, great update! First, thank you all for your outpouring of love and support! I got on this morning and was overwhelmed by all your love, help, and compassion! You guys give me hope for humanity. And thanks to the a-hole who told me I was a crazy drama whore, that my husband should dump me and get a restraining order.  So, yesterday morning, my husband took me to the doctor's, who asked me a lot of the questions you guys did. No, I didn't hit my head recently, no I don't take recreational drugs. However, I have been feeling ill lately, so the night I had the dream/hallucinations, I had taken NyQuil and Benadryl to help me sleep and not drown in my own snot. Oh, and I also had a few hot toddies, so alcohol. Apparently, Benadryl has been known to cause weird reactions in perfectly normal people. Such as vivid hallucinations or waking dreams.   So instead of scheduling expensive tests, we chalked it up to weird drug interactions, was told to come back if anything similar happened and to get a goddamn PCP. Husband took me home and I slept. Btw, while I was freaking out and still hopped up on drugs, I did check the call records, and his ex's number wasn't on the call or text list.   EDIT: Yeah, guys, in retrospect, mixing two kinds of drugs that (apparently, never knew this, and thanks for telling me, bc I wouldn't have known) do the same thing was really damn stupid. I won't be doing it again. Also probably never taking acetaminophen either, judging from some of your comments. Or alcohol. Also, I'm actually really relived I'm not alone in the whole mind-trip thing. I'm sorry for anyone who experienced what I did and doubt their own reality.   **tl;dr** NyQuil, Benadryl, and alcohol should not be mixed as Benadryl is evil. ","Thank goodness, I was hoping you would update. So glad it looks like nothing more serious than a drug/alcohol reaction. When you are feeling better, don't forget to do something extra-nice for your husband. It must have been scary and upsetting for him.",1604
3lbqwe,"I'll try to be be brief.  I'm still fuming.  My husband (M29) comes from a big family, four brothers, two sisters, raised by a single mother for the most part. The youngest of his siblings is J (M19) in the six years I've known J he's always seemed awkward and a little too quiet and socially inept.  I have always had a special fondness towards J because he's such a sweet person and I was a little awkward growing up myself. J has been struggling with some classes and I've been helping him.  My husband took me on a special dinner night to thank me for this and it was there that he revealed why J sometimes struggles.  Apparently, their dad who is now dead left their mom over accusations that J was a product of infidelity.  He was not.  But their dad was super paranoid about infidelity and treated his wife like property.  The father started abusing J when J was as young as two, beating him.  He left shortly thereafter and passed away a few years after that.   The abuse didn't stop there.  My MIL picked up where the father left off.  The beatings and abuse is too graphic and unspeakable for me to detail it here.  It's disgusting and inhumane.  My husband said that all the siblings took part including himself.  When I could no longer take listening to the details and the extent to which my husband participated I asked him why and how he could do those things.  He went into full on defense mode when he saw how furious I was and said they were told he was not their brother.  Like that's a valid excuse?  He said the family buried it and doesn't talk about it.  That J started defending himself at about 13 and the abuse stopped then.  I asked him if anybody had apologized to J.  He said he doesn't need an apology, that he just needs to forget and in time he will.   since that night three weeks ago I have been unable to be affectionate in any way towards my husband.  It's like I went from totally in love, the totally repulsed by him. He's suddenly somebody I don't even know.  I honestly don't know why J has chosen to stay around all these animals and I'm disgusted with myself for marrying one.  Last weekend we had a back yard cook out as we often do.  Most of his siblings were here.  J knocked over a pitcher of Iced tea.  He's a little shaky and a little clumsy but it was an accident obviously. My MIL went off and started berating him and called him an idiot and a few other names.  She started to berate him about his hands and how they shake so much and told him to get control of it and stop shaking.  I gave my husband a look, like, ""hey jump in here.""  He didn't do anything.  I lost it.  I went completely crazy on her and told her that maybe if she hadn't beat him and other things... At this point my husband jumped in and told me to take it easy on his mom.  I told her to leave and she told everybody to leave with her.  J only stayed because I practically begged him to stay but she told him to leave too.  I tried to talk to my husband about what happened and why I went off.  He told me to mind my own business about his family business.  I told him to leave at this point.  He reluctantly left and has been calling, and texting me non stop to forgive him.  **EDIT**  Finally heard back from a friend I had emailed.  She's a counselor.  She told me I atcually victimized J by bringing up the abuse that Friday night.  She says I should have simply stood up for him for what happened that night.  She says I should apologize to him for that and I will tonight.  She also said it's probably going to be the first and only apology J ever gets that's even remotely related to all the abuse he suffered ""so be ready for anything"".  I'm picking him up at his friend's house tonight.  His mom kicked him out over what happened.  Everything is happening so fast now.  My parents have stepped up big time and offered to move him in.  My dad is going to teach him how to drive and help him get his DL.  He's going to give him his old car that nobody drives.  Now we just have to convince him to accept our help.  Haven't read all your comments but I will.  Just things are happening fast I need to keep up.  I know my kids will be fine.  Right now I'm in full ""get J help mode.""  I have not read all your comments but I will.  Thank you all. Oh I almost forgot.  I spoke to my husband on the phone finally.  He thinks he's going to talk his way back.  I asked him why his mom kicked out J.  He said he had no idea what I was talking about, he didn't know.  J told me that my husband has been staying at his mom's and he was there when J was kicked out.  I will file divorce, no chance I'm taking him back. **EDIT**  Some of you have asked about the details of he abuse.  I left them out to spare you.  Something inside you breaks when you hear the details of what they did to J.  I wanted people to read this and not have to visualize it.  Horrible and tragic are not big enough words.   **Edit** Sorry I can't respond to every comment and thanks for some kind words.  But just too add some clarity to some questions I keep seeing.  No, he has no remorse, nor does he think an apology is needed.  He also feels no therapy is needed for anybody, just time to heal.   But at the same time he acknowledges that J's shaking and struggle are a result of he abuse.   I don't get this contradiction but I will get therapy for myself as well and try to get more answers.  Also Yes, my dad is pretty awesome, I knew he would spring into action if I just talked to him.  My mom is great too.  I knew dad would get her to sign on as well.  They like J, and they had reservations about me marrying my husband but that was for other seemingly petty reasons at the time.  I swear on my life that I did not know my husband and his family had this secret.   I only knew that they all seemed normal but J was clearly damaged.  He is very sweet natured but you can tell he has endured some things.  I always wanted to get close to him and try to understand him but I never would have guessed.      **tl;dr** **My husband participated in disgusting inhumane abuse of his youngest brother.  I want a divorce, I think I want him in jail**","If you want an outside perspective, here it is: If he was remorseful about it and genuinely felt it was wrong, then I could see you forgiving him.  However this isn't the case. I would forgive him for what he did as a kid because obviously, his mom resented J for their dad leaving and programmed the kids to abuse J.  However, seeing as now, as a functional adult, your husband refuses to apologize or even really acknowledge how damaging he was to J and even defended mom when she went to have another go, it's time to boot this man out of your life for good. However, I would also get the authorities involved. If you tell your husband to hit the curb then those feelings of abandonment will resurface, and then this will just become another relationship that J ruined in that family's eyes. You can probably save this kid's life.  Kick your husband out and offer for J to stay with you if you have the means. I wish you luck.",2043

Now everyone's making fun of me for it. They keep making small penis jokes and it hurts.  I'm really sensitive about it. I didn't have sex with my girlfriend until 10 months into the relationship because I was scared of what she would say, of what she might say to others. I'm really pissed off at her because I told her I was sensitive about it, and then she goes and basically tells everyone about it.

3mlci4,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3mdqv6/me_28_f_with_my_bf_29_m_of_3_years_his_parents/  I read all the replies and I had a long talk with my BF about boundaries. He listened, agreed with me, and decided to talk to his parents. I was hopeful and glad that he was going to do something about this, but things soon got much worse.  He returned home a few hours later with his parents! Silly me, I was assuming that they were here to apologize or at the very least have an adult conversation about everything that has been going on.   1. They accused me of trying to keep him away from them and isolate him in order to abuse and control him. I told them that I was not, and never said that he shouldn't interact with them. All I wanted was for them to respect MY boundaries and stop making unreasonable demands. They said that this is what all abusers do, and that I am showing my true colors. The messed up part is that my BF was visibly affected by all this to the point of starting to agree with them! 2. They kept insisting that I was acting guilty, and that only guilty people have something to hide, and the fact that I'm refusing to show them my bank statements prove that their suspicions are correct. I told them that it is NONE of their business, and if my BF trusts me, what right do they have to interfere with my business? At that point his dad got in my face and screamed at me about being a horrible person who abuses their son. 3. They brought up a music festival I had attended last year with mutual friends of BF and I from college. They accused me of spending that weekend away prostituting myself instead of going to the festival, and when I countered with the fact that there was an entire album full of photos on my FB, they then changed their accusation to suspecting that I was dealing drugs! This was shocking to me as I have never dealt drugs in my life, and neither my BF, his parents, or anyone else has ever accused me of dealing drugs. I pointed out that their accusations keep changing the moment the first one is proven wrong, and how exactly am I supposed to prove a negative like that? Even if I gave them my bank statements, they would accuse me of having a different account, or of hiding cash, who knows what else? I told them that it is clear that it isn't going to stop, and therefore they should just stop bothering me with their insane theories and leave me alone. I guess this was my fault for going to the festival without my BF, but I had asked him to go along repeatedly but he kept saying that he doesn't like large crowds, which I have known about him from the start. I didn't think that there was an issue since I was camping with girls and my BF also knew these people from college.  4. My BF then said that it could be a possibility that I was actually dealing drugs, that my refusal and anger at his parents' requests is making him no longer trust me and that he is starting to think ""where there is smoke there is fire."" WHAT. THE. HELL. I told him that he had never once accused me of prostitution or drug dealing before and these insane accusations only started once his parents put the idea into his head! If he was uncomfortable with me going to the festival, he could have spoken up before I bought the ticket, before I actually left, and if he was uncomfortable he could also have brought it up in the YEAR since then and now, but he didn't, and only started getting uncomfortable once his parents planted these ideas into his head. 5. I told them that I don't understand where these suspicions are coming from. I make a normal amount of money for someone in my position, I live below my means, I don't make any extravagant purchases, so why exactly do they accuse me of hiding so much money? What money? They then said that I am ""deflecting"" in order to not have to answer their accusations, that I had manipulated my BF into sticking up for me, and that the camping trip showed them how much I was abusing my BF, that their poor son has been so abused that he would deny that I was slapping him.  My BF said that since this conflict doesn't seem to be getting resolved, and since they are his parents after all and that he can't be with someone that refuses to get along with his parents, we are breaking up. Seriously. Those were his words. I am apparently the bad one in everything here and his delusional evil parents are not at fault. His parents helped him pack up and he went home with them.  His parents then said that they are going to call the cops on me for domestic violence and drug dealing. I am innocent, but I don't know what is going to happen now, if their insane calls to the cops are going to jeopardize my job in some way. I am so scared of these insane people and what they may end up doing. :(     **tl;dr**: They are all batshit insane and are seriously in need of psychiatric help.","i hope he enjoys this insane controlling relationship with his parents, because it's the only lasting relationship he's ever going to have.",3700

3n57lm,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lgroe/my_28m_largechested_gf_of_2_years_28f_was_asked/ A few things to address before I go into the actual update: I did not confront Jenna when she was going on her tirade because they were in Troy's bedroom. I have no reason to barge into someone else's bedroom to start a fight. You can stop with the pitchforks about how I was awful for not immediately wrestling Jenna to the floor in a show of manliness. Waiting for the event to pass was a much better way to handle this.  Hannah does not need you to tell her that she's wearing the wrong sized bra. She has been to ABraThatFits for fit checks, and she measures herself frequently and knows what works on her body. She has a wide range of sizes from when she was figuring out her fit size. If the measurements really don't make sense to you, I can't help you. All I can say is that she's a fat bottom girl. To the actual update:  I talked to Troy about Jenna's outburst. He said that he would handle it, and he was extremely apologetic and said that it would not happen again. He said he was glad Hannah didn't hear Jenna's tirade, and I agreed that it was for the best if we tried to handle this maturely. Hannah was still hurt from Jenna's comments on FB, but Troy asked Jenna to apologize, and that's what happened. We let Troy know that Jenna wouldn't be allowed over again if she continued to behave like that. He agreed and said he would be reconsidering their relationship. Some time passed, and here we are. Hannah has gone back to just being comfortable in her own home, taking her bra off when she gets home. She is respectful of Jenna and Troy's space and wears a bra if Jenna is over. But things changed the other night.  Hannah and I were cooking dinner when Jenna came over to wait for Troy. She hung out in the kitchen and talked to Hannah (they seemed to get along a little better at least, Hannah is very sweet and doesn't hold many grudges). I was chopping up brussels sprouts to roast while Hannah was making some herb and parm crusted chicken or something and some cucumber tomato salad that I love. She coated some huge chicken breasts that she'd pounded and that's when Jenna piped up and said something like, 'Wow, that's so much food. You're not going to eat all that, are you?' to Hannah.  Hannah laughed and said yeah, she was going to eat it all. It was her dinner. Jenna scoffed and made some comment like, ""That's so much food, I could NEVER eat that much. But well, look at me."" She got up to try and get our attention and show off her figure. Hannah didn't say anything, but I could tell by the look on her face that she was starting to panic. Hannah has a long history with ED NOS and one of her only triggers is people paying attention to what she eats like that. She used to not be able to eat at restaurants because she was afraid of people judging her.  Jenna took it a step further and said something about how she goes to the gym every day because she loves keeping her figure and she knows Troy loves it. She pointedly asked Hannah when the last time she went to the gym was and then asked me if I thought Hannah should do some kind of Yoga or something. She made some comment about how sad it is when girls ""let themselves go"" after they get boyfriends. (For the record, Hannah didn't). I was starting to get very angry because it sounded like she was implying I do not love Hannah's figure or something. I put my hand on Hannah's shoulder and told her to go to our bedroom, I could finish up. She had the fakest smile and said goodnight to Jenna. I let Jenna have it. I dont' want to go into what I said because it was not my best moment, but I could not accept her trying to intimidate or make Hannah feel bad. I especially could not take her implying at all that I wasn't attracted to Hannah. It all felt too surreal. I've never met someone who would just say mean things about a girl who was perfectly nice to her like that. Especially not about her weight.  Jenna left and told me she was going to ""have a talk with Troy."" I consoled Hannah, who said she was okay, but ended up not eating dinner. We watched some TV together and about two hours later, Troy comes in. He just stands in the doorway and looks at us and he looks right at Hannah and says ""I broke up with her. I'm so sorry. She is never coming back."" Jenna is gone and done. Troy later said that Jenna was convinced Hannah was trying to steal him and that she was just jealous of her body. It was all because of one day when Jenna came over and Hannah gushed over the dress she was wearing. Jenna thought that meant she was in love with her or something. I have no idea where this came from.  It was never about the bra I guess.       **tl;dr**: Jenna attacked Hannah after everything seemed settled. She's not coming back. ","Jenna sounds like an absolutely horrible person. Sorry you had to go through that, and kudos to Troy for dealing with it in an appropriate fashion! > Troy later said that Jenna was convinced Hannah was trying to steal him and that she was just jealous of her body. I'm wondering what sort of mental gymnastics led her to this thought. ",2949
3novni,"My wife has always been camera shy.  When we first started dating she would delete any photograph I took of her.  After a few years (we've been together 6 years total) she permitted a few if no one else saw them.  She doesn't have any social media accounts either. We got married two weeks ago.  We had a very small wedding and no honeymoon, but the wedding was really nice.  My wife looked absolutely beautiful and happy.  She doesn't really dress up and this was the first time I had even seen her in a dress, so it was a welcome surprise.   The wedding photographer was a friend of hers, so she handled hiring him.  We both agreed that we wanted candids instead of posed photos, so we told him to just take candids.  When we got the photos earlier this week, they were great, but none of them had her in them. She confessed that she paid him extra not to photograph her.  She didn't want to worry about someone taking pictures of her on her special day. Our families are asking for wedding pictures and I don't know what to tell them.  Also, I'm really mad myself and I can't seem to let this go, even though it's been a couple days.  What do I do?

I trusted her so much that I told her everything about my dad and my dead mom and how lonely I felt, and she was really helpful.  She said her dad was in the military and she understood moving around a lot.  She told me to stay after school today and she took me to Target.  Before we left she gave me a tape measure and told me how to measure myself for a bra so I did that in the bathroom (turns out I'm a 32D).   She bought me bras, curly hair shampoo/conditioner, and a book on puberty and stuff.  She asked if I wanted feminine clothes too but I said no thank you, she was already so generous.

I'll start by saying the person this been caught, i'll lead up the details. In the original post i made an small update that I was setting a trap on Facebook by posting multiple photo that were slightly different and only visible to certain groups. Unfortunately this did not work because Literotica removed this posts and the account, i'm happy its gone but i didn't have another way to find out. I tried pushing it out of my mind and took a break from social media, also my cousin Dan (police officer M/27) moved in with after this and it really helped me feel safe. For about three weeks I didn't go out aside from work and errands, put off friends who (at the time) didn't know why. I figured it was easier to shut out everyone until i was more comfortable. By this point I just accepted that it was a fucked up prank or someone else using a friends account and that i needed to move on.  Out of the blue I get a visit from a girl Lorrie, I know her as the off-on girlfriend of David (M/34) although this was my first time meeting or speaking to her. David was like a ""big brother"" to my cousin Dan; when Dan moved to LA David let him stay with him until he got a job, David helped him get his first car, David introduced him to his ex-wife and later helped him through the divorce. I always saw him as the nice guy that helped Dan and I through rough times.  Lorrie is crying and having a breakdown on my porch, I couldn't make out a word she was saying through the wheezing and sobbing. She calms down a bit and says she's called the cops on David. Then she told me everything. She had been getting into fights with him after he kept talking about me, bringing me up at inappropriate times. She was convinced he was cheating on her and she looked threw his laptop hoping to find photos or messages. She found screenshots of Literotica stories, the photoshopped pictures, and a collection of child pornography videos. My heart breaks just typing this, how can people be so fucking disgusting. He has a 4 year old daughter, they've found videos of her too. I don't know anything about the arrest other than that he can't afford post bail and called Dan and our friends begging for help after his family said they want nothing to do with him, no one will.  I don't know how to end this, I guess I really hoped this was just a fucked up joke on me but it lead to something so much more miserable.  TL;DR: My cousins mentor and family friend was caught with child pornography and the stories/photos sent to me after his girlfriend searched his computer. He's not making bail.

The issue turned into a fight, and it even got worse. She found out I had Lasik performed. I forgot to mention that in my last post. She found out and said “That was the cherry on top”.   I told her that she was acting extremely superficial and we needed to take some time apart. She didn’t even act hurt or upset. She seemed like this was what she wanted. I didn’t find out until it was too late, but she took a picture of the photo while with my mother. She claimed she wanted to keep the photo as a keepsake. After we broke up decided to snoop a little and looked at her Facebook. Everything is on private, and only a few certain little posts are made visible. She posted my photo of me in HS and wrote “Ladies, it’s never too late to cut your losses. Your future children will thank you for making the right choices in a partner” This completely floored me. This was a breach in my privacy and childhood. Public shame and admonishment was taken to the max. I called her up and my number was blocked. I sent her an email asking her to take it down. No reply. I called her parents and told them about the situation, and they said they couldn’t see the post and I told them it could just be some privacy setting she has. I check again and now I am completely blocked.  It just shocks me how she can go to this level of shaming, when I did nothing to her. It freaked her out that our children would have glasses and braces.  I have been pretty good moving on.

3pudml,"(My first post) [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pcfi6/want_some_advice_on_how_i_29f_can_come_clean_to/] tl;dr of first post: Want to tell my close friends of 6 months that I lost my husband, daughter and a pregnancy 3 years ago and have lied to them about it by omission since we met.  So I really want to first take a moment to talk about how awesome my experience in this sub has been. I knew that I wanted to tell my friends the story of my past, and I knew they would react pretty well, and I knew they'd be supportive and we'd remain close friends. I really just didn't know how to bring it up after SIX months. I don't know if I expressed it in my first post, but 6 months is kind of a long time, I feel so close to these people in so many ways, so mostly it was just weird to me to not be able to casually mention my family. I absolutely still have days where it's hard to get out of bed and I just want to be left alone to cry in the dark, but so many times I think of happy memories with my family, and adorable things Veronica did that I'm reminded of and I want to be able to pepper those into my conversations. I struggled with HOW to tell people. One on one? Big group dinner? Email? So I actually emailed them all the day after my first post here and invited them over for dinner the next night if they could make it on short notice. I said to please bring their SOs, but told Kelly I'd explain later why I think she shouldn't bring her kids this time. Honestly I was just afraid she'd get really upset and wouldn't want her kids to see her like that. She couldn't get a sitter, so her husband stayed home with the kids, but Brenda and Luke brought their SOs, and I made a huge pot of chili and some cornbread. I feel like they sensed something was up, because honestly I thought the odds of them all being able to come with one day's notice was unusual.  They showed up early evening, we sat in my living room (tight quarters!) and had some wine, and then I started. I'm an awkward person, so I basically said ""I have some big information about my past that I really want to share with you. It's not something that I share with everyone I meet and it's hard to bring up, but now so much time has gone by and I feel so close to you all, and I really want you to know this part of my life. I think it'll be emotional for you all to hear about, and I think it'll slightly change our dynamic for a while, but I'm also really excited to share this with you."" A couple of the girls were already teary. I didn't know if they'd googled me and already knew what I was going to say, or if they could just sense the emotion in my voice. I wanted the next part to be really blunt and not beat around the bush and first set it up so they wouldn't see where I was going. I said, 3 years ago my husband, 2 year old daughter and I were in a car accident when I was 5 months pregnant. My husband and daughter were killed instantly, and I lost the son I was carrying, but was otherwise physically okay. Everyone was silently sobbing at this point, including me. I told them why I moved away, why I wanted to start fresh, and why now I needed them to know my story. Kelly got up and came over and sat on the floor by my feet and cried into my lap for a while. I stroked her hair and told her it was okay, and that her kids are the first kids I had contact with since Veronica and it genuinely gave me so much joy to be around them, and that the only thing I would change is that I'd like to share stories about our kids, talk about what Veronica liked to play with or the ""words"" she would say, diaper rash. We were all still crying, but there was a lot of smiling and joking too. I tried to break the ice a little bit with Kelly and said ""you know what this means right? I have had a baby and still look hot in a bikini!"" We giggled, she said OMG I can't believe I said that, I said I take it as a compliment and assured them all I would not hold anything against them they said previously that in the light of this new information could now be seen as offensive.  It wrapped up so neatly like a goddamn sit com! I mean, they are good people and I knew it would. With all I've been through I'm choosey about who I let into my life and I could tell they were good people who would react well, but they've also all been friends for SO long, it always kind of feels like I'm the new kid and we aren't on equal footing. I am glad I told them all together though, instead of telling them individually. I honestly don't think I could have handled that emotionally, going through it took a lot out of me.  Brenda actually said that when we first met and she was looking up to see if I had Facebook, she came across a headline about my accident but didn't click on it because the headline was so horrific and she assumed it was just someone with the same name. We finally ate chili around 10:30. I do think they'll tread lightly around me for a while, but I also think this is going to bring us closer. And I don't intend to bring my family up often, but I'm glad now I can share stories about my wedding planning, childbirth, breastfeeding, etc. I never wanted someone that I could cry to about missing my family. Honestly....that's mine and mine alone. I still go to therapy, so I'm not keeping it inside, but it just doesn't work for me to express my grief over my loss to others. Thanks for helping me talk this out Reddit. Thank you to those of you who sent me PMs sharing your own losses or just wishing me well. I could not have had this particular conversation with anyone in my real life. You were really here for me. That means a lot.      **tl;dr**: I spilled my guts to my friends and it went as well as I could imagine. I think it'll bring us much closer.","I'm not going to read this because I don't want to get teary as I'm leaving work, but I'm happy for you, OP.",1099
3qzhm8,"I posted it the question here first  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lbqwe/i_f28_kicked_my_husband_out_of_the_house_in_a_fit/ But it has been deleted.  I think you can read it here https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/3ldcjd/322777772_i_f28_kicked_my_husband_out_of_the/ I filed for divorce after a few conversations with my husband.  He blames J for our divorce and became very threatening.  At one point he said he would turn walk away from me and our two kids if I didn't stop the divorce process.  I called his bluff and told him ""good, go, we would be better off.""  In my state it takes six months to finalize divorce with children involved.  I have sole custody and he never filed for joint custody which is good. Now on to J.  There's so much but I'll try to be brief.  He's in therapy and lives with my parents.  He's sticking it out with school even though he has anxiety and depression.  He's fighting really hard to heal.  Sometimes he has setbacks and is just like a broken down little boy.  He has a very strong will and spirit and sometimes I wonder how far he would have gone in life even now at 19 if the animals hadn't totally broken him. His siblings and mom still try to contact him and guilt him for not staying with his mom to ""take care of her as she ages.""  They all agreed that J's life would be to be the mother's caretaker as they all go on have live their own as they wish.  He actually feels guilty about not fulfilling that shockingly.  He has a long way to go before he realizes that his life is his to do as he wishes.  They don't have his phone number anymore but they email him.  My dad got him a new phone cause his mom would call him and berate him and guilt him.  It seemed like every conversation with her set him back two steps.  She still knows how to crush him sadly.  I wish she didn't have that power over him.  I've never wished a death penalty on somebody like I do on her. He's dating a girl and I'm scared she might hurt him (break his heart) but my dad is more encouraging of that and has to remind me to not over protect him.  J has become very close with my mom.  He drives her grocery shopping and enjoys doing that stuff with her.  My dad taught him how to drive in like one week.  He is about to go take his driving test for his DL, he's still on a learner's permit. There are a lot of positive things going on but progress is very slow and sometimes it's like watching a clock.  It just seems like he's standing still in terms of anxiety and depression.  I can't say too much about all that's going on but I can say that my parents have an attorney and are going through the adoption process.   I wanted this to be a more upbeat and positive update but honestly J struggles a lot.  Law enforcement is now involved because some of the physical abuse is more recent than I thought, just from his mom.  He has a few scars and he has broken bones that never healed properly cause he never got medical attention.  Protection orders are likely to be granted.  If they are, then according to the investigators charges will almost be inevitable.  That part of it I can't say much about but can say that J is willing to go forward with that process for now under the guidance of his therapist.  But we have been warned that he may choose to back off later.  Though one cop said there is a point of no return for the DA even without J's cooperation. **tl:dr**  **My divorce and full custody is likely.  J is fighting hard to turn things around for himself.  He has a long way to go.  It's so hard for him.  He's like a superhero the way he pushes forward.**  ","Wow OP thank you for helping him so much. If you didn't do what you did that night, he would still be getting abused by his mom. You and your family are great people, keep up with the updates if you can :)  It's good you divorced because if that's your husbands mentality, i can't imagine what justification he would have if he hit your kids in the future.  Tell J to make a new email!!!! Just so he can start fresh. Don't delete the old one in case the police need any emails from his family.  I still can't believe how everything can change so quickly! Happy Halloween OP :)",638

You gave me a lot to think about so when it came time to talk to Cindy, I wouldn't trip over my words or anything. I took her out to lunch yesterday (Sunday), and just very matter-of-factly told her how I was tired of her disparaging my bf, how I was tired of her putting down nursing as a profession and dismissing it just as ""women's work"", and finally told her that despite her insistence that she was just joking, I found her ""jokes"" offensive and was done with hearing them. I made it very clear that my boyfriend hadn't sent me to defend him but that I was the one who was offended and tired of it. She started to cry a little (which was alarming) and broke down and told me why she was doing what she was doing. Apparently, long story short, in her first marriage, Cindy's income was more than double of that of her husband. After a year or so of marriage, he quit his job and ended up just mooching off of her. He became incredibly emotionally abusive and ruined her financially until she was able to get out and leave him. Basically--she was nervous that the same would happen to me, and she hoped that her ""jokes"" would sway my opinion enough to leave my bf.  I was kind of ??????? about her explanation, but she told me that she knew the jokes were childish and offensive, but she didn't know how else to go about it. She said that I was the closest thing to a daughter she had, and that she loves me very much and that she felt awful about everything. I started getting teary at this, and I told her that the jokes especially hurt from her because she's someone I care deeply for, and she apologized profusely for having offended/hurting me. She said she really thought my boyfriend was a nice guy and that she wanted to get to know him better, which thrilled me.  I went home, told my boyfriend (who didn't know why I was gone, I wanted to be covert about it), and he was thrilled. He told me that secretly he WAS upset about the jokes, as he knew that Cindy was someone I cared a lot for, but put on a game face because he didn't want to drive a wedge in between us. He told me he loved me, and thanked me for standing up for him, and said he's looking forward to getting to know Cindy better too! And my dad is over the moon as well :) Thank you for your advice, all! <3 Communication really is key.     **tl;dr**: Cindy and I talked, she apologized, my boyfriend is happy, my dad is happy, and my family is the best :)","Whew, reasonable people for a change.

Yesterday evening my wife went over to our neighbours apartment. While she was gone, I snooped through her texts and her e-mail. It pretty much confirmed that she was cheating on me with the guy I was messaged about. But that wasn't it. There were 2 other guys she's cheating on me with and one of them has a girlfriend.  So that's where we are right now. My marriage is done and I feel depressed.  EDIT: I can't thank you guys enough for the advice. Seriously thanks.     **tl;dr**: She's cheating.","Shit mate you know what you need?  A beer.  Not lots. Just one. Its midday and you Americans need to learn to pace it.

3rg439,"7 years ago when I [17M] was preparing for college at 17 I was trying to find scholarships.  I applied to a scholarship run by a local family using money from a man in the family who was very wealthy. They eventually announced that a girl from our town had won and I thought nothing of it. My brother [27M] is now in AA and is ""making amends."" He admitted to me that I won the contest.  He said that an old teacher of his was on the scholarship board and saw him at the store, and brought it up to him assuming we knew. But we didn't know as the letter hadn't come in the mail yet. But after she said something he knew, and when the letter came he took it.   He was mad at me at the time (now he doesn't even remember why) and says that he responded to the letter thanking them but  telling them I had received a full ride scholarship to the school of my choice and no longer needed funding.  He gave them his own cell phone number and said they could call him with any questions.  He says they did and he just convinced them I didn't need the scholarship and they should give it to someone else, so they did. He admits it was shitty of him but doesn't seem to think it was a big deal. He doesn't even see the value of the money lost because I still got to go to college, but the difference was that I ended up 40k in debt with student loans.  I still owe 35k and the interest is counting. The scholarship would have paid out a total of 45k over the course of my college education as long as I maintained minimum grades.  His prank cost me tens of thousands of dollars. I know he's in AA and the goal is to make amends and fix relationships, but this honestly makes me never want to see him again. I spent college SO incredibly stressed over money and this could have solved so much of it, and he did this over something he can't even remember now. Where do I go from here? Am I ""supposed to"" let this go?  Sorry this is kind of a rant, I don't really know what I'm asking other than just general advice of how this should affect my relationship with him. I feel like I don't want any relationship with him at all now but I know I might regret that years down the road.     **tl;dr**:  My brother was mad at me and did something that caused me to lose tens of thousands of dollars. He's admitting it now as part of AA. How do I keep a relationship with him when I've never been more angry with someone in my life? Should I even try?","What he did was awful, but what sticks out for me is that he doesn't seem to care how it's affected you, nor can he even remember what ""provoked"" him. Your brother owes you, in the very least, a real apology, one which acknowledges how his actions seriously affected you and your future. ",3129

So, about a month ago I saw Earl, my PTSD ridden coworker, sneaking out of the women's bathroom. Later we got a nastygram from office management demanding to know who soiled the women's bathroom-- here was not only a mess in the middle of the floor but the feces was smeared all over the walls, with a 'Hi Larry' (our office manager) written in fecal matter on the mirrors followed by a 'Fuck Suzanne' written on another. Suzanne is the manager that works on the isolated floor and one of the few females on the floor. So...long story short, I ended up giving my buddy that works in security a heads up that I saw Earl sneaking out of the women's bathroom. Suzanne found a...'handprint' on her car door handle that day too. Security checked the tapes but of course they didn't catch shit (some of the cameras were out). Earl wasn't questioned right away, and for the most part, people forgot about the incident (except Suzanne). The other day, Suzanne came to work and found a huge dump right in the middle of her cubicle. Several of her things had been ""touched"" or knocked over. She immediately lost it, and ran straight to security. Fortunately, since the incident, cameras that were on her floor were now running...and lo and behold....Earl was on her floor at 5:30am. Earl's punch in time is usually 8:15. He was questioned and he had no viable reason for why he was there that early in the morning, and on Suzanne's floor. A search of Earl's locker uncovered soiled rags and a filthy t-shirt. Earl has been moved to an offsite pending an HR investigation. We're all guessing he's going to be canned. In the mean time, should he come to the office while I'm there, I'm running out the emergency exit. (I'm convinced he knows).     **tl;dr**: Earl was caught ""red"" handed. He is now the subject of an HR investigation and has been moved to an offsite far away from the general work population.",I'm guessing Earl's got some issues...do be careful.  Ask security to keep an eye on you and Suzanne when you go to/from your car.,1536

Strange behavior and circumstances makes me suspicious. Found pictures on facebook of him with a girl. Can't prove whether that girl is his ""ex"" or not. Looking for advice. [Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rdxxz/update_i_21f_suspect_that_i_might_be_my_boyfriend/) **tl;dr** Y'all were right. He's a lying, cheating asshole. I found texts on his phone that Tim is still with Stephanie and that they live together. It was her in the pictures from when he went home in the summer. I'm going to break up with him and tell her about me. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.  Again, I'd like to start off this post with a thank you to everyone who responded with constructive and helpful advice. I read every comment, reply, and PM.  So, I took your advice and did not try to have a conversation with Tim. I realized that since he was so successfully able to manipulate me for two years, having one last conversation with him was bound to end up with me doubting my findings and perhaps my sanity.  I wrote Stephanie a three page letter, detailing the relationship that Tim and I have had over the past two years. Making clear that it was serious and not just a fling. I mentioned dates and events that most people would not have known about, and I included the intricate lies and back story that he had told me. I included a list of dates from the last 2 months that he spent the night with me and encouraged her to cross check them with nights that he wasn't at home. I printed out a few photos of us as a quick visible proof, and I included the rest of the photos on a usb stick in the letter. The stick also contained screenshots of any particularly incriminating conversations that we've had over the last few months. I scanned postcards that he had sent me from various vacations and included those as well. For safe measure, I also included a copy of the letter, in case the hard copy went somehow mysteriously missing. I gave her my email address and phone number and asked her to contact me if she wanted to. On Wednesday night, I had someone drive me to where she lives. If Tim was there, I would just have confirmations that he actually lives there and we'd leave. If he wasn't there, I'd ring the doorbell and hand her the letter personally. We drove the 45 km and Tim was sitting there in the living room on his laptop. It was obvious he lived there. She was nowhere to be seen. His and her names were on the mailbox. I called to see if he'd pick up and he ignored the call. We headed back home.  On Thursday morning, I mailed the letter. I ensured that it was registered post. In order to receive the letter she'd have to show her ID and sign for it. On Friday the letter arrived. She was not home, so she received a notification to go pick the letter up at the post office. On Saturday morning she picked it up and I got an email of the receipt with her signature on it.  Throughout all of this, I conversed normally with Tim and made excuses as to why he couldn't come over during the week, so as to not tip him off to anything. He stopped talking to me about 20 minutes after she picked up the letter Saturday morning, and I have not heard from him since. He has, however, defriended me and my family on Facebook. I have not heard from Stephanie either. So, now it's really over. I hope with my whole heart that he was not able to lie and manipulate his way out of the situation with her, but I will probably never know. I do not expect to hear from him again.  I feel very lonely, taken advantage of, and beaten down. I am going to do my best to try to come out of this situation without trust issues and without being cynical and jaded. I am seeking therapy to make sure I don't slip into depression. For now, I need to find ways to distract myself and fill up any free time.  Thanks again for all your help, /r/relationships. This really sucks, but I'll get through it and hopefully be a stronger person for it.  **tl;dr** Sent Stephanie the letter. Haven't heard from Tim since she received it. He defriended me on facebook. Don't expect to know any of the outcome or ever hear from him again.  **quick edit** I forgot to mention that I'm going to go get tested on Tuesday to be safe. Obviously if anything comes out of that, I'll do my best to notify both of them. ",You did the right thing. The right thing is not always easy and it does not always feel good. ,2277
3s6fna,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3qg3i8/my_boyfriend_30m_of_16_years_wont_commit_to_me/) I just wanted to thank every one of you who took the time to read my first post and for all of the support I've received since. A lot has happened in the last couple of weeks, so I figured I'd post an update.   I hired a lawyer and moved out one day while Rick was at work.  Because my name is on the title and the mortgage, my lawyer assures me he either has to sell the house and split the profit with me, or buy me out.  I know he can't afford to buy me out, so I assume we'll put it up for sale.  I get most of my things out of the house, except for a vanity and a dresser that are too heavy for my friends and I to move.  I moved out the day before Halloween.   Since then, I've messaged Rick a few times to see what we're going to do about the house and to schedule a time to come pick up the rest of my furniture.  He's pretty evasive about all of it, so last Thursday I showed up at the house with some friends to help me get my stuff.  He's changed the locks, so I can't get in.  We wait for him to get off of work and come back, and he lets me in to get my stuff.  All he said before he let me in was ""You asked for this, so I don't want to hear it"".  I didn't know what he meant. I was absolutely not prepared to walk through that door, but when I did it became obvious why he didn't want me to come pick up my stuff.  I didn't even recognize the house that I lived in just a week prior.  It was painted, there was furniture and art and things everywhere, and I could tell by looking around that Rick didn't do this by himself.  There are pictures of him and some woman all over the place.  They have to go back at least a year, because one of them was taken on New Year's, though I couldn't tell what year.   I just left.  I can buy more furniture, but I couldn't spend a second more in that house.  Rick texted me right after I left saying ""we're not selling, we're just going to buy you out"".  I was at a complete loss for words.  I'm still in shock.  I spent 16 years with that asshole, and he was with someone else for who knows how long.   I'm trying to get over it the best I can, but it's hard.  It would be hard leaving just because we've been together so long, but to find out that your life was pretty much a lie was a hard pill to swallow.  What hurts even more is that for years I tried to decorate my house to make it a home and he wouldn't let me.  She couldn't have lived with him for more than a week, and the house already looks different.   I honestly don't know how I was so blind, but I'm glad I got out when I did, even if he did waste half of my life.   **tl;dr**:  I ended a 16 year relationship because my fiance is seemingly uninterested in committing to me, only to find out that he was dating someone while we were together, and they've now moved into our home together.    **Edit to add mini update:** I just want to thank everyone again for all of their support.  A lot of you pointed out that my name would still be on the mortgage even if I sell, so I've decided not to sign the paperwork accepting the buyout.  Rick was not okay with this, and has been blowing up my phone ever since he found out today calling me a ""petty bitch"", and that I was just trying to ruin his life because he was finally happy.  I know they're both pissed off because they put a lot of effort into the home in the short time since I've left, and honestly I kind of feel better that they won't be able to enjoy it.  I know it sounds terrible, but making this harder on them is making me feel better about the entire situation.  For the majority of our relationship, I felt like he was always the one in control of everything.  It's nice to have the final say. I know I've said a lot how he's wasted half of my life, and I'd like to clarify that I don't think I'm too old or that it's too late for me, just that I couldn't understand why this man would string someone along for as long as he did.  He's pretty much all I've known, and it took a lot for me to leave him.  I feel like I've missed out on a lot of the dating experience, but I think I'll be okay.  I'm just going to enjoy being alone for right now. Since I moved out I've been staying with a friend.  I signed a lease for a one bedroom apartment today, so by this time next week I'll have my own place.  I've already bought a bunch of things to decorate it with, and I didn't have to get anyone's permission to do so :)  ","I'd be super fucking petty about this and refuse to let them buy you out. Talk with your lawyer and a realtor and see what option is best for you financially, and go with that one, even if it means playing hard ball and forcing them to sell.

3sant7,"[Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rs0rh/me_intern_21_m_with_my_boss_41_m_i_forgot_to/) So pretty much all of the advice in the original thread was useful, but some of the best advice came from users like /u/frehsprints (who pointed out that I was probably misunderstanding what my boss meant by ""reimbursement"") and /u/mawkish, who stressed going through every available channel with the software company to get a refund and making my boss explicitly request money.  Anyways, on to the actual update. After I emailed the software company and they refused to refund it, I emailed my boss letting him know that, and that's when he dropped the reimbursement line. I still don't know exactly what type of reimbursement he was looking for, but I'm fairly certain now that what he meant was that he'd have to get it from the budget of the small team I work in and he runs, which would be a waste of money. He also CC'd our office assistant and told her to help me figure this out.  A few hours later, she emailed back saying she'd talked to the software company on the phone and they stuck to their guns and offered a credit, and that was the best/only option. After seeing all the comments in the original thread, I gave it another shot and called the company. I basically reiterated that we've been loyal customers and would like to continue, but that wouldn't be possible if we weren't refunded. I escalated to a manager, who was more than understanding and got the refund processed!  I then emailed only my boss (didn't wanna make the assistant feel like I did something she couldn't) saying the refund was being processed and sent him a receipt. His exact response was ""Good job /u/saltymuffaca. Stuff happens, the key is that you were adamant about it and got it fixed."" Luckily, my boss thinks I handled the situation well, and all is well!  tl;dr - happy update, I escalated the situation, got the refund when others couldn't, and my boss thinks I handled everything well",Well done! I'm sure this reflects well on you and your future employment there,1380

I'm really thankful to everyone who answered and comforted me. You guys gave me the strength to look forward and not make a decision based on nostalgia. I felt really alone in my pain but thanks to you i felt a little less lonely.  So Mark wanted to meet on sunday but i unblocked him from my phone and told him i didn't want to meet and to please not contact me anymore, he answered ""Please baby i need to talk to you, can we meet another day? I know i fucked up really bad and hurt you deeply but i'll do anything to make it up to you, anything you ask i'll do it...'' needless to say it just angered me more, how dare he use terms of endearment with me. I just blocked him again after that. I met his mom on saturday and told her to proceed with the notification of cancellation. We had an emotional moment and she told me even though she would have really wanted us to stay ''One big family'', she would have done the same in my place. She had hoped i would find the strength to forgive him but she understands. And so the wedding is indeed still being cancelled. My poor brother ( i told him personally) had already bought his plane tickets from Australia but got a refund. I rearranged all the furnitures in the house and bought new bedding sets, to make a new start and moved to the spare room for good. It looks really different and i like it. Apparently he told our friends because some brought it up to me, asking if we are getting back together, but said they ''didn't want to side''.  On sunday evening i had a visitor. I never have people coming this late usually, it was around 9pm. When i went to look through the peephole i saw Mark, **with his ex**. I seriously had a moment of panick. He must still have the key for the main entry since he managed to get to my door without using the intercom. I don't know if it was a coward thing to do but i just chose not to open. I know they knew i was there and i heard him ask me to ''Please let him in, that he just wanted to talk'' through the door. Honestly even though i feel better i don't think i'm emotionally stable enough to deal with him and especially him with his ex. They stayed about 15 minutes and then they left. I thought he would get the message but they came again yesterday around the same time!! And i didn't open again. They waited even longer. I know i'm not being an adult.  So now i don't know what to do. I feel nervous in my own house because i dread the moment they'll come back. He knows my schedule and he came at the time where i usually come back from my zumba class. However yesterday was a holiday so we didn't have class. I'm afraid he will come again and i don't think i can face him. What should i do? I know i can't run away forever but i need more time. Is this worth calling the police over? I fear it would make the problem bigger than it is and hurt our family relations, our moms are really close. And really he is not dangerous, i think. He didn't contact me enough for it to be considered harassment anyway. Should i just be a big girl and open the next time he or they come? Or do i wait it out? Also why the hell is he bringing her? I'm curious but i want to stand by my decision.  **tl;dr: I decided not to take him back and told his mom to send the notification of cancellation to the guests. I refused to meet him on sunday but he came in the evening with his ex and again yesterday night. What should i do. Can i just keep on avoiding them or do i have to have that talk i do not want to have?**     ","Make use of his family connections.   Call his mom, explain that he has dropped by and that you want him to stop.  Tell her that he has come by your place twice already but you did not want to talk to him or let him in.  Tell her that he is not welcome to come by your home.  If there's a third visit, you will be forced to pursue a restraining order and you would rather not have to go that road. Also worth mentioning that he was with the girl when he dropped by.  My bet is that he thinks you talking to her will persuade you that there is ""nothing"" between them. He likely thinks the reason you will not take him back is because you do not believe that the relationship between them is over.  The reality is that you will never take him back because he shattered the trust, his current relationship status has zero bearing on that shattered trust.  Also, move.  Start the process of finding a new appartment.  If you are locked into a lease talk with your landlord and explain that you have an Ex who keeps coming around even after he's been told not to.  Lots of landlords have more than 1 apartment building and might be able to accommodate you moving into another of their units (my dad owns a few buildings and has done exactly this on more than one occasion).

3t6azu,"Previous Post:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3sx3rk/my_28m_friendscoworkers_20s_mf_are_mocking_my/ tl;dr: My wife and I are in an arranged marriage, my friends and co-workers have mocked and made fun of both her, and our marriage, how can I deal with this? while also helping my wife feel better and more confident? After reading through the comments on my previous post, it really surprised and shocked me how many people thought my friends were racist, bigots, or assholes. It struck a chord deep in me with how many outsiders had such a different perspective on the issue, where I thought I wasn’t being firm enough and my friends were just ignorant in terms of the ramifications of their actions, whereas the vast majority of commentators thought they were just plain assholes and racists. I guess I was hoping if I was simply firm in my resolve, and told them in no uncertain terms if their disrespectful behavior were to continue we could no longer continue socializing, they would see the error in their ways and hopefully apologize to my wife.  So yesterday, I asked them if we could all meet up to discuss something important, and after work we all went for drinks. Once we started talking, I told them how disrespectful they were being towards both my wife and I, and addressed how much it had hurt my wife to be made fun of just because of her accent and ignorance when it comes to American customs. I continued by saying that I understand we usually joke about these sorts of topics, such as race, but that I now realized how wrong it was and it all needed to stop. They did not take me seriously at all. Immediately everyone began commenting on how much of a “bitch” I’d become since getting married, and I was always so prissy and sensitive about shit we’d used to laugh about all the time. They continued by saying I never enjoyed myself anymore, and how I’d basically abandoned our group because I was always spending time with my wife. I was constantly trying to respond, or defend myself, but the fuckers kept interrupting me and wouldn’t let me say anything. They also said I stopped partying like I used to, like what the fuck? Sorry I’m not interested in getting shitfaced at the club every Friday night, we’re not in college anymore. Then one of the guys says, “Are you being all uptight because you’re not getting laid anymore? I’m surprised man, if my wife was as hot as (my wife’s name) I’d be banging the shit out her everyday.” Then all of them fucking laughed like he’d made a hilarious joke instead of being a massive douche bag. After that I was done with them, and told them they I no longer wanted to socialize with people who were being completely disrespectful and held bigoted attitudes towards my wife, then left.  Once I got home, my wife immediately asked what was wrong. I suppose I must’ve still looked pissed off over what transpired.  I told her how sorry I was over the way I handled the situation, and she would no longer have to deal with their mocking and bullying. She looked extremely guilty that I said this, and told me I didn’t have to sacrifice my happiness and friendships just to please her, and I should continue hanging out with them if I really wanted to. I don’t know, I’m kind of embarrassed to admit it but I started crying like a baby. This women, who’d left everything behind, her life, family, friends, to travel halfway across the world to a completely different country all on the promise that I would provide her with a better life, thought this entire situation was her fault, and was saying I should prioritize my happiness over her own feelings or well-being. It broke me, and made me realize what a selfish prick I was. So I spent over an hour convincing her this wasn’t her fault at all, and that she should never believe my feelings are more important than her’s, and whenever she is feeling hurt, or angry, she should express those feelings without ever thinking it was wrong to do so. I’m very saddened by how long I had allowed this to transpire, and have a ton of making up to do.  Also, I just wanted to express my thanks reddit. This was the main reason I posted an update, your guys’ comments really helped take the wool off my eyes and understand the reality of the situation. We’re in a much better place now because of it, and I truly do appreciate everything, thank you.        **tl;dr**: Got rid of my friends, you were right they are bunch of assholes","You're a good man, OP, and I know you will find friends who are not pricks and will not make fun of you and your wife.",2271
3tando,"Original :https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3t2ext/my_27m_girlfriend25f_has_had_the_flu_for_several/ So, holy inbox batman, logged into this account and had over 200 replies and messages. Anywho, went to her place yesterday and she looked a lot better, but wasn't feeling the best. Pretty much dragged her to the car and took her to our local clinic. They said she had something called Gastroenteritis, which they felt was caused by contiminated food. So yeah, wasn't the flu like a lot of you guys were telling me, but I am not the smart one, she is, I just work at a factory. She was sick, I assumed the flu, sue me. Anyways, they said she was over the worst of it, but that she was almost dangerously dehydrated, so they gave her a fluid IV yesterday. Afterwards they told me to get her to consume food and drink with electrolytes, so I have made her drink gatorade and eat bannas(What they told me) yesterday and today. They told me that if it ever happens again, to bring her in earlier so as not to allow dehydrataion to become that advanced. Good to know. As to where to got it, she told me she ate from a truck stop heat lamp food stash last Friday, because she was in a hurry, so hopefully she won't do that again.  Thank you for all the kind compliments, I really didn't think I went above and beyond in what I did, I just know that I love her and she needed some help cleaning up. I have decided to take everyone's advice here and since our door talk, act as if it never happened, which she is doing as well. Also, to the people who asked, no, I do not work in the medical field, I work at a factory. I did however have a grandmother with Alzheimer's that lived with us when I was a teen, and I had to help clean her and take care of her, because my parents were too grossed out most of the time, and too cheap to get a live in nurse or something like that. I am not new to bodily fluids. Anyways, thanks to everyone who advised me that she was just embarrased and I didn't do something out of turn. Also, thanks to everyone who showed concern about her health.     **tl;dr**:Wasn't the flu, you guys right, took her to clinic, she was dehydrated, doing much better today",You're a good bloke. ,2227
3tbtre,"Throwaway because the wife knows my main. Sorry in advance for this rambling mess. Since my wife and I got married three years ago, things have been…off. I know that people grow and change with time, but around our wedding, my wife changed drastically. She bleached her dark brown hair blonde right before the ceremony, and I honestly thought I was in the wrong church for a split second when she came down the aisle. We moved into our house right after the honeymoon, and she went into full domestic mode. We’d shared cleaning duties before, but once we moved into the house, she became INSISTENT on doing everything before I could even get to it. Since this is our first house, I thought it was some kind of homeowner nesting thing, but it never stopped. Her hair color is none of my business and I think most people would be happy not to have to clean, so I honestly didn’t really think much of either of those things at the time. The big thing has always been how closed off she got after the wedding. When we were dating, she’d tell me long rambling stories about her feelings and rant to me when she was upset and all that, and I liked hearing about what was going on inside her head. After the wedding, that stopped pretty abruptly. If I ask her how her day is, she will only ever tell me that it was “fine!” or “super!” She doesn’t talk to me about her feelings anymore, ever, even when I explicitly ask “how do you feel about x?” She also stopped telling me about anything important that happened to her. About a year after we got married, her grandfather died. Did she tell me she’d lost her grandfather? No. She told me that she had to go to a conference for work on the other side of the country, which I thought nothing of. On the second day she was gone, her older brother texted me to tell me that my in-laws had really missed seeing me at the funeral. When I called her to ask why in the ever loving hell she didn’t tell me, and then LIED about it, all she would say was “I didn’t want to trouble you. You have a lot on your plate”. After that, she went on a couple of “spontaneous family trips”. She’s really, REALLY close to her family, so the first time she said she was going camping with her brother at their alma mater, I didn’t think a lot of it other than to be slightly disappointed and confused that I wasn’t invited, because her brother’s cool and the three of us go camping together a lot. But the second time, I started hearing alarm bells.  I’d like to say I’m a more secure man, reddit, but after the second “spontaneous family trip”, my wheels started spinning and I started to think that maybe she was cheating. This was a weird insecurity in the back of my mind for a while, since she wasn’t showing any other big signs of cheating (she wasn’t guarded about her phone and hadn’t changed her routine/appearance). A few weeks ago, she told me she was pregnant. I was over the moon about it until I asked her how many weeks along she was, and she nonchalantly said “about 12 or 13”. She’d been pregnant for like three months before she even bothered to tell me! She’s not really showing at all, and she doesn’t usually drink, so I had been completely in the fucking dark. I honestly hadn’t even suspected.  That was kind of it for me. I was sure she was cheating, and that it wasn’t my kid. I thought there was no possible way that a woman would keep her pregnancy a secret from HER HUSBAND for three months. So I snooped. Yes, I know I was wrong, but I wanted proof that she’d been having an affair before I moved out. One of my best buddies from college is a divorce attorney, and when I asked him what I should do, he sent me the info for a key logger. I installed it on my wife’s laptop and was prepared for the worst. Now, I feel like what I found is somehow worse than her cheating. I didn’t find any steamy messages, but I found out that she keeps a diary in a word document that she writes in every day. I know I should have just stopped once I knew she wasn’t cheating, but once I saw my name in her diary, I couldn’t stop. I read all of it. All seven separate documents, going back to way before we’d even met.   Turns out she’s not cheating. She’s depressed as fuck, hates herself, and has absolutely no trust in me. All of the stuff I’d been confused and bothered by has some kind of sad, self-loathing explanation. She hates having blond hair, but she writes “I know he’d divorce me if I went back to being a brunette, because wives are supposed to be blond” almost every week. The “wives are supposed to be” thing is tangled up in everything. She thinks wives are supposed to be quiet, which is why she doesn’t talk to me anymore. She thinks wives are supposed to “make things easier for their husbands, not harder”, which is why she didn’t tell me when her grandfather died. It just goes on and on and on. She didn’t tell me when she got a huge promotion and a raise because “he’d leave me in a heartbeat if he knew I made more money than he does. Men can’t handle that”. It hurt to know that she thinks of me as some kind of one-dimensional 1950’s husband, and I’ve been wracking my brain to think of anything I could have done to make her think this way.  What I can’t handle is that she’d lied about the big stuff. I honestly don’t know if I can forgive her for not telling me about the miscarriages. The “spontaneous family trips” were actually her miscarrying two of our children, one at five weeks, the other at about 10. She went and stayed with her parents while she was recuperating, and her brother and sister came to support her. But not me. I didn’t get to be there for her, because she thinks I would leave her immediately if I knew that she’d “killed” our children. She’s convinced that she caused both miscarriages because she smoked pot for a long time before we got married. For what it’s worth, it sounds like her family tried both times to get her to tell me, but she wouldn’t. She finally told me about this pregnancy because her parents threatened to tell me she didn’t.  I’m just absolutely fucking dumbfounded. I don’t even know what to think right now. I’m just so baffled because everything she says about me in her diary is insanely nice. She goes on for pages and pages about how much she loves me and how she thinks I’m her soul mate and how she would do anything for me. I just can’t understand why she thinks that I would leave her. Knowing that she’s spent the last three years walking on eggshells around me, convinced that I would leave her at the drop of a hat is just so…confusing and awful. I feel like our marriage is some kind of lie. The woman I thought was self-confident and ready to take on the world is actually full of self-loathing and really, really, REALLY depressed. I don’t know her at all. She’s been suffering silently with depression long before we met. She has no faith in me, no trust. She thinks that every hug and kiss I give her and every “I love you” I say is a lie.  I just don’t know what to do. She obviously needs serious help, but I don’t know how to get it for her. I can’t tell her that I read her diary. If she has zero trust in me now, I can’t even imagine what she’d think if she knew if I read six years worth of her private thoughts. I feel like I need to get my in-laws on board somehow, but I don’t know what to say to them. I know I can’t ignore this, but I feel like any move is the wrong move. What do I do?? Tl;dr: thought wife was cheating so I snooped and read her diary. She's actually insanely depressed, has secretly miscarried two of our children, and doesn't trust me one iota. How do I get her help without making things worse? Edit: after I posted this I realized I'd kind of omitted the deal with the key logger. It's worse than it sounds, honestly. After it showed me what she'd written that day I went onto her computer while she was sleeping and opened up Word. I saw that she had several documents called ""diary year x"" so I downloaded them all onto a flash drive and read them at work. I went too far, I know.","I think I'd consider discussing everything you know with a professional, and see what they suggest the next step is. ",2831
3tr2ur,"Alright, so a lot has gone on in the last 24 hours...so...here we go. [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tmbcn/my_21f_boyfriend_25m_of_7_months_has_a_female/) Okay, so I was not expecting this much attention or advice, so thank you to everyone who took the time to help me out. The major consensus was that I was NOT over-reacting (I really didn't think I was either!!) and that Ali's behaviour was not cool. So, Rick and I were hanging out last night, and I took the advice of /u/cold08 and, at a suitable time, asked him how HE feels when Ali's sitting on his lap, etc. and if he would feel comfortable telling me what's going on in his head at those times. He told me (exasperatedly) that nothing goes on in his head since they are just friends and he doesn't know what else to tell me (shocker). I mentioned that I had made this post. He asked to see it. I thought it might make him see things more clearly, that her behaviour is inappropriate, but he actually got angry...(we've never really fought before).  I think he was upset because he knew he was wrong. But basically he was like ""so, what now? I can't be friends with her anymore? I can't have any female friends because you're threatened?"" I explained I'm not threatened persay, and I would never ask him to de-friend anyone, but I feel disrespected when she does these things and asked if he'd be willing to ask her to back down a bit.  Well, he broke down and told me that he had lied to me. They have slept together before (numerous times, mostly while drunk at parties, etc). And there are underlying feelings (SHOCKER). He says he doesn't have them for her, but she's expressed hers to him before. He says he isn't interested in pursuing a relationship with her at all, but she does get jealous and tries to mark her territory. Apparently, this has caused issues in previous relationships (on both sides) and he DOES know it's a problem. But he does not want to hurt her feelings because she's sensitive (the fuck?). Basically, I broke up with him after that. Not only was I PISSED that he blatantly lied to my face about anything happening between them, but he put her before me anyways by refusing to cut back her inappropriate behaviour or telling her to stop. And I don't think he ever would've put me first anyways. I told him I refuse to be anyone's second choice, and did not want be put in between this drama. I also told him he needs to figure his shit out otherwise he's going to fuck up every good relationship he has. He tried to beg me not to go, but fuck that shit.  I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm SO PISSED OFF and seriously want to go punch this stupid bitch in the face, and maybe kick him in balls too, but, since life doesn't work that way, here I am. 7 months wasted, but lesson learned. I'm going to my friend's for wine night tonight, and I'm going to have a good fucking time. I'm annoyed that she ""wins"" in a way now, but, I deserve better so...bye felicia. Thanks again to everyone for their advice, it's much appreciated and made me realize a lot of things I didn't see. So thank you for that :) **tl;dr**: (Ex) boyfriend was a liar, and was never going to put me first. So I dumped him and I'm better off.

3v0qwm,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nv9fc/i_35_m_feel_like_i_made_a_huge_mistake_by/) a few weeks ago about the resentment I started to feel towards my wife after I had been promoted at work. I just want to say thank you all for the advice and I have a very happy update for you all. I took a week to think about the post and my own feelings. I talked it out in therapy and I came to the conclusion that I could not keep working 70 hours a week. It was destroying my relationship with my wife and son and it was also destroying my happiness. I spoke to my boss and he was very understanding and told me that there was enough in the budget to hire an assistant for me. My assistant started two weeks ago and my work load has been dramatically reduced. I have been able to work a normal 40 hour work week and I am now finally coming home before 6:00 PM each weekday! I spoke with my best friend about my wife and he knocked some sense into me. He told me how jealous he and the rest of our friends were over my wife and how lucky I was to be with a woman who is super-model attractive, yet driven and kind and compassionate like my wife. Later that night, I drank a bottle of scotch and got sloppy drunk. My wife found me puking in the bathroom and in my drunken haze I confessed to her everything I was holding back. I told her about how I felt left out because I wasn't around for our son, how I didn't feel connected to her like I wanted to be, the whole nine yards. She held me and let me cry it out and she told me that she loved me. The wife and I are headed to couple's counseling, but we also signed up for cooking classes to build a common hobby. She says that she will stay by me as long as I stay be her, no matter what happens. I love her and she loves me and I think we are going to be okay. One last detail that I can't think to put anywhere else: All three of us are taking a month-long vacation after Christmas in order to have family bonding time. Wife and I both agree that we need this vacation.     **tl;dr**: Pulled my head out of my ass and told my boss that I had too much work to handle. I got an assistant and relieved myself from that stress. I spoke with my best friend who knocked some sense into me about how wonderful my wife is. She and I are going to counseling and we are going to work it out.",Good for you (and your family). I love happy updates.,1147

He wants me to pay him $50 per day for use of it. I am upset by this, but I think that maybe I am just being too sensitive. *** Hey, everyone. I know a lot of you have been wanting an update. I meant to post one way a few days ago, but things have been really busy lately. I didn't want to ruin my Thanksgiving holiday thinking about the car situation, so I decided to wait until I got back to discuss it with my boyfriend. I was really hoping that this was all just a misunderstanding, but unfortunately it was not.  When I brought up the rental payment, my boyfriend said that he thought it was only fair that I compensate him for the use of his car. He asked me if I had a problem with that, and I told him that I did. I mentioned what some of you said about how I could have rented a car for less if I had known he was going to charge me. I also told him how I felt like he had taken advantage of me by only mentioning the fee after I had taken his car.  One thing that one of you mentioned was that maybe someone had suggested it to him. I asked him about that, and he said that no one had said anything. He just figured that it would only be fair for me to pay for the use of his car. I did at least get him to see that the price he charged me was too high, but he didn't think he was wrong about the fee. We ended up having a larger conversation about how tight he is with money and some other things I mentioned in my first post. I didn't intend to break up with him, but after he still insisted on the rental payment, I just realized that he was not someone I wanted to be with. I did end up paying him, but it was $100 instead of $250. So that's the update. He has apologized and asked me to take him back, but I don't think I'm interested anymore. Thanks for your help everyone.       **tl;dr**: Boyfriend was serious when he requested I pay him a rental fee for his car. We broke up.

We have a surplus of candles that he completely ignored. Can/should I forgive him for this? If so, how?* A few people have PM'd me in recent days asking for an update so here it goes.  My original post was the day before Thanksgiving. Eugene and I had planned to spend Thanksgiving with my parents but that did not end up happening.  On my way home from work, I stopped at a local craft store to pick up supplies to make a new memorial candle for Carrie. Thank you /u/70ms for the amazing, heartfelt suggestion. My parents and I spend a day remembering Carrie and making a new candle using some of the wax from the original candle. I also ended up purchasing a locket and having some of the remaining wax from the candle put inside and the locket welded shut by a friend.  On the evening of my post, I got home and Eugene said he wanted to talk. I agreed we needed to clear the air before Thanksgiving so we sat in the living room and started to talk. I was not ready for what he told me. A few commentors from my original post seemed to hit the nail on the head in a way. Eugene told me that when we first met, he was extremely turned on by the fact that I was essentially a damsel in distress. I just lost my sister recently, I was in a massive depression, I wasn't myself. And that turned him on both sexually and in a ""protective"" way.  Over the past few months, I've started to become more myself. I got promoted at my job, I've joined a cooking class and have gotten out more, and I've definitely moved away from being a damsel in distress in the eyes of Eugene.  He went on to explain that he burned the candle in hopes that it would throw me back into that phase because that is the only time he felt he was attracted to me. That's right, he is not attracted to me unless I'm upset, crying, and a damsel in distress. When I prodded for more information, he told me that every one prior to me that he had dated had either just experienced a loss or was ""in need of rescuing"".  Eugene told me he was no longer attracted to me. He dreaded having sex with me because he could no longer be the ""hero"" that was rescuing me which is what turned him on in the first place. He didn't like go in public with me because I had started to put myself together more (like not just wearing a t-shirt and jeans like I did when depressed) and that attracted the stares of other men that he saw as a threat (taking away his damsel in distress). Eugene had a whole laundry list of things he hated doing now because I wasn't in a funk anymore. I told him if that was the case then we needed to break up. He agreed and said he would go stay with a friend until he could make new living arrangements. My name is the only one on our house and I told him I would give him 60 days to vacate the house which he agreed was fair.  Over the past few weeks, I've spent a lot of time with my parents and with close friends. I don't really feel like I've been dumped, or broke up with someone. I just feel like me.  Carrie's candle sits on my desk where the original was and I wear the locket every day. Thank you Reddit for listening. I appreciate it more than you know.        **tl;dr**: Ex only likes damsels in distress. We broke up. I'm happy.","This guy is completely off his rockers. As much as the candle meant to you, it was a price to pay if it helped you get away from this creep. Your sister was protecting you with this candle even after she passed away. Make sure that he doesn't develop stalkerish or obsessive tendencies. I would count the days and try to make him leave asap. ",4331
3y20qs,"**Edit: Thanks for the gold!** [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3smtqa/my_gf_30f_overheard_my_35m_family_talking_badly/) found here.  A few people have messages me for an update, so I thought would post. First, thank you for all the kind words and great ideas. It really helped me get some perspective on the situation. First off, Sammy and I had a wonderful Thanksgiving. We spent  it out of town in a small skiing town. It was a great weekend and we spent a lot of time talking and discussing what to do about my family. Sammy was still pretty hurt over the matter but was adamant that I shouldn't cut all ties with my family.  I told her that all depended on my family. My mom was in denial that I wouldn't be coming to Thanksgiving. After my last post, I let her know Sammy and I wouldn't be attending. She brushed it off until the day before Thanksgiving when she called to make sure I was bringing pie. I reminded her I wouldn't be at dinner and she broke down crying. She told me she was sorry for hurting Sammy and would like the chance to apologize. I let her know she'd have a chance after Thanksgiving.  After we got back from our Thanksgiving trip, my parents came over for dinner. I had okay'd this with Sammy. She thought my parents deserved a chance to make this right and frankly, I think she really wanted to mend things with my family. Dinner was, awkward, to say the least. My dad started out by offering Sammy a genuine apology. He told her he was extremely embarrassed and genuinely wanted to make things up to her. They had a nice chat. The talk with my mom, well, that went okay. My mom cried through most of it and tried to reinforce that she was very sorry. I couldn't tell if she was sorry or just upset that I was taking Sammy's side. I don't think Sammy was convinced either. A few days after dinner, my mom called Sammy and asked her to lunch to talk by themselves. Several comments in my last post mentioned that my family probably felt Sammy was annoying simply because they felt intimidated  or projecting their own issues on her. I think that was spot on. Sammy went to lunch with my mom they had a very long, good talk about everything. She said my mom felt jealous that Sammy was so educated and had the chance to get an education. And Sammy admitted to being jealous that my mom has a big family. Sammy opened up to my mom about the situation with her own family and living on her own since she was a teenager. I think that hit my mom very hard because she's always been surrounded by a big, loving family. And, I think she was horrified by her own behavior towards Sammy, who wanted to be a part of the family. Overall, I think things are better between my parents and Sammy.  My younger sister reached out to Sammy after Thanksgiving. I don't think any of my siblings expected me to ditch family dinner and I heard they were pretty upset I went on vacation instead. My sister apologized over the phone. I don't know if it was enough, but it was a good step. Sammy says she's feeling pretty neutral about my youngest sister. She said she feels like my sister is more sorry she was caught, but Sammy appreciated the apology. My brother had to endure a very uncomfortable few weeks at work, while Sammy was traveling. I think by Thanksgiving, he was confident that Sammy wasn't going to screw with his job. When Sammy got back to work after our vacation, he went to her office to apologize. Again, I think he apologized just to appease us. But, he did it in person and didn't try to cop out. Like my sister, Sammy feels neutral about him. My other sister (my brother's twin) is the only hold out. She hasn't given Sammy an apology and seems pissed that she no longer has a built in free babysitter. She's doubled down and said she has nothing to apologize for and Sammy is the one causing troubles. This has caused a bit of a rift in my family. My parents would like Sammy and I to come to Christmas dinner, but I'm not interested in being around my sister right now and I'm not going to subject Sammy to that. My parents have even suggested that my sister should stay home to make us more comfortable in coming. While I appreciate the sentiment, I would feel guilty about my sister being alone on Christmas (her kids will be with their dad). Sammy and I have plenty of offers from friends, my sister would probably not be able to find a place to go on short notice. Sammy has told my parents she would rather not create a bigger rift and we'll come over at another time. Sammy told me, privately, that while she has forgiven my family, she's not all the comfortable hanging out with my family just yet. I'm perfectly okay with this, I feel like taking some time from my family will be a good thing. Sammy and I are still deciding where to go on Christmas, probably to my best friend's house. The best part of the update: My best friend's wife went ring shopping with me. She let me go to all the chain stores and balked at the prices for the same ring in every store. She eventually took me to a local jeweler and we discussed a custom ring. The jeweler completely understood what I wanted and I decided she would be great at designing a ring. She's pretty backed up with orders, and said she'd be able to get to it in January. A few nights ago, she texted me a picture of a stone she had found, to see if it fit what I had in mind. Sammy saw the text and it led to an impromptu proposal. She said yes! So, now I have a fiance! We haven't really told anyone yet. I'll tell my family at some point. But for now, I'm enjoying sharing this time with her.  So, things are okay. Better than I hoped since my last post. I'm very sad about my sister because I miss her and her kids. And I miss my family. But, I feel good about my decisions. I feel like things will get better with my family, except my sister, in time. Sammy liked the idea of a destination wedding next summer, but we haven't even started any planning yet. Sammy told me after everything that's happened with my family, she feels confident that I have her back and that she finally has me as her true family. TL;DR Parents, brother and sister apologized and tried to make things right. Other sister is holding fast in her assholishness. Proposed and now I have a fiance. ","Very nice, congrats. Though I'm appalled that the one who should have been her supporter is the one hold out.  You sister trusts her to baby sit but talks shit on her and won't apologize?  Messed up.",573
3yj0un,"My fiance dated a guy before me that she was incredibly in love with. I knew she was into him, but they dated for 2 years, and we have been together for 4 years. He ended it because he wasn't ready for commitment, according to her. We've been engaged since July, with the wedding set for next September. Over the Christmas holidays she told me that since we are getting married, we need to be open and honest with each other, which I have been about my whole life, and I thought she had. Come to find out she considers her ex to be soulmate and if he asked, she would go back. She said this is normal for most couples to have an arrangement like this, and that he may never say anything. If that is the case, she loves me and wants a life and a family with me. I got upset and said why are you with me then, and she told me to calm down, that everyone settles. She said she will always love me, but this is just the way things are. I've been avoiding her for days now. I am incredibly hurt, I thought she wanted to spend her life with me, but now it is with an asterisks.  Am I overreacting, like she says? Is it normal for people to have this type of situation?      **tl;dr**: Fiance said she is soulmates with her ex and would leave me if he asked, said this is normal for most couples.","Its not normal for an SO to say she will leave over the idea of a soulmate. Basically, shes warned you that if she can do better than you she will drop you immediately.

3zyuk1,"First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3yqi3k/my_31f_husband_33m_of_4_years_has_a_weird/ tl;dr: Husband has spent a lot of time and money helping his pregnant coworker. This makes me uncomfortable, but he says I am being greedy for trying to discourage him from doing a good deed. Am I worrying over nothing, or are my concerns justified? *** Since many of you asked for an update, and you were kind enough to offer advice, I have decided to give one.  The first thing I did after making my initial post was to confront my husband directly again. I asked him point blank if he was so involved with Kelsey's pregnancy because he was the father of her child. He denied it. I then asked him to introduce me to Kelsey since he had given her money that belonged to both of us. When I mentioned this, he got very defensive and accused me of being insecure. I responded by saying that I at least had a right to know the person I was helping and that he shouldn't have a problem with me meeting Kelsey if nothing was going on between them. He then told me that he wasn't going to introduce us and that I needed to work on my jealousy issues.  I decided to contact Kelsey the next day. I found her, or at least the woman I thought was her, through a mutual friend's Facebook page. I sent her a message telling her who I was. I explained to her why I was concerned about her relationship with my husband and requested that she please let me know if she was having my husband's baby.  She sent me a very nasty message back. I will spare you many of the details. The basic gist was that I was old and unattractive and unable to satisfy my husband, so he found someone better (i.e., Kelsey). Among other things, she claimed that the baby was my husband's and that he was planning to leave me but felt sorry for me and couldn't bring himself to do it. She ended the message by telling me that I should let him go so they could be together. It hurt a lot to read that message. It still hurts me to think about it.  I confronted my husband that same night. I showed him the message. He got really quiet and admitted that she was telling the truth but denied telling her all of the horrible things she said about me. He said it (getting her pregnant) was a mistake and he was only trying to do the right thing by her and the baby. He denied that they were still sleeping together and said he wanted to stay with me and have a baby with me. I have no idea if either of these things are true.   I'm not sure what I'm going to do. Everything has happened so fast. A couple of days have passed now, and I'm still thinking things over. He wants us to go to counseling to try to work through this, but I don't think I'm interested in working on our marriage. It would be hard for me to get past this if he had cheated, but the fact that he may be having a child with this woman makes it harder. If I stay with him, she's always going to be in our lives. I have thought about waiting until we can do a paternity test to make a final decision, but I don't know if I want to do that either. It may be easier if I just make the change now. I have started looking for divorce attorneys. Most of my family and friends have told me I need to get out of this marriage, and each day I get closer to making that move. I just need a bit more time before I'm ready to make a decision.        **tl;dr**: It's my husband's baby. He wants me back and to work on our marriage, but most likely we'll be getting divorced. ","Don't go back to him. You deserve so much better. He was willing to hide it, he's only sorry that he got caught.",3580

Parents are homophobic and he's still in the closet. Should I tell him? And if so, how? ______________ So about a month ago I made a post about how I caught my brother having sex with his best friend and I wanted advice on how to approach him. One redditor suggested I write my brother a letter, so that's exactly what I did. I could have let it go, but I didn't want my brother to become a statistic and feel isolated. In my letter I essentially told me brother that I had seen him and Friend together. I told him that he doesn't have to tell me anything, but I love him and he can talk to me about anything and I'd never tell our parents. He never responded straight forward. We talked like normal, and whenever Friend came over I just kept my distance. But on New Years Eve, him and Friend and I went out to a party (no family was around). He and Friend kissed at midnight, and I've never seen him so happy.  This was a really uneventful update but I thought I'd post it anyway. tl;dr: Wrote brother a letter, he seemed to get a little more comfortable around me. Things are going good.",You are a great brother. You did a great thing.,1578
40n7s0,"Edit: Whoops, forgot to link the [OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xe0ma/my29f_husband33m_is_an_overgrown_child_and_i/)!  A few things first, I just wanna thank everyone who commented on my OP. I got overwhelmed with the amount of responses while on mobile (had no computer when I posted), and stopped replying, but I read every single comment and story. I've received a few PMs asking for an update and I'm sorry it's so late!  This update would be extremely long if I typed every single detail (and still is kinda long, whoops), so I'm gonna try and condense it.   So, I sat my husband down the night he got home from work after posting my OP and we had a loooong talk. Again, this would be incredibly long if I wrote all the details so I'm gonna summarize and go in the order of my points I made in my OP. Keep in mind, our talk didn't follow the order of my post, so I'm sorry if anything seems confusing, since it would have been discussed out of order:  On not knowing when to pause playtime - I told him that I know he loves playing with the kids, and I love that he loves playing with the kids, but that I really need him to work with me during bedtime. I also once again pointed out that their lack of sleep is making them grumpy and harder to manage in the mornings, and that they're growing and need their sleep. He's had a couple slip-ups since, but he's cooled it down around bedtime now and makes more of an effort to help me with bedtime. He's started reading to them instead (I used to to it) and is 20 times better than me at it because they love the funny voices he gives the characters.  On discipline - I told him its not fair of him to constantly make me feel like the bad guy. And that no parent LIKES disciplining their kids, but they need it to learn and grow into good adults, and that I need him to be united with me on punishments. He's having a little trouble with this one, but has been trying more. Which I appreciate.  On breaking their toys - I, again, told him that I know he loves playing with our kids, but he needs to stop destroying their things. That not only is it upsetting them, but it's causing us to needlessly spending extra money to replace things that we don't need to be. I took this part of the talk to suggest we finally get a full sized trampoline like we had been talking about for a little while, and that he should dig out his bike from the garage so he can ride with our daughter when she learns. We're both probably more excited about the trampoline than the kids lol. We talked more about this topic, but these are the most relevant points. He realized he goes a little too far after I described the scene I wrote about in my OP, with him riding around on their little cars while the kids are standing on the sidelines. I'm also happy to report he has stayed off our daughters new bike.  On making the kids play when they don't want to - He agreed that it wasn't cool of him to push just because HE wants to play. I told him our kids are people, and just because they're kids, doesn't mean they don't deserve to have their boundaries respected or time to themselves.  And now on to the best friend thing - This was the first thing we discussed. Long story short, he was feeling hurt and generally having a little trouble accepting our daughter was growing up. This is really the first big thing shes done or said to show that she is, in fact, growing up. And he just wasn't expecting it and handling it very poorly, which he knew he did. I took a line from a comment on my OP and told him our children will have lots of best friends in their lifetime, but he will always be their only dad. This visibly comforted him, so thank you to whoever it was who wrote that. I took a suggestion from someone on the OP, and suggested that he call up his own parents and ask them for advice on how they handed watching 4 kids grow up and leave the nest. He really liked this idea and has since done so. I also showed him stories commenters on my OP shared about their relationship with their parents growing up. I told him that I'm not showing him them because I think he's going to become like those parents, but that I think it's important he see the children's side of things. These stories hit him pretty hard, which led into this:  So, I left something out of my OP that I didn't realize was relevant. Lots of people asked how my husbands relationship with his parents was growing up, and I answered that it was great. However, my own relationship with my parents was horrible. Long story short, I don't get along with nor even like my parents, and I see/talk to them maybe once a year. Growing up was miserable, to say the least. And it affected me for quite a long time where I was a huge ball of anger and resentment because of the way my parents treated me. I told my husband about all of this a few months after we started dating, so he was aware of everything from the start.  My husband told me he told himself he would be the best dad he could be, because he wanted our kids to have the childhood he knew I wanted, and wanted for them. Now, I started crying here and was a bit of a mess for a few minutes lol. It was honestly one of the most touching things anyone has ever said to me. I told him he *is* the best dad, and that I love him so much for it. Finding out that this was essentially the root of everything, it was a lot easier to continue on with the rest of my points.  Everything has been great since. He really listened to what I was saying this time, and has made a big effort to help me out more while also cooling it a bit with the kids. Him and our daughter have been riding around on their bikes together every weekend. I've also started learning how to ride so I can eventually join. Again, I wanna thank everyone for commenting on my OP and helping me gather my thoughts. I thought a few things said about my husband were a bit extreme, but I realize that's something that happens when people give advice on a situation they only have so much info on.      **tl;dr**: Talked to husband. He's great. Made me cry. All is well.","I love that three of the top four comments in the last thread mentioned couples counseling, psychiatric evaluation, and divorce.

41fvu4,"**Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ub78m/my_25f_boyfriends_27m_best_friend_27m_cheated_on/** I was initially going to see my Sami just a few days after I found out what happened, but canceled on him. I took the weekend to think, talk to a few friends & read over the comments to my original post. After a bit of thinking, I decided to break up with him. Sami lied to me, lied to our mutual friend Lauren, covered up for cheating, and knew full well that his friend Jon was having sex with multiple girls and doing it ""raw"". He basically decided his friendship with a cheater was more important than Lauren being exposed to STDs. That was the deal breaker. I called Sami on Tuesday and asked him to meet up with me in a public place. When we got there, I told him what Lauren had told me. He initially denied, denied, denied. But I think he could see from the look on my face that I wasn't about to be fooled. He literally looked me in the eyes and said, ""To be honest, wouldn't it be worse if I was the kind of pussy who didn't cover for his friends? Don't you want a man who is loyal?"" God help me, I was upset talking to him but he said that I burst out laughing. What he was saying was just so ridiculous but he said it as though he was a martyr. I stopped laughing after a second but the look on his face changed completely. He leaned in and said ""You stupid bitch, you think Jon was the only one fucking around?"" He's never cussed at me before or said anything with so much anger, especially not with the intent to hurt me, but for some reason I just didn't care. I thought so little of him at that moment that his opinion didn't matter to me. It was actually kind of a comfort that he said that to me because it proves that he's a fuckboy. ""When people show you who they are, believe them."" So I just got up and left. I picked up Chipotle then went home and watched ""Making a Murderer"". A few hours later I called Lauren and explained to her everything that happened. She comforted me then advised me to get tested for STDs immediately. She ended up coming with me for support to get tested and then a week later I got the results that I'm clean (and so is Lauren btw). And that was that. **tl;dr - My boyfriend who was helping his best friend cheat ended up being a cheater too. Both relationships are now ruined, but the two girls ended up becoming even better friends.** ","\> ""don't you want a man who's loyal?"" \> cheated on his girlfriend That's actually amazing. ",2650
42atwk,"I'm very into kinky BDSM sexual stuff and really enjoy it. My boyfriend wasn't into it at first but he was open to it and now he's also like me, very much interested. I have turned the basement of my house into a BDSM dungeon with a lot of equipments, latex outfits, cuffs, chains, spreaders, bondage equipment, swings, dildos, strap-ons, benches, etc. My boyfriends mom is visiting from the other side of the country and is staying with us for a few days. This is fine. She's been wanting to visit his son and get to know me better and I think it's lovely. She is a rather devout Christian and believes in things like modesty, traditional gender roles and even abstinence before marriage. I don't have a problem with her if that's how she wants to live her life. It's not for someone like me who's basically the opposite of those things.  I always lock the door to the basement. It's a private room and I don't think it's unreasonable to lock one of your rooms when you have guests. It should be clear that a locked room is supposed to be left alone. Apparently she does not understand this. Yesterday she asked where door leads to and I told her that it's the basement and it's just full of stuff and it's always locked because I don't want my niece and nephew who visit often go down there (not a lie, it is the truth). This morning I went out for a run when she was still sleeping. My boyfriend has a night shift at the hospital so he was away. When I came back I noticed that she has broken into the basement (took the key from the drawer in my room) and she asked me to ""answer for this"". I didn't, just kept asking her why is she down here and how she got here and she explained that she thinks I was disrespectful for locking a room to a guest and she had to find out what I'm hiding down there because she thought it could be something illegal but instead she found, as she called it, ""evil material of a shameless slut"". She then went on a rant about how ungodly these things are, that I have corrupted her son, how I'm of the devil and going to hell and she's not going to allow me to take her son with her, and things like that. I just asked her to get out of the basement, stay in her room until his son arrives and she can deal with him as I don't think I need to justify my lifestyle or my belongings to her. She called me a whore and went out of the house. That was 30 minutes ago. I texted my boyfriend and he hasn't responded yet. Not sure what I should do now. I really don't want her in my house ever again.     **tl;dr**: Boyfriend's holier-than-thou Christian mother found my broke into my room and dungeon, then called me a slot and whore for having sex toys that she disapproves.","This woman doesn't respect you or your property and I wouldn't let her stay in your home anymore. Honestly, I'd make it clear to your boyfriend that his mom completely ruined any relationship she has with you at this point and that if she doesn't respect you, then she can find someplace else to stay, but you aren't letting her stay or even visit your home again.

43gwdk,"Update from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42vdem/me_29f_with_my_vegan_coworker_29f_i_dont_know_how/ So the meeting happened on Friday. HR lady was a very much a ""let's all get along"" type and very enthusiastic and eager to mediate with buzzwords and talk about feelings. HR contacted me and I told them to get Vegan's perspective first so that she wouldn't complain not getting a chance to get her point of view.  So Vegan, boss and HR had a meeting. I'm pretty sure Vegan made it seem like she had been bullied which was pretty much what I was expecting. Then the rest of us were called into a meeting with HR to give our points of view. The coworker who was a cancer survivor had gotten progressively more annoyed at what happened after the meeting with Vegan taking off so I told her she was welcome to take the lead in the meeting because her issues could have had an actual health impact.  She took up most of the time actually talking about how Vegan kept giving her unsolicited, medically unsubstantiated advice on cancer treatment and prevention and HR and boss started looking uncomfortable and concerned. A few other coworkers- like the one with coeliac especially also mentioned unsolicited advice. The my Peruvian coworker brought up cultural insensitivity and the eating your pets comment and I didn't know Vegan said this to the Hindu coworker but apparently Vegan had told Hindu that veganism would make him a better Hindu because it eliminated all animal cruelty or something. A few people started laughing at this and one coworker joked that Vegan was like the vegan Amway- always selling something that nobody was interested in. So I'd been pretty quiet at that point and HR asked me, why I had asked Vegan to only speak about work related matters and I told her that I'm a hunter and briefly explained that I believe in ethical hunting and how it befitted endangered species etc. But Vegan kept on calling it murder, had a dig at me for my leather skirt even though other people here had leather shoes, leather handbag and HR injected that her Filofax was real leather and I told her the talking to Vegan was stressful and demoralizing and she'd refused to respect my boundaries when I asked her on other occasions to keep things work related. So then the ""mediation"" begun and Vegan was brought in and other coworkers left. I basically said exactly what I'd said before to Vegan with HR and boss there, that I respected her lifestyle choice and how passionate she was about making a change but I disagreed with her on certain pointed and even if she didn't agree with my lifestyle choices, it was unfair of her to single me out or harass me about them. Vegan said that to her, what I was doing was morally unconscionable and she didn't believe in exploiting animals. I told her that her iPhone, her clothes, her computer were all produced via human exploitation and the quinoa that she loves so much has affected local income farmers in Bolivia but.. and then I qualified I told her it was great that she had her thing to try and improve the world but I also had a different perspective and different issues I was more passionate about and that I had respected her point of view and she should respect mine.  Vegan's response to all of this was ""it's still murder"". HR looked annoyed at this point and said that Vegan was not trying to find a middle ground. So I turned to HR and said that this was why there was no middle ground and that's why I thought keeping things civil and work related because in the end we are here to do a job. HR agreed, boss agreed, I agreed, Vegan grudgingly agreed and HR wrote all this down and I had mediation meeting minutes saying all of this emailed to the 4 of us. Anyway, boss called us into a meeting around lunch and said it was a good that we were able to talk about things outside of work because it's good team bonding but ""it had come to his attention"" that there was unsolicited health advice and cultural sensitivity issues in the team we'd be discussing that in our next team meeting and we'd had a productive session but needed to focus on work and keep our spirits up.  Vegan had a meeting with boss after that and then went home early. We had to come in on a Saturday and today end of month stuff (this happens when the end of month falls on a weekend- I'm in finance) but we get time in lieu. I just gave Vegan a cheerful good morning to which she didn't respond and when she said handed me a file and said she was leaving, I just said thank you for your work today and enjoy the rest of your weekend. Vegan kind of just grunted at me and left. I'm just going to keep it civil like HR said and Vegan and dig her own hole. I still feel a bit sorry for her, I still think she feels attacked but at least it got her off my back for the time being.  TLDR: Vegan was told formally by boss and HR to keep things work related and civil.","Her behavior has nothing to do with being vegan, and 100% to do with being an obtuse bitch. You handled this really well. ",1259
43wk5m,"UPDATE to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43pba4/my_23f_boyfriend_28m_of_8_years_says_im_abusive/) post. **TL;DR; from first post:** Toxic relationship becoming too much for me to handle, and I'm confused about my role in it. Am I a horrible person? What do I do?  I'm sorry for leaving you guys hanging yesterday. I was trying to be vague in the last post because I know my boyfriend had mentioned in passing that he kept an eye on this sub in case I ever posted, but I didn't realize he meant that he checked at every single break. He was able to find it anyway so now it doesn't matter.  **I'm okay, just to get that out of the way! First of all, wow.... you guys, thank you so much. I haven't read all the comments yet because I had no idea this would get so big, but thank you.. you are all such wonderful people. To everyone who offered me a place to stay or a ride, I can't thank you enough... Just knowing that there are people out there who would help a complete stranger is very touching and I wish  I could tell you how much I appreciate every single one of you... thank you.** To those of you saying I'm abusive for posting this, hell, I didn't mean it that way, but maybe? I didn't plan for or want him to see it but I can see what you mean.   Anyway, last night was probably the biggest night of my life so bear with me if it starts getting too long. I've been in therapy for the last three years and one of the things my therapist had me do was get a backpack ready with everything I might need in an emergency. Within two minutes of receiving his text yesterday and posting the edit I grabbed that backpack and was planning on just walking so at least I wasn't home(I don't have a car) I was thinking about just going through my contacts and talking to who ever I could but that didn't work out. Josh was outside parked down the street!! He was trying to catch me leaving! So when he sent the text that said “saw your post I'm coming home” he was **ALREADY** home. He was fucking waiting. I just stood there cause I didn't know what to do, I thought he was going to be furious but he ran up to me with a completely different react than I expected... he was crying, like balling his eyes out. I still felt like I was waiting for him to get mad or scream at me or something but he just hugged me really tight and said he's so sorry. He said he had no idea I felt that way and that he knows he has jealousy issues and a temper and asked if we could talk about it inside. He begged me to come in and said he couldn't lose me and he loves me. I didn't know what to do, I just followed him in. He took my backpack from me and when he looked at it he just broke down. He asked if I was really leaving him, why I didn't tell him things were this bad, why I never talk to him.... I told him I can't talk to him. Every time I have ever decided to trust him and open up about even the tiniest thing that's bothered me (like him asking for other girls' numbers in front of me or him hanging up on me constantly) he always loses his shit and starts screaming at the top of his lungs while I just sit there as quiet as possible and apologize. And then this is where he changed, at this point he was no longer acting like he was sorry, he'd switched to “you're full of shit, I treat you like a goddamn angel and get walked all over in return.” He said he should never have to apologize to me. I was very upset so I played one of the fights I recorded and I'm so glad I kept those after he told me to delete them... Even in the first three minutes of it you can tell I was being calm, the first thing I say is “baby, I didn't mean to say anything was wrong with us, I just wanted to know why you don't want me to apply at [place I could use my degree]. I just want to help make money.” He immediately starts yelling “you'll cheat on me and find someone better! Fuck off, go find some guy to fuck at [place]. I don't give a fuck you'll come crawling back to me, no one else would put up with you! FUCK YOU!” This fight was pretty recent but he only listened to a few seconds of it.  (I know some people who commented on the last post suggested that maybe I really am screaming back at him – someone said something about slapping him too, neither of us have ever slapped the other though – and I understand that may be something to consider. But I know that I don't yell. I have a hard time standing up for myself and I hate confrontation, especially with him. I always just want to make the fights better. I know I need to work on that, and I've brought it up in therapy before, but I just felt like adding that)  He got up and said “fuck off with that shit.”  He was definitely not apologetic and sweet anymore so I was just quiet. He said he's done with this shit and I have no right to record him and then he ripped the phone out of my hand. He said more stuff but I can't remember everything. I asked what he was doing, but he just glared at me and then he stomped outside with it and then threw it as hard as he could. I don't know why but that just broke my heart so much, he's broken things of mine before but I had been planning on calling a friend or my brother and I didn't know any of their numbers. I asked him what he did with it but he wouldn't answer. He slammed the door so hard when he came in that I flinched, then he bumped into me really roughly and went straight to his computer where he put his headphones on and turned up his music really loud. (He always put his headphones on in a certain way when he's mad, cause then he can't hear me) He started playing a game and he was literally fuming. I stood in the door and he looked up at me and the way he looked at me was awful. I could feel that he absolutely hated me, and what's sad is that wasn't even the first time he's looked at me that way. I think I was kind of in shock, I always feel that way when he's mad. He kept playing games so I went out to look for my phone, which I found parts of shattered on the street but I never found the battery and I don't think it was usable. When I went back in I was shaking :[ We talked it out later I think everything is going to be okay.  *Just kidding.* I don't know why but I just felt so done, I grabbed his phone off the counter and ran outside. I knew he used to text my brother and he had the number of the friend I watched a movie with a while back (to make sure I was where I said I was) so I used his to call them. My brother answered on the second ring and I didn't know what to say so I just started pouring my heart out, I told him I'm sorry we haven't talked in so long, but that I'm really scared and have no where to go. Guys, this hurt more than anything my boyfriend has ever said or done and I'm still so surprised that he would have this reaction after so long...  I can't remember the beginning but the last thing he said was “you deserve everything that's happening to you” and hung up.  He hates me. He really thinks I deserve to stay with Josh because I'm attracted to girls.  At the time I just thought fuck him and I called my friend (who I'll call A). Well she didn't answer at first, but then she called right back! Thank you all so much for suggesting that I call her because she was so happy to hear from me and I told her everything that happened, she said she was 30 minutes away and she would come with her husband (I didn't even know she had gotten married! :[ ) so I went back in and oh my god that was a horrible 30 minutes. I didn't what to do I was so fucking worried he'd come out because I didn't want to see him (I'm a bad liar and he'd know something was up) . I didn't want him to notice my stuff all packed up so I just put all my cords/controllers/clothes and small things I couldn't live without in a box but left the big stuff. A got there really fast and her husband (who is such a nice guy) helped me load my desk/chair and computer in their truck. This is the part I'm not feeling so great about right now. I left without saying a word to Josh.  I could still hear him playing games in the other room and the only thing I wanted in the entire world was for him to hug me and tell me it was okay and …wow my heart really hurts today, I can't even see through the tears to type this out.. I know how he sounded but I really loved him so much and it feels like I ripped my own limb off... When I think about his face and smile and everything that was good I feel like there's a huge hole in my chest.  But when I play these fights I recorded, and think about my future and this amazing friend who came and saved me and everything I can do with my life... I feel so happy. I thought I needed Josh, but man.. it's so amazing feeling like I don't. I have to get a new phone, though :[ Thank you all so much, you are all amazing people. I received so many thoughtful messages and I can't tell you how thankful I am that I ended up posting here. I'm with A now, and she lives in a house I've never been to so I'm pretty sure Josh won't find it. And she invited another girl I haven't seen in years to go to a concert on friday night and I am so excited! We had strawberry daiquiris and watched stupid horror movies all night and her husband is making waffles right now!   Guys... I'm free. I'm so fucking happy. I'M FUCKING FREE!!  Fuck you, Josh. Eat a dick. **TL;DR;** Left a very unhealthy relationship and I'm on a roller coaster of emotions. Thank you, Reddit.  What do I do now? P.S. Sorry for the length - ^said^no^guy^ever  **Edit:** Something I forgot to add is that A's husband (who is a software developer) noticed something on my computer when I turned it back on at their house to show them the post. It's called SniperSpy and that is how Josh knew about my post. I thought he'd just been super-stalking r/relationships, but nope. He installed a spy app on my pc. I know it shouldn't take a software developer to notice an icon on my desktop, but I never saw it before so I think it must've popped back up when I restarted my computer. Just a warning to those out there who value their privacy, I didn't realize it was possible to spy on someone like that.","Since Joshy boy might be reading this...   EAT A BAG OF DICKS, JOSH.",2069
445fph,"And edit 3 (I forgot to type this as I was just going to bed): The whole reason I came here was to know how to respond to our acquaintances when they approach me about it being so great Mark came out. This is basically going to be my go to response: ""I'm happy that Mark finally had the courage to live true to himself, but divorces are always sad and unfortunately ours is no different.""  Edit 2: just realized I could edit after the lock. This is my first gold...thank you so much...this has been amazing at the all the support I've gotten. I don't even know how many private messages I've gotten since the lock and how many people have gone through this or had relatives to through this.  Things will be static for a while but when there is news I will post an update. Right now I'm going to go hug my kids because even with all the crap, I never would have had them without Mark in my life and they are my two favorite people in the world. Thank you again.  I hope this doesn't get too long, I'm sorry in advance, there are lots of emotions here.  Mark and I met in college and had a really great relationship. We dated until both of us finished law school after which he proposed and I gladly said yes. At the time he was much more religious than I was and he insisted we have kids right away and that I stay at home with them to raise them while he worked. I had really wanted to start my practice as well but I could see it was really important to him so I relented and we had two amazing kids and his law career really took off. I was able to work from home and hire help three times a week (with me still in the house) to do insurance and real estate paperwork reviews--it was something but I had really wanted to be a litigator. I was even ok with this and my resentment didn't ever really show unless Mark would remind me that stay at home moms should be stay at home moms and not work at all.  Marriage turned really bad after our second child was born 8 years ago.  We basically became like unfriendly roommates. I pleaded with Mark to go to counseling with me and he would and things would get better for a few months then it would go to crap, I would insist on divorce but then he would remind me that our (his actually) religion does not allow divorce so I would insist on counseling--and the cycle repeated itself more times than I can count.  Then about a year ago Mark hit me with the bombshell revelation that he has been gay since he was a teenager. I was honestly relieved for him because it seemed to explain so much of why he acted the way he did, why he was distant and over compensating with so much. I was actually very relieved that our divorce would finally come and he could live true to himself.  He moved out, but it turns out he had been having an affair with his much younger partner for about 5 years (the dates on this are VERY sketchy btw because it's very possible this ""man"" was underage when he and Mark started the affair--he certainly was when he and Mark met). I grew very resentful that I was busy working my fingers to the bone to save the marriage to appease Mark's religious sentiment while he was off having sex, technically cheating on me and violating the principles of the religion only he really cared about.  Our kids are also of the age that I could have easily gone back to work but again I stayed at home to appease his desire to appear as the perfect Christian couple--all the while he is carrying on with a younger lover.  Mark has also fought me at every turn over the divorce. He doesn't want to pay any alimony even though it would take me years to get my career to where I could support even half the lifestyle the kids and I lead now. He wants to pay bare bones child support and wants the image that we split custody but in reality he makes the effort to see the kids once every couple of months and ignores their calls. He's a great lawyer so even he has to know all he is doing is delaying the inevitable to make things hard on me. In all this time, he's taking sabbaticals from his firm and taking long vacations to places like Tavarua with his boyfriend delaying our divorce even further.  It happens almost daily, and certainly weekly where family and friends will see me at dinners, the grocery store or restaurants (we live in old farm community that has essentially been turned into a commuter town for the city near by but it retains a very small town feel) and tell me how amazing they thing Mark is for ""living true to himself"" and being so courageous to finally come out. I've gone along with this because I don't want to embarrass either of us. But yesterday I was approached by an older woman from our (old now-thank god) Church who almost ""shamed"" me for keeping Mark in a relationship that he didn't want to be in.  I didn't snap but its as close as I've come. The only people that really know how I feel are my best friend, my Mom and my counselor.  Is it time that I just start telling the truth when I have one of these awkward interactions? I feel that if Mark had left me for a younger woman he'd been seeing for 5 years, everyone WOULD be expecting me to spill the beans on what a jerk he was.       **tl;dr**: my husband came out as gay. He'd been having an affair for 5 years while we struggled to keep marriage together. He's now being awful in the divorce but our ""community"" wants me to play along and be supportive of his decision.  Edit: this totally blew up as I was taking kids to school! Wow thank you everyone. Lots of people asking the same questions which I should have clarified in the beginning...sorry about that! 1. I have a really great lawyer as of January and he's working on it. Mark did every shitty divorce trick in the book to frustrate me into settling. It took that long for me to be able to even hire a lawyer in our area. I'm lucky in that I could represent myself in preliminary hearings which in turn allowed a judge nullify quite a bit of the crappy stuff Mark has done legally. Now that I'm going through it first hand, I am absolutely going to go into divorce when I do finally work. I've always heard, but I'm appalled at how the dirty tricks can affect people's lives.  2. I'm not out to ruin him...which is thus far why I haven't spread the talk of his affair. I don't think most people know that he cheated on me...and even if they do...they seem to be more impressed with his coming out. I rationalize that ruining him is not in my kids or my best interest.  3. Lots of great tips and I really appreciate every comment...this was way bigger than I thought and I'm reading all of them. Thank you. ","I'm a gay man myself and that's great for him that he came out BUT... He ruined a large portion of your life. He took up your time, your career, your emotional investments. He did all that for what? Because he was too scared to face the truth. YOU ARE JUSTIFIED IN BEING FURIOUS. If my partner came out and told me he was actually straight after building his career while I stayed at home and put my career on hold to help raise our family...The amount of walls and punching bags I would want to go through. Then to turn it around in court and not make right in how he wronged you. I honestly don't know how you haven't told people just what exactly he took from you. If he isn't there for the kids, the kids will figure it out regardless of the custody battle. Coming out doesn't make you a good parent. You were there for them and still are.  You owe it to yourself to fight hard in the custody battle. You owe it to yourself to move on. You owe it to yourself to set the record straight when people praise him for being happy while you are left in the dust. All those years he knew he was lying and he has no respect for you. Pisses me off just reading about your situation. He's an ungrateful fuck. Someone call Karma and tell her she's hit the jackpot. ",4118
44il61,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/434ot4/i_25m_won_2_tickets_to_the_super_bowl_my/ Thanks everyone for the advice. It was very helpful. This was a very stressful and long few days. I'm just glad there seems to be a resolution. I had tried talking to my girlfriend and she was still clearly upset. I approached the conversation as many people said keeping an understanding that she was more disappointed than controlling and would come around. Unfortunately she was being unreasonable. She said ""I could go"" but that doing so would hurt her a great deal and that she would need some time to reevaluate things. I should have just ended things with her there but I was so sick of these tickets by this point that I didn't even have the heart to go even if I did decide to end things with her. As suggested by some of the comments here, I called up the radio station and asked if it was at all possible to transfer the tickets to my brother so he could go with his wife. They were totally understanding and awesome about it and said they were sorry I couldn't go but they were glad to put the tickets in my brothers name for me. I was just glad to have it behind me at that point.  I told my girlfriend what I did and that I was staying here and she said that I was ""being dramatic"" and ""immature."" She said that I transferred the tickets to my brother just so I could ""win"" the argument and look like a martyr. It was at this point I reached my breaking point. I calmly told her this relationship was over. I wasn't even mad at this point just confused that a person I thought I knew could act this way. She said she was gonna break up with me because of the way I handled this anyway so breaking up with her ""didn't matter.""  My brother immediately told me I dodged a bullet and glad that she was out of everyone's lives. My brother's wife was totally cool about me using her ticket and didn't even question it even after I'm technically taking back my gift to her. They insisted that I go with my brother and it was their idea. So now I'm the guest of my original tickets that I won. Happy to say I arrived in SF a few days ago and am having the time of my life. My girlfriend didn't unfollow me on social media and I'm posting as many pictures as I possibly can. Thanks everyone! tl;dr - Transfered tickets to my brother. Girlfriend was still petulant and we broke up. Got to go on the trip with my brother anyway. ",This sounds like she is in middle school. Don't put up with her games and go to the Superbowl with your brother and have a dam good time.,1172
44xv3j,"I've lived in this apartment complex since I moved out of my parents house when I was 18. I love this building, love my home, and I've never had a problem with any of the other tenants.  A new family just moved into the apartment next to mine. At first, everything was fine. Their son was a little noisier than I'd like, but it's just something to get used to. About two weeks ago, the Mom approached me and took me to the side. She told me that she liked the apartment, everything was fine, except for one thing: her son's room was next to mine, and he could very obviously hear me having sex with my boyfriend. I apologized and said I'd try to keep things a little quieter. She told me that she thinks it's for the best if I move my bedroom, or have sex somewhere else, just in case her son hears. I told her that wasn't going to happen, but I would definitely try to be more courteous about timing. Fast forward to this past week. My boyfriend (who lives with me part-time, but is a grad student on the go most of the time, so we don't always see each other) was over, and we ended up having sex. It was probably 4 in the afternoon. While we're going at it, there's a knock on the door. I'm not expecting anyone, so we ignore it, and the knocking continues. Then comes the shouting. I need to stop, I'm being disgusting, don't I know there's a child in the next apartment, I'm a degenerate, I'm a slut, I'm a hooker, etc etc etc. She went away eventually, but not after yelling some more. Now, I don't know. Am I being unreasonable about this? I don't think it's fair for me to have to adhere to someone else's schedule just because their son shares a wall with me. We aren't screaming banshees and slapping the headboard against the wall, but we're two adults doing what we love doing.  The woman caught me leaving for work this morning and told me that if I didn't stop ""exposing myself"" to her son, she would have me arrested for child endangerment. No idea if that's even a thing.  What am I to do here? **TL/DR:** Woman thinks I am the devil because her son shares a wall with me, and he can hear me and my boyfriend having sex. I'm not about to stop having sex in my apartment, but I would like this to stop.","Tell your landlord about this situation ASAP.  Point out that yo  have a history -- a long history -- with no complaints (I'm assuming) so far, and this neighbor is being unreasonable AND ALSO HARASSING YOU.

4518ub,"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/431j8y/my_24m_girlfriend_23f_accidentally_sent_me_a/) **tl;dr original**: My long distance gf accidentally copied and pasted a nude photo of herself into my Facebook chat. She apologized and said it was meant for me later as a surprise, but we have never exchanged photos and I don't believe her.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Thanks to everyone for their replies. It really helped put things into perspective: for example, it is way more common to take self timer nudes than I thought, and that it's possible to check the metadata for a photo and find out some details like whether or not it was taken on a self timer.   I want to especially thank /u/justtotalkaboutrelat for asking me if Christina and I had actually dated for a full year yet, or if we had an anniversary coming up. Because, as it turns out, we did (I don't know why I didn't make the connection on my own)! And, as it turns out, **my girlfriend is not cheating on me!**  A couple days ago I got a big package in the mail to celebrate our one year anniversary. Among other things, it contained an envelope filled with multiple nude photos of my wonderfully awesome girlfriend, with a note saying ""I know you never asked, but I wanted to give you something special since I can't be there with you!"" Among the photos was the one that she accidentally sent to me. She also included a USB with the photos uploaded, along with the physical copies, so that I could have digital versions.  Here are a few extra details to better explain what happened:  * Christina did indeed take the photo's herself. I asked her (nicely) how she managed to do a self timer at such a good angle, because my initial reaction to the photos were that somebody else obviously must have taken them. She showed me through Facetime how she was able to prop her phone up against some objects in her room, and they were exactly from the angle she sent them at!  * To further corroborate this story, Christina had actually confirmed my address with one of our mutual friends a few days before the accidental-copy-and-paste situation went down. So she had in mind that she wanted to send this package *before*, not as a cover-up for accidentally giving herself away  * When I asked her how she accidentally managed to send that particular nude, she said that she was copying and pasting the files from one folder to the USB she sent me. She forgot that the nude was still on her clipboard. When she tried to send me that gif, it didn't copy properly, and instead she pasted what was on her clipboard previously. She said she was just relieved that it was me she made this mistake on, and not somebody else!  * Finally, I took the advice that many of you commented/messaged me. I checked the data on the image files and they were indeed taken recently on a self timer.   So, sigh of relief! Thank you to everyone here for putting my mind at ease. I was convinced that everyone was going to say I was definitely being cheated on. But honestly, Christina has never done anything to even make me suspect that she would be cheating! I am very happy.       **tl;dr**: My girlfriend is not cheating on me! She took those nudes to send as part of a surprise package to celebrate our one year anniversary. ",It's nice to see a happy ending on here every once in a while! You lucky fucker.,1512
464jtx,"I was in a really tricky situation and was feeling doubtful about myself, and I'm so thankful all of you encouraged me to continue with my Valentine's Day plans because everything went better than expected. [Here is the original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/45hogk/my_22_m_girlfriends_21_f_dad_bought_her_a_10k/)  She got ready as usual in the morning, and hopped on over to our favorite breakfast spot. when we were done, she said something like, ""this is so thoughtful, how wonderful we get to spend this morning together. thank you, thank you"" which got me all excited because I knew she was expecting to go home afterwards, but SURPRISE! We get in the car and head further north. she was all like, ""what's happening?"" and when we stopped at ANOTHER coffee spot, she burst into laughter saying, ""oh my gosh are you serious MORE coffee? you really want to spend the day with a lunatic?"" to which i respond, OF COURSE.  and when we get to seattle she's still giddy. we live close to seattle but hardly ever get time to just walk around and enjoy seattle because it's normally business, or we're just too busy ourselves to have a leisure day. we go to little shops and look around and she loses herself in some kitchen shop for a good hour and a half (seriously). and once again, she's like, ""wow, this has been incredible thank you for this amazing day"" thinking we're about to go home, and that's when I give her the watch! she starts crying and says that this is the most thoughtful thing anyone has done for her. and she LOVES our anniversary engraved into it. she even said, ""ah! I don't want to wear it because I don't want to hurt it!"" but put it on anyway. in fact i feel like she was flashing it off :) which she never does with any jewelry.  and then, we were going to go to dinner but the restaurant goofed and didn't write down our reservation. she wasn't upset at all and suggested we go to *Chipotle* for our v-day dinner! so we went and she loved it because she said it was the perfect day where she didn't have to be ""on"" or ""too formal"" and ""boring"" with her family. she then laughed and mentioned how weird it was that her dad got her a watch and so did i, and that she's so grateful for me and our relationship & not to be intimidated by it all because she prefers ""this way of living"" (relaxed? i guess?)  anyway, we got home later than expected, and she got me some sort of couples coloring book, a handmade card, and a batch of cookies. we colored and ate cookies until she fell asleep... SMILING. she fell asleep smiling. I'm the happiest man alive. Thank you Reddit for telling me to continue with my v-day plans. i never would of went through with it without everyone encouraging me. it makes me laugh because after everything was said and done, she said ""we spent the entire day together and it cost *nothing*"" haha.      **tl;dr**: went through with v-day plans, everything turned out better than expected. she loved the watch and the entire day. thank you to everyone who told me to go through with my plans.

Lacy came home yesterday while I was home and immediately broke down crying when she walked through the door. She immediately apologized for leaving and for making me worry. Turns out I really underestimated Lacy's redditing and she ended up seeing the post when she was gone. Honestly I can't think of a better way for this to have gone. She told me she stayed up all night reading every single comment. In summary, she did some serious self-reflection and has admitted to me that she is suffering from depression and that the injuries were a way for her to receive the attention that she wanted so incredibly badly. But also admitted that the whole process really just made her feel pathetic and worthless inside and ultimately worsened her depression. It had become a rather vicious cycle.  We talked a long time but it was ultimately her who said she needed and wanted therapy. We have spent time today looking through her options and she plans to make an appointment Monday.  I think it was the stories from those who had similar experiences really hit it home for her.  This whole update has been pre-approved by the girl in question and she has also asked that I let you all know how much you have helped her ""get her shit together"" (her exact words).

As the edit in my original post read, I followed through. I got to the grave site before the funeral procession so that I could go over the event proceedings with the conducting officials. They were very nice and understanding of me wanting to play. They told me what my cue would be to begin playing, I took my place about 10 feet behind the grave (everyone would be gathered in front of the grave), and waited for the procession to arrive. I was very nervous, but I knew that I wanted to follow through with this no matter how it went. Once everyone was there and the casket was set in place, a pastor stood before the crowd and offered some final words while the two air force representatives stood on either side of the casket. After the pastor was done speaking, the representatives saluted and I knew it was time to begin. I took a deep breath, brought my horn up to my lips, closed my eyes and began to play, starting on a D, as some people suggested (it is a lower note, and is easier to play, and no one knows the difference). Well reddit, it was perfect. I couldn't be more happy that I was able to honor my grandfather as he asked me to before his passing. I just wanted to thank everyone for the kind words and suggestions. They were a great encouragement and I don't know if I would have ended up doing it if it wasn't for everyone here.     **tl;dr**: I did it!

48t3za,"**EDIT** Wow! I didn't expect my post to blow up like this, and thanks to whomever sent me the gold! Reading everyone's replies has helped me realize I made the right choice by leaving him. It's been an emotional rollercoaster, I've cried, laughed, felt scared, felt confused and angered. I know want to go in to counseling, which I'm planning on doing as soon as I'm able to do so. I've managed to block him on my phone, so I don't think I'll have to change my number after all. I called my apartment this morning to see if they could grab the router and cables from my place and hang on to it until they can be retrieved, they were happy to at least do that for me, so now he doesn't have internet! I did listen to a few voice mails he left for me in one message, he was calling me by my pet name, and literally talking in cutesy baby voice to me. The next voicemail he was just yelling at me. They've made me laugh but also make me well, afraid, of him. I've taken everyone's advice and I will be extremely careful for the next few months - I have pepper spray, I won't be traveling alone, and I'll be using campus or police escorts when possible.  *** So, things have happened rather rapidly since Tuesday.  [Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48k7nu/my_23f_so_30m_has_decided_he_doesnt_have_to_pay/) I talked to my mom some more about what has been going on, I wasn't too open with my parents about how bad it was. She basically wanted to get me out ASAP after I revealed more to her. Anyway, so here is what has happened so far.  * Apartment - it's in my name, the lease is up in May. I talked to my landlord about the situation a bit, basically they can't force him out because there's no official reported criminal activity. He has 30 days to leave. It would also be more expensive for me to break the lease than to pay out for the next two months. Which really sucks. March's rent has already been paid leaving April and May left. The penalty charge is 3 months rent and they can't do anything else. However, I did choose an option to put my apartment ""on market."" Which basically means they can start showing my apartment after Dipshit's 30 days are up, so he'll have no choice but to leave after that. If they happen to find someone to take the apartment before May 1, I don't have to pay that month's rent. They did copy all the documents and everything I signed and a note for him about getting out in 30 days. I left that in the apartment for him. Since his name wasn't on anything he didn't need to sign anything or be present.  * Jobs - First job: I talked my manager, she was very understanding and was able to start a transfer to a different store near where my parents live. My parents live an hour away from the apartment, btw. I still have to show up to work in my old town a few more times until the transfer is (chance it may not be accpeted) accepted, but my manager and I were able to work out a light schedule. And there will be at least 3 other people in the store with me during those times I'm scheduled. Second job: I called my old professor who was also super understanding, we had a under the table cash only agreement, so it was easy to end that working relationship. It sucked, but she understood.  * A lot of people mentioned that this was an abusive relationship. I did a lot of research on ""signs you're in an abusive relationship,"" and he checks off a lot of boxes. There were a lot of other red flags I didn't even mention in my last post about how horrible he is. This was a huge eye opener for me, and I realized the level of danger I was in by being near him. Unfortunately the revelation I've had has also caused me to feel incredibly depressed, even more so then I felt before. I'm trying not to blame myself for how horrible things have gotten, but it's really hard. I can't help but think that I shouldn't have gone this far in the relationship and that I've permanently damaged myself. But, that's a discussion for another sub. *sigh*  * As I mentioned earlier my mom wanted me to GTFO of my apartment ASAP. I had to convince her not to drive down and take me away in that moment. Dipshit worked last night and would be out of the apartment after 5pm. My mom, dad and uncle arrived at the apartment at 5:30pm. I told my best friend what was happening (who lives close to me) and she came by the apartment as well. The 5 of us were able to pack up pretty much everything I own and put it in all of our cars. So I'm now home!  * Loose ends - 1) I still have a few GRE classes to attend, but it's only once a week. 2) Hopefully the transfer will be approved for my old job, I'm still scheduled to work a few days for the next two weeks in my old town, but it's extremely light. And as I mentioned, multiple people will be in the store with me, I won't be alone at any point.  3) Anything else I need to discuss with my landlord can be handled over the phone/email. I've signed the appropriate documents. I'll likely have to pay damages after the lease has officially ended.   * Dipshit - He called me late last night after he got off work, and was obviously confused and angry. I refused to tell him where I was, which just pissed him off more. I told him that because he was financially abusing me, as well as emotionally abusing me and scarring me on a regular basis by yelling/punching things/throwing things that I couldn't take it anymore. That I deserved better, that he was a horrible person, that I didn't love him anymore, etc. Well, he stopped being angry and turned on the water works. He apologized profusely, he begged me to come back to him. He said he could change and that he was only acting out because he was depressed and I should give him another chance. He even claimed that he was ""just about to tell me that we're financially even now!"" What are the odds?? It was the most surreal conversation I've ever had in my life. I felt absolutely nothing for him, his tears didn't upset me, his anger didn't upset me, I was just cold and numb throughout the entire conversation. I felt like I was getting bored just talking to him and wanted the conversation to end asap so I could watch Netflix. I literally started to glaze over other things he was saying, he was going back and forth from being sad to angry, and I was just on the phone like ""uh huh, yeah, sure, no.."" Eventually he caught on that I stopped paying attention to him. He snapped at me and asked when I was going to stop this bullshit I was pulling. He started to rage about something, I interrupted him and said I didn't want to talk to him anymore, that he was horrible and owes me thousands of dollars, and I never want to se him again. And then I hung up on him just as he about to put on the water works again. He called and texted a lot, I haven't responded. He's been continuing to call me today as well. My next step is to get a new number.  Thanks to everyone who commented in my previous post, or pm'ed me. I wasn't able to get back to everyone, but I did read everything. The next few months are going to rough, but at least I won't be with that asshole anymore.  **tl;dr** Friends and family came to my rescue in an emergency move out last night when Dipshit was at work. I'm safe at home now, but I still have loose ends to tie up with work and the GRE class I'm taking. ","You should have said, ""I finally took out the garbage one last time.""",1775
496w95," Original https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48ln18/i_27m_want_to_marry_my_gf_25f_of_4_years_but_im/ Before I update, I just want to thank everyone. It was nice to see that not everyone called me a selfish a.hole and actually gave me great points to consider.   I took the advice about making spreadsheets and discussing having separate accounts for things such as ""disposable savings"" ""bills"" ""emergencies/if one of us loses income/accidents"" ""holidays"" ""college found"" etc  I sat Tara down yesterday after a nice day out with our dogs and told her I'd like to discuss finances and our future and asked her how she felt about things.   I tried to be as respectful as I could, and I told her that while I respect her need to take care of her family, i wanted us to be prepared so that we weren't left in a dangerous situation ourselves, especially if we want kids, we should consider what would happen if one of us or both dies, or accidents/illnesses.   She was actually very open about it all and agreed with most of it. She said although she doesn't keep separate accounts for everything, she has a set % in mind when helping her family.   I knew she had savings set aside for emergencies and also for a house but what I didn't know was that she has started saving for her siblings tuition - a very decent amount)  She has been saving a lot more than I thought she did. I'm still amazed at how she was able to save so much. She showed me her accounts and needless to say I was embarrassed for thinking she would give away all her savings, I should of known she was smarter than that.    I also discussed what would happen if she thought we didn't need something but we wanted it, and consider several scenarios. She wants to travel the world with me so she's fine with that as long as I don't exaggerate with expensive champagne and caviar  for breakfast she's fine with us indulging a little.   She is against wasting money though, so she made it clear she won't be buying expensive brands herself but said she won't tell me off for the things I do, which is fine with me.   The only thing she said would annoy her is if I ever bought an expensive car (100k +) She thinks they're a waste as most lose value pretty fast which is fair enough.   The other issue about messiness,   She actually offered a chore list and asked if I wanted to cook or clean, I'm actually hopeless at cooking and she is the best cook I've ever met so we decided she would cook and I'll help with the cleaning. She doesn't mind getting extra help (cleaner) from time to time as well since we will both be pretty busy  We also decided to have separate wardrobes so that she can chuck her stuff in without messing with mine lol   All in all things are looking good, I now have to plan the proposal, can't wait to start my life with this amazing woman. Thanks everyone       **tl;dr; talked with my lady, she's more amazing then I realized.

Thank you for all your kind thoughts and responses. A lot of people were saying to cook him a meal and then ask him so that's what I did. It was a bit of a disaster, I screwed up the chicken dish I wanted to make, ended up making mac'n'cheese with this expensive gluten free saffron pasta because Alan is King of the Kitchen and even our olive oil is fancy. He was sympathetic but I could tell he was amused when I told him I screwed up the dish and was happy with mac'n'cheese. Anyway, I was already a bit agitated from screwing up dinner but when we sat down, I was thinking about /u/tabithatortie 's comments about how Alan was my lobster. Only I was so nervous I said ""Alan, you're a lobster"" instead of saying that he was my lobster and that just confused him and asked me if I wanted him to make lobster. That just made me embarrassed so I told him not to worry about it and went to pour him some wine and ended up knocking his glass into the mac'n'cheese and ruining it.  So we ended up getting takeaway and watching Netflix and I was still a bit on edge because I'd screwed up the evening- we were cuddling so he could tell that I was a bit tense and not focused I guess. Anyway, he asked me what the matter was and I just blurted out ""Are you my boyfriend?"", he looked uncertain and said ""Yes, if you want me to be"" and I just very emphatically said I wanted him to be and he looked very relieved and happy. I apologized for evading the topic before and Alan said it was OK because I was the best boyfriend he'd ever had with or without labels and that got us to the fun portion of the night. Anyway, a bit later I guess something twigged because he asked me if that was what dinner was about and said yes and he pinched my cheeks and called me adorable. Then he asked me what the lobster thing was- he thought I'd tried to make him lobster but I explained the Friends quote and he said it was a good thing I was pretty.  Anyway, I asked him if we need to make an announcement or anything but we agreed that we wouldn't say anything unless people brought it up or we need to introduce each other. Alan also said, he liked the term partner better than boyfriend and I agreed, it does sound more serious but I guess that's what this is. TLDR: Made him dinner, the actually dinner part didn't go so well but the talk did and we're ""official"". Thanks for the suggestions people, I'll be back if I need proposal ideas. Edit: Thank you for the gold! You guys are amazing! ",">Thanks for the suggestions people, I'll be back if I need proposal ideas. Uh, no offense chief, but based on how this went, my proposal idea is you tell *him* to do the proposal, so you don't accidentally fall into an open fountain when getting down on bended knee, or choke yourself on the ring or something.",4974

Thank you all so so much. <3 After I posted, it sunk in what a big fucking deal this is. I broke down and gave everything to my boyfriend about 5 comments in. He was pissed, but fortunately I didn't even need to prove myself. He immediately jumped to overprotective boyfriend mode, and said we were turning my phone in. We called the non emergency line and I was instructed to take my phone to the sheriff's department ASAP and not to engage with Sean at all (not that I was, I'd stopped responding) From there, my phone was taken and I probably won't be getting it back for a few more days so I couldn't really update immediately and I didn't really have much of one until today anyway. I don't want to give a bunch of information out for my own privacy, and also because I'm not supposed to, but Sean no longer has a way to contact me. His phone, laptop, and his WIFE'S phone were taken when he was arrested today. Yeah, dumbshit is *married* with four damn kids. He's also been arrested for assault twice so I'm super thankful we went when we did. I don't know why exactly his wife's phone was taken, except the phone was also in his name. I was told it'd be at least a week before they could go through his computer or verify how got the images but as of right now he hasn't denied anything.  So it's obvious this isn't something that's going to be over and done with by next week, but I'm not scared anymore.  A lot of people were confused by the dick pics. My phone auto saves MMS, so I had a few from my boyfriend. Sean had sent them to me with pictures of his own (much smaller...) penis saying shit like he knew I ""preferred daddy's big cock."" Yeaaa ok.  There was a lot of really nasty shit he sent me that I didn't want to hash out in my post, but I do feel really bad that my boyfriend had to be involved. I'm really disappointed in myself for not protecting him better but he doesn't care that the detective saw his junk or that Sean did, and said it could have just as easily happened to him and someone got my pics off his phone.  My experience with the sheriff's department was honestly, awesome. I never felt like I was being judged and I was shocked because we live in a pretty small county with some pretty archaic ways of thinking. But it was fine. No one I had to speak with talked down to me, no one made it seem like my fault, nothing. Super respectful and genuinely tried to make me feel better about the whole thing. Even offered counseling services. Apparently this is SUPER common and something they end up dealing with when it gets really bad because people are afraid to tell anyone.  And to clear up why my family wouldn't care and I wouldn't care if they saw them... They just wouldn't. I grew up in a very sex positive/open minded family. My uncle is gay and owns a drag bar. My aunt is trans. My mom did nude modeling in college. They will all be ready to kill this guy before being upset or embarrassed over my vanilla tit pics =/ I wouldn't send them out all willy-nilly but if Sean did post these online, and they recognize me, at most I'll get a, ""that lingerie doesn't work with your skin tone.""  **tl;dr: boyfriend didn't doubt me for a second. Went to sheriff's department, Sean was arrested today. Fingers crossed?**",Justice boner. Edit: sorry this probably isn't the appropriate type of reply for this situation...,1574
4ai938,"When I was in my early teens, I lost most of my penis in an accident. There's nothing there now. I have testicles but basically there's no penis attached to the top of it anymore. I know this sucks, but I've come to peace with my condition. People have all sort of disabilities, this is mine and it's not the worst thing in the world. My problem is dating. All girls that I've dated so far, without exception, have walked away once they know of my condition. I don't blame them, but I'm thinking that maybe I'm not handling the situation properly. I've always told the truth fairly early on, thinking that I should let them know early on so that they can decide if they want to keep on dating as it's not fair to waste their time if this indeed is a deal breaker to them, but this has never worked well for me. Now I'm dating a girl that I really like for around a month, and I still haven't told her. Should I tell her now? Should I wait a little longer? How should I tell her? Just an honest conversation and telling them directly, which is what I've been doing so far? I'm a little disappointed with my past experiences. I know and have accepted what this situation means for me in terms of sexual life, but I'm coming to the understanding that this might even mean I can't even have relationships, which isn't what I was expecting.  **tl;dr**: I'm confused about how to communicate to potential partners about the fact that I don't have a penis. ","Hi OP, Other have given some good advice so I'm going to go down a different route...  Have you cut sex out of your life completely? Or are you still active? I mean, you have your fingers and tongue and there are ALL kinds of toys out there. I don't know if you're into this at all but I know a lot of women are into pegging and might even be turned on by your situation.  Check out /r/sex if you have any questions or feel like you need advice. Secondly, how you present the situation is important. If you DO wish to be sexually active then I suggest saying something like; ""There's something I need to tell you, I was involved in an unfortunate accident when I was younger and now I don't have a penis. This is something I have accepted and come to terms with myself and I understand you may need some time to do the same. Before you go and have a think about how you would like to proceed, let me tell you that I am still very interested in sexual activities, I can give oral like nobody else and I'm willing to play with dildo's / strapons. I'd really like for us to try this out and see how it goes, if it doesn't work out, then no hard feelings, I'll be content that we tried. I'll give you as much time as you need to think this over."" I wish you the best of luck OP!",4048

All of it was really helpful, and it calmed me down, and gave me a plan.  I went up to my dad on monday, and said this to him ""Dad, I love you and I'm worried about how you've been behaving recently. You're a good father and I'm scared that you're going to do something rash and you won't be around anymore. Please talk to me and tell me what's going on."" (Credit to /u/abitnotgood). My dad just had a deer in the headlights look. I then told him ""Dad, you've been acting different lately with buying a gun, and crying, and all the other things. What's going on? I know you are having a lot of feelings because the guy who killed mom is getting out soon. So am I, we can work on this together."" My dad broke down, and so did I. We talked about how hard it was for him when Mom first died, how he was sorry for being so distant in the first few years, how he felt like a terrible father and husband. I asked him the question if he intended to kill the other guy, or commit suicide. He cried even harder, and said he was confused, and didn't know if killing that guy would avenge mom's death. I told him that Mom wouldn't want him to go to jail for the rest of his life, and neither do I. That guy wasn't worth it, and I didn't want him to take both my parents away from me. I bought up counseling, and he agreed to go. I got one separate for him and me, because I didn't feel it was right to intrude upon his closure. I mean he did know my mom as a different person, and had different experiences. We are going to a therapist this saturday, one in the city, and my dad promised to sell the shotgun. I want to thank everyone here from the bottom of my heart for helping me, and my dad though this. Thank you.       **tl;dr**: My dad and I talked it out, we got to the problem, we are going to get help.

4at6b8,"Throwaway because I have no idea if anyone has reddit.     Backstory: My grandparents have always been a big part of my life, as well as, the rest of my family. They had five kids (including my dad) and have 13 grandchildren- 6 great-grandchildren.  My grandparents are pretty wealthy. They owned three businesses up until last year when my grandpa passed away. I’m the “baby” of the grandchildren and have always been really close with them. My grandma babysat me until I was able to go to Kindergarten, I wrap her Christmas presents for every one every year, I decorate their house, and I’ve worked at their bar on Friday night’s throughout college (without pay) as they got too old to do these things themselves. All of these things were offered to my cousins but they never helped out.   My grandparents ran a horse training farm for show horses for over 40 years. This was something my dad took up with them and I quickly started to love. I rode every weekend with my grandma up until high school when I started to get busy. Even though I don’t ride much anymore, my dad and I go out and clean the stalls every week and take care of the horses when my grandparents went on trips (usually every other month).   My grandparents were a huge part of my life.     The problem: My grandma passed away 4 weeks ago. It was devastating. My grandma left my aunts/uncles/dad about $85,000 each. Money that her and my grandpa worked very very hard for. This was expected. What wasn’t expected was for them to leave me a little over $45,000 along with some other things of value. I was honestly shocked. My cousins all got about $2,000 each and some knick-knacks. Obviously, you can see where this was going. My aunts and uncles were in the reading when I was told so they told their kids. Everyone besides my parents are furious. My cousins (who are adults) are demanding I split it evenly with them. I don’t feel that I have to. I was very close with my grandparents and did a lot for them but this is hard. My family is very tight and we do annual vacations together/monthly parties/dinners/etc. I never expected money would tear us apart. This money could change a lot for me. I could pay off my $10,000 student loan and put the rest toward my upcoming wedding/future children/a savings account. A small part of me wants to divide it evenly just to keep everyone together. BUT there was a reason they left me this. They didn’t do it to hurt anyone. I was the ONLY one to visit them and help them out (none of them took the time to see them aside from family get-togethers) but no one understands that aside from my parents. I feel like I’m single-handedly tearing the family apart. My aunts and uncles won’t talk to my dad unless I split the money and my cousins won’t talk to me. I only have a student loan and car payment so I don’t have much debt but this could set me up for a comfortable future. They all keep throwing in my face that they have families, house payments, college to pay for, etc. They keep saying I’ve been planning this for a long time but I truly haven’t. I loved my grandparents.   My fiancé is telling me to forget about them and to do what’s best for me but I’m a huge family person. I don’t want to split the money (it could really help me) but I feel that they could be playing me by making me choose between them and it.  My parents also want me to keep the money as they feel my family members are being ridiculous by demanding this.   Is it right for me to keep this much? I feel like I deserve it. Is it right for me to put this money over my family? Or are the people who I’ve been so close with my entire life taking advantage of me? $45,000 vs $2,000 is a huge difference.   So, advice??  EDIT: there's more in the will than I explained (houses, classic cars, horses, the farm, land, CD's, etc). The cash/checking accounts that were given to me are the only things that seem to be the problem with everyone.      **tl;dr**: inherited more money than my cousins. They're demanding I split it evenly between then or neve talk to them again.","Your cousins are showing you who they are through their actions. They are the ones willing to put money over family, not you. The appropriate reaction to your getting the inheritance would have been, ""Well, OP was very close with g'ma and it was g'ma's money so it's not any of my business.""  NOT ""gimme some.""  You are totally in the right here and if they are going to behave like this, perhaps they are not the family that you thought they were in the first place.",6468
4bigey,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44pve2/should_i_22m_propose_to_my_terminally_ill/) I decided about three weeks ago that I would ask her to marry me, regardless of the future implications. Later that day, her dad called me and let me know she had slipped into a coma and was not responsive. She died the following day. She went very peacefully.  I just wanted to say thank you all for the kind messages in my earlier post. She was also a student at my school, so I have the blessing to be able to mourn with my community. It will be a long road of grieving, but I promised her I would be okay.     **tl;dr**: She passed away, but I WILL be ok! EDIT: I've gotten a few nasty messages about karma whoring, and that this is fake. I would be happy to verify with a mod, but i'd rather not put her information out in public out of respect for her family. This got more attention than I thought it would, so I figured i'd give a little more info. The day I went to visit her, she wasn't exactly in a coma, but she was barely responsive. She smiled an made a little happy noise when her mom told her I had come to see her. She was 5'4"" and 75lbs that day. She had a tube coming out each nostril and four coming from various organs in her abdomen, and she was in a lot of pain. I sat by her side and told her how much I loved her and promised her that I would be ok. I told her how I will live the rest of my life with her in my mind. I cried and cried, but rejoiced in the idea that she would soon not be in pain.  She gave me the confidence to be who I am today. Even through it all of this she taught me to choose happiness.  The hardest part of it is just accepting it's over. I am so used to taking care of her every spare minute I had. I see a funny vine or picture And I want to send it to her so so bad.  Her burial was absolutely beautiful. It was just her parents, her sister, and I. It was open casket, so I got to see her face one last time. It really was the closure I needed. There were no tubes coming out of her, the jaundice had faded, and there was not a trace of pain that she wore on her face for so long. A few days later she had her memorial service, which was incredible. There was around 1,200 people that signed the guest book. She was loved!  Since then, it has been a few weeks since and I am doing pretty well. I feel that I am kind of denying things until I graduate, and then I will have time to grieve. For now, I am surrounding  myself with loved ones and staying busy. Thank you all for the kind words!  ","Letting everyone know that the story was in fact, verified. ",845

Her and her husband are one of those people that have a ton of adopted kids (eight so far) and are super religious. To each his own. Mary enjoys telling everyone at work her business, so when she decided to adopt a kid from the Ukraine, everyone heard about it. She went with an older kid because it was easier for her and her husband (she says). This was two years ago. Mary has asked me to babysit the boy a couple of times (I'll call him Tony), and it's never been a problem because I like kids. I didn't see any glaring problems despite Mary's constant dramatics about how awful the kid was and he seemed to like being over (it's just me and my boyfriend here, and our place is small but clean and really well kept. Mary's house is...disgusting for lack of a better word). Mary would harp constantly about how much Tony liked it at our house but I just chalked it up to the kid having a good time. Lately Mary has been at work, talking to anyone that'll listen about how awful Tony is, how horrible he is to the other kids, and how she's going to get rid of him. She sent out a freaking mass email to everyone in our department asking if someone wanted to take her kid from her. She calls it ""re-homing"" and that its okay. I logged onto Facebook today and same story...she has pics of Tony posted to her timeline advertising him for re-adoption and to contact her if interested!!  I haven't replied to her email yet, and I haven't commented on her post but I'm this close to ripping into her for what she's doing. She's crossed the line from weird into full blown psycho. Should I call CPS? The police? I don't know much about adoption and a quick search for rehoming gets me mostly results about animals. Any advice?     **tl;dr** Crazy coworker is trying to pawn her kid off to strangers in the office or on the Internet. She claims it's legal. What should I do? EDIT: Shit has hit the fan. There's mass insanity right now, but I'll have an update for everyone tonight. Most importantly: the kids are safe. ","You need to call CPS and the local police.  ""Re-homing"" international adoptees is actually really common with a certain sort of abusive adoptive parent, and it's led to many children's deaths at the hands of people who should never have had them.  It's a form of child-trafficking, and obscenely it's got a dubious legality in a lot of states.  You need to jump on this _now_, before the poor kid is shipped out of state.

I got a lot of responses and it really helped me better understand what he was going thru. We were finally able to have a good talk about it. He told me what a lot of you said. That truck was his identity and part of who he was.  I told him I knew he didn't want that car he bought and he told me I was right. We talked more an enventually figured out something that would work. He sold the car he had and we agreed he could just use mine. Our schedule works out to where he could take me to work and pick me up on time. It wasn't a big hassle and I was going on maternity leave soon anyways. He found a totaled truck for sale and the engine was still in good condition. It was the engine he wanted. He bought the truck for what was supposedly a really good deal and him and a couple friends ripped everything out of it that he needed and got rid of the body. The engine is in our garage now. It took him a couple weeks but he found a truck to put the engine into and him and a friend are going to pick it up this weekend. He's back to his old self again and baby is gonna be here soon and we couldn't be more excited!!  Tldr: husband had to sell his truck because of our baby and he wasn't the same afterwards.

4cfe98,"To summarize the last post, I posted a Ryan Reynolds meme about Santa Claus not being real on Facebook which my 13-year-old niece saw. My sister flipped out about it and wanted me to publicly rescind and say how Santa is real, but I thought my nieces were too old to believe in that stuff and refused. It lead to a crazy fight between us. Link to the [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ad97e/me_32f_posted_on_facebook_about_santa_claus_not/). Anyway, I talked to my nieces and neither of them believe in Santa, so they were baffled about the fight. I talked to my BIL and he said my sister has been flying off the handle lately. We agreed she should probably get a check up and he convinced her to go to the doctor.  Onto the update. They did a MRI and nothing showed up. Then they did some bloodwork which looked fine, except some elevated cholesterol. She isn't pregnant. They pretty much wrote her off as a crazy person and sent her to a psychologist for stress. After a session, the psychologist told her to do some ""deep breathing"" and sent her away as fixed. She got worse. She stopped sleeping and barely ate, yet still gained weight. Any small annoyance would send her into a rage. Commercials were making her so upset she would ugly cry. I asked my BIL if they tested hormone levels or anything like that and he said the doctors didn't feel it was necessary. She called me one day crying and apologizing, saying she was the worst sister ever and I had every right to hate her. She was so devastated she ruined our relationship and such. It was weird and NOT my sister, so when I got a chance to speak I told her she was going to go see my doctor and I wasn't taking no for an answer. I set up an appointment and my doctor ordered a full blood panel including hormone and vitamins before my sister drove to town for her appointment. When my sister drove up we spent the morning shopping and she was unpredictable. One minute she was happy and the next yelling about some perceived sight (""That fucking pretentious makeup counter bitch just looked at me funny for my cheap drug store makeup.""). It was uncomfortable, So I just walked on eggshells to keep her from exploding. Anyway, results of the bloodwork and a good doctor: perimenopause. Her hormones are completely abnormal. None of her doctors would even consider it because she was ""too young"" for menopause, so they didn't even bother running the tests. She'll be coming up with a care plan with my doctor for hormone replacement therapy and diet change to hopefully get back on track. She still a nutcase right now. For example, she called me crying the other night because she will never have more kids (wha...her husband had a vasectomy years ago). I'm driving to her place next weekend and we're going to batch cook a bunch of meals for her new diet plan (I'll be doing it with her as I could stand to eat healthier). So it'll be a slow process, but we have a diagnosis and plan. I'm just taking her outbursts as ""crazy hormones"" right now because it'll take awhile to even out.  I got her a dark chocolate cake for Easter that said, ""Happy Reverse Easter (when the Easter Bunny takes back your eggs)"" because I'm kind of a jerk. She thought it was hilarious though, so we are good. **TL/DR;** Sister is going through perimenopause, so she's irrationally, but understandably nutty right now. Oh, and Santa Claus still doesn't exist. **Edit:** Removed the comment about being bipolar. Though my SIL has professionally diagnosed bipolarism and does have wildly swinging moods within minutes sometimes (though usually a manic high or low lasts weeks), it wasn't my intention to slur a group of people. My sister was acting very much like my SIL can act sometimes, so it was the best reference I could make. I apologize for offending anybody.","Good for you!  As women who have had children, our hormone levels should be checked often.  I had the same issue as your sister.  I was told by my doctor that I was clinically depressed and was given pills for depression.  When they didn't work, I was told to double the dose.  That's when I knew something was off.  I went to a psychologist and was told I just needed to give the depression pills time to work, so I stopped doing that too.  Finally I found a doctor that worked in bio-identical hormones.  He did all the blood work and lo and behold, my body had stopped producing the needed levels of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.  After a new diet plan (paleo) and some good compounding hormone replacement therapy, I'm as good as new.   I wish your sister all the best.  This is not easy to go through.  You can't control your emotions when your levels are off, no matter how hard you try.  Also, you are a great sister for not giving up and recognizing this might be the issue.  ",1541
4cyij0,https://pr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4btp9x/me_33_m_with_my_wife_32_f_11_years_im_falling_for/ Original post.  About 3 day's after my post I read all the comments and realized everyone was right. And I want to be 100% faithful to my wife and this woman is NOT worth losing my family. Some posters said something may be missing from my marriage. and I thought about it and realized me and my wife don't spend that much time together. So I talked to my wife about it I told her how I felt and what was on my mind and we had a heart to heart. We cried a little and I don't want to lose her we made a schedule and are going to work out date nights for us to spend more time together. As for Talia. Me and her met up and I told her the honest truth I'm married and I don't want to do something I'll regret forever. I told her my feelings were getting a little to inappropriate and that maybe we should not talk outside of work. She agreed and told me she started feeling the same and that we should limit contact. She said it's for the best and that I'm a good man because most men would have just let it continue but I didn't. So we ended our friendship.  In the mean time I'm going to focus on my family and my wife and distract myself from thinking of Talia. Looking back it wouldn't have been worth it because my wife has been with me through everything. When I lost my job when my parents died when I needed surgery. She's had my children and sacrifices for them and takes care of them without asking for anything in return. And I'm happy with her and I couldn't replicate all those memories with any woman. She's the only one for me and I realized and appreciate all the things she does for me and our family. That's the update and hopefully I'll never have to return to this sub-reddit again.     **tl;dr**: got my head out of my ass and realized how important my wife and family are to me. I ended my friendship with Talia and am going to focus on my wife and family now.,"GOOD! Glad to hear, you did the right thing. The key to avoiding an affair is to cut it off when you first begin to feel things that are inappropriate, and to focus on your own marriage. I wish you all the best :)",1464
4dmdc2,"Reddit, please help me. I'm at my wits end. This is going to read like ""we see what we want to see"" but I assure you that's not the case. My husband and I have been married a bit over a year, we were together for 4 before that. Not long distance, normal relarionship, moved in together at around the 2 year mark. He was damn close to perfect. Really he was. Even after the honeymoon phase wore off, damn close to perfect.  Here's the guy I married: Attentive, sensual and comfortable with his sexuality, brave, honorable, honest, communicated well, respectfully told me when he took issue with something I had done and accepted criticism gracefully when I was upset with him, then we worked out the issue together and it STAYED fixed. A great mix of social and alone time - he didn't want to go out to much or stay in too much which was great for me because I'm very introverted with a touch of social anxiety. Nothing too bad, I'm just one of those people who never wants to go out.... then has a blast when I get there. He had a great job and goals and we were planning a great future. He was supportive of my career development (I was a late starter, went to college late). He was proud of me and always walked around like a preening peacock with me in public. We were That Couple, guys.  His ONLY faults were that he sometimes did what his mother wanted, even when it was more than a little unreasonable, but we set some boundaries with her and that got better, and he could be a little scatterbrained/inconsiderate in the way of he wouldn't ASK me about plans, he would TELL me the day before. I fixed that one by saying he was welcome to go alone, but if I made other plans and he hadn't told me, I was sticking with my other plans.  Those are pretty minor things in the grand scheme of things. All out friends told me I finally got it right, half of them would have happily dated him if we broke up. Not in a creepy way, just a ""You're super lucky, he's awesome, I've always had a little crush on him"" way. And then we got married. I have no ue who this man is anymore. We nearly never have sex. He acts like he's asexual. Before, it was sexts and jumping me as soon as I walked in the door. Now its one position, with the lights off, once every 2 or 3 weeks. It's like he's self conscious and afraid of sex now. He stopped communicating. He hates everything about me. I'm Buddhist, he's agnostic, but he used to be interested in what I had to say about my beliefs. Very interested. I never tried to convert him, it's just a part of my life I value. He used to love intellectual and philosphical discussions about Buddhism, now he just tunes out or says ""ok"". That's his go to for anything. My needs, my thoughts, my feelings, my concerns, my likes and dislikes are all met with ""ok"".  We never go out anymore. I mean NEVER. I still sometimes go to events with friends, he isn't interested.  He quit his job without telling me because he ""hated it"" and took a job as a delivery driver for Amazon. This was like a $40k yr PAY CUT. There is no money for the training and class I need for my career. But yet he finds money for his collectibles and whatever he wants. If I ask, he says it's my problem. I need to fund my own advancement. Which would be right, to a point, except it would advance US. And he HAD been helping. He had agreed to continue to. He does nothing around the house anymore. I was away for 4 days and came home to find stale food in the cat's dishes that had sat there since I left and they had no water. The younger is half Siamese and he was yowling anf going stir crazy because he hadn't been played with. He used to adore those cats and snuggle and play with them all the time. No laundry was done. There was a sink full of dishes.  The mommy issue is back. She says jump and he asks how high. Period. He spends entire days with her morning to night for days in a row. She has no health issues, this isn't a caregiver situation. When I've talked to him about it he says I don't ""understand"" what it's like to have family (I'm NC with my abusive mother, my father passed when I was 11, I have a brother who lives in another country). It feels personal. Like he rubs my nose in his family. He's no longer a gentlemen. He no longer has my back and stands up for me. We have jerkwad neighbors who leave crap in our yard, are loud and obnoxious, and just generally assholes. One day I got in an argument with one of them because they were having a party and PARKING IN OUR DRIVEWAY and where my BF would have shown a united front, my HUSBAND told me to ""stop being hormonal"", looked at the neighbor and said ""You know how women are"" and HAD A BEER with him. Reddit, I don't know this guy and I don't like him. Is this who he really is? I LIVED with him for 2 years and saw none of this. I wouldn't have married this asshole. He makes me feel like shit about myself and like I'm less than. I feel like I have a bratty teenager and not a husband.  But yet I saw nearly none of this. Like I said, just 2 minor issues. He was amazing. And now that I'm married to him I don't know him. Can someone really fake a personality 24/7 for 2 years? So well that none of their true self bleeds through? I don't want to spend my life with someone who hates me and everything about me, who is either zoned in front of the computer or at moms, who acts like I'm dipped in shit when I try to touch him. I wouldn't have married that guy. I thought I married an adult partner. tl;dr Husband did a total 180 after wedding. Why? What do I do?",None of his changes even seem to benefit him. A lower paying job? Not going out? Not having sex? It's not like you said he changed and now he travels the world without you or something else where at least he's benefitting. Maybe it's something medical like a brain tumor or something. Maybe this is what his parents' marriage was like and he thinks he should be this way because of how they were? I'm very confused for you.,4521
4dxmdu,"First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4djfm8/my_16f_father_59m_acts_creepy_towards_me_should_i/ I told my brother everything and showed him all the texts as almost all of you told me to do so. He was shocked. For a few minutes I couldn't say what he was thinking but after that he told me that I should have told him sooner, and that he will make sure our father never bothers us again. For a moment I thought he was upset at me but he was really furious at our father. He asked our father to come over and told me to remain in my room until he leaves. They ended up having a big fight and they were loud which I could hear. Father was yelling that a parent has a right to raise his daughter as he sees fit, brother told him that he doesn't even know how to spell the word parent. He eventually left. He sent me a text that ""your brother is way over his head, don't choose him over your own father"". I replied (with my brother's permission) that ""I'll choose him over a thousand sperm donors like you. I don't want to see you ever again"". And then I blocked his number. I'm very happy that my brother did this. I feel much better and safer now. He's always made me feel safe. When he has his own kids I'm sure he will be the most amazing father in the world as he has been one for me. He said that he'll also inform the police and school, and if my father tries anything I should tell him immediately to maybe look for some legal way to keep him away. I just hope that my sperm donor of a father stays away from us forever.     **tl;dr**: I told my brother and he confronted our father and told him to stay away and never contact us again. I blocked his number and social media.",Wow your brother is amazing! Hope you'll never have to deal with this again,2802
4dzxtx,"OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dkl4r/overheard_roommates_2024m_talking_about_how/ Firstly, I just wanted to thank you guys for being so sweet in the last thread. I was so stressed out and you guys made me laugh. : ) First update was removed because I forgot a link, but I fixed it. Onto the update. Before I posted, I was basically set on hiding awkwardly in my room or maybe dressing more conservatively when I left my room. After I saw all your responses, I was filled with a feminist, body-positive rage. These boys were not going to get away with slut shaming me.  Of the three guys, I'm closest with Tom (Boy 1/3), so I decided to talk to him individually. I heard him coming up the stairs and I just took a deep breath and walked out of my room, smiled, and asked if I could talk to him for a minute.  He came into my room and we were just making small talk. I shut the door, summoned all of my assertiveness, and said, ""So, I actually have something weird to talk to you about. I heard you guys talking about me the other day."" I'd like to say that I threw down with this boy, that I told him that sexism is not cool or funny and I won't put up with it and demand that he apologize. But instead I, um.  I cried.  A lot.  I straight up just broke down, I couldn't even speak. Tom look absolutely devastated. He immediately apologized, said I wasn't supposed to hear any of that, but I wasn't really paying attention because I was just trying to get a grip on myself. There's nothing more awkward than crying in front of someone when you're ""not on that level"" yet.  Anyway, I asked him if that was really what he thought of me. He said no, and that they were just being dumb, and that when Sam (Boy 2/3) brought it up he was really surprised and knew it was wrong but he didn't call him out on it. He said he should have, and he knew he should have, but he didn't want to make a big deal about it because Sam and Bob (Boy 3/3) were just joking around, even though they were being mean. He said it was shitty of him not to call them out and that by not saying anything and acting like it was funny, he allowed it to happen. He said that he has no excuse and he's sorry. This checks out- from what I heard, it was mainly Sam and Bob saying the bad stuff. I said I knew they were just joking around but it made me feel horrible to be talked about that way, and that the sexism really slapped me in the face.  He agreed and said it was horrible, and he also said something like ""not that it's an excuse, but you're really pretty and I think thats why we were talking about you that way. none of us actually believed what we were saying but i think it was just wishful thinking and we were idiots about it.""  So for all you guys who suggested that they were attracted to me- BINGO.  I laughed and told Tom that I had a girlfriend. He said that was totally cool, and then looked embarrassed and said they must have looked like complete idiots bragging about how much I wanted to sleep with them. I agreed.  Tom asked if there was anything he could do to make up for it. I told him not to tell the other guys anything because I don't really want to talk about it anymore, but if they ever start talking about another person like that, even if it's not me, to speak up. He promised me he would and apologized about 9000000 more times and left.  I heard him go into his room, and then immediately leave and go out the front door. I didn't think much of it and put my headphones in and played Trackmania for a while. Later that day I opened my door and there was a big cardboard box right outside my door. My first thought was that I'd ordered something from amazon and forgot about it, but it looked like a used box that someone had repurposed and taped shut. I dragged it into my room and opened it.  Guys. It was a bouquet of flowers and a cake with the word ""SORRY"" written on it.  If you're thinking that I cried for the second time in three hours, well . . . you're right.  Anyway, I'm sorry I didn't throw down with them like so many of you wanted. Unfortunately I am but a tiny creampuff. I'm working a lot on being more assertive but in this scenario I handled it as best as I could. Confronting Tom about it was actually super scary, but I'm proud of myself for bringing it up at all.  I accept Tom's apology. He seemed genuine, and this does seem like a one-off shitty behavior situation. He's usually a pretty stand-up guy. The other guys . . . I don't know. To be honest, I wasn't super sold on them to start with, so I feel like I'll just continue to not pursue a friendship with them. And I'll continue to dress however I want. : ) Lastly, serious thanks to all of you for your responses. I was hesitant to post this on reddit because reddit can sometimes be . . . not so nice about women's issues. But yall are cool. <3      **tl;dr**: Talked to one of the boys about it, cried a lot, got cake. ",">Unfortunately I am but a tiny creampuff. Aww, so cute. Good job on standing up for yourself. Assertiveness comes one step at a time. I'm proud of you!",2824
4emd76,"My sister was set to marry a guy who was a complete douchebag.  He seemed like a nice catch to any outsider; he was tall, handsome, very confident, a doctor, basically the sort of guy any woman would swoon over.  Unfortunately he was a sociopathic unrepentant narcissist devoid of any empathy who would take out his anger on anybody he felt beneath him and seemed to enjoy doing it. You know how basically they say, don't look at how your partner treats you, look at how he treats others, and thats how he'll eventually treat you? My sister didn't pick up on that. I picked up on it early, this guy was really mean, would berate and insult people for the smallest thing and would lose his cool with anybody who looked at him the wrong way.  He started doing it to me, and I told my sister early on this guy's an asshole.  She was like ""nah, you two will eventually get along, you just got off on the wrong start"".  I told him I've seen him do that to other people, but she seemed to think ""oh, but he's nice to ME, I'm the SPECIAL one, maybe I can change him!"" Or I have no idea what she was thinking. After about 2 years together, when they were engaged, the cracks were evident.  My parents loved him, his dad and my dad go way back, they both went to the same medical school together and have been close friends for decades.  Her fiance is also good friends with my two older brothers.  After 2 years, my sister was realising this guy was an asshole, he's always been an asshole, and he won't change.  There was a really painfully obvious example one day when we were having dinner, and my sister's fiance and my dad were having a discussion about something political.  My sister tried to offer her opinion into the discussion, and they both snickered, then this guy just started berating her and ripping into her infront of everyone, making her feel this small.  I could sense her pain, she was just quiet and just sat there taking it.  I was thinking ""what are you doing with this guy, he has no respect for you, he has no love for you.""   Another time our family was at this dinner function where a lot of big people were around.  My sister's fiance completely left my sister alone at the table with me, and was sitting at this other table with two women, very obviously flirting with them semi-drunk. He just left her all alone at the table.  I asked her what was wrong, why was he ignoring her?  She told me they had had an argument earlier and this was his way of punishing her.  You see what I mean when I say this guy is a complete sociopath? My sister and I are really close, and even though I'm younger by far, little brothers aren't devoid of wisdom, and I've been urging her from day 1 to break up with this guy before she gets in too deep.  Well now, that she'd spent two years with him and was engaged, she was obviously in too deep, and she used to tell me about all the outbursts he has, how he treats her with no respect.  We often had long discussions, just me and her, where she'd spill open like a can of beans and just divulge all the bullshit that he's put her through recently.  Sometimes she'd cry and I'd be there to help her out, but she still seemed to want to stick with him.  She actually convinced herself that he loved her behind all that horrible treatment, and couldn't pull herself to cancel the engagement what with our parents, his parents, everyone counting on it.  She knew they'd all say she's crazy, turning down this smart handsome doctor! Who does she think she is?! I kept urging her to break up, but she stuck with the ""he'll change"" or ""he loves me deep down"" excuses.  It all came to a heads when one day she very publicly exploded at him.  We were having a huge dinner, both sides of our families, and I was sitting next to him.  He kept bullying me the entire night,  ""move your elbows over"" ""couldn't you wear something a bit more presentable?""  ""stop sticking your hand out like that, its rude""  ""don't you think you've had enough of that""?  If I asked him to pass a bowl or the sauce or something, he'd hand it over but then pull away and be like ""say please, say thankyou.""  He was smiling the entire time, laughing.  My two older brothers were also snickering, they didn't seem to mind this guy was publicly bullying me and having fun with it. He and my dad started having one of their conversations again, and my dad started airing out all his general frustrations and disappointments regarding me, and they started both talking about my life openly in front of me.  Her fiance then turned to me and started openly lecturing me, and when I tried to ignore him ""hey, are you listening to me? whats the matter with you? your dad never taught you any respect?"" My sister just then basically exploded. She was sitting at the other side of the table (guessing she didn't want to be near him) but she was watching what was going on the entire time.  She just stood up and completely exploded, it was horribly frightening and scary.  She started shouting at him ""LEAVE HIM ALONE. HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO YOU, WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON HIM. JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE"" etc etc.  I'd never seen her shout like that or explode like that in my entire life, it was absolutely terrifying.  We were all stunned silent.  She had tears in her eyes and ran upstairs crying. I wanted to go upstairs to speak with her and comfort her, my dad was like ""where are you going?"" I told him I just wanted to see how sis was doing and check up on her, he was just like ""no you stay here, you stay seated"". So he made me stay seated until the end of the dinner. For hours my sister was up there I didn't even know how she was, my dad or mom didn't care, my two older brothers didn't care; I had to wait hours till everyone left before I could slip up and go talk to her. She was an absolute mess, crying, mascara running all down her face like darth maul.  I told her she has to end this, she's going to jeopardise her entire life if she continues with this guy.  She has to do the painful thing now and rip off the bandaid.  I told her 'you might think its okay if he just does this to you because you can take it, but do you really want to bear his kids?  what if you have his kids, and then he starts treating them the same way?' She finally agreed with me and said she would end their relationship and break up, it was the only option.  I just asked one thing, that she doesn't tell anyone that I convinced her to do it, because they all already seemed to have it in for me enough already. Well the one thing I asked her to do, she couldn't hold up her end.  She still somehow let everyone know that **I** was the one who so graciously helped her make the right decision.  Of course this immediately made everyone hate me.  Aside from my dad occasionally going off at me and shouting, it was mostly just the silent treatment and people giving me glares, which was easy enough for me to bear. My sister moved all her stuff over the next few days out of her fiance's place back into her own apartment which apparently she's gonna live in indefinitely now.  Her old room in our house has been converted into a billiard/pool table room anyway. My dad and brothers were making my life hell for me, they blamed me for everything. My mom was occasionally nice to me but she's nice to everyone, I could feel her disappoint with me ran very deep.  She didn't offer any words of comfort or advice even though she knew my dad and brothers hated me right now.  My brothers basically flat out refused to talk to me aside from a few sentence words here and there, they didn't want to engage with me on any level even when I'd try to start conversations with them.  My dad I just tried to avoid so he doesn't have an angry outburst. It all erupted eventually into a huge fight between me and him.  He was just shouting at me on and on and on, telling me I was a pathetic loser, disgusting.  My brothers told me how much they hated me.  My dad kept saying ""its not enough that you ruin your own life and turn yourself into a failure, now you have to drag your sister down to and ruin her life? why do you hate everyone and try to ruin our family?""  No matter how much I tried to explain how this guy wasn't a good guy, they seemed to think it was just a personal vendetta I had against him.  My brother told me that I didn't deserve to have my sister as my sister, I told him to go fuck himself.  My dad was like ""what did you say?"" I told him he could go fuck himself as well.  Admittedly, I lost my cool after hours of all of them attacking me and I shouldn't have said that.  My dad absolutely lost it with me and told me to get out of his house, he never wanted to see me ever again. I tried to apologise, he basically just told me to get out, even though I was on the verge of tears.  I left the house and they locked the door behind me. I called my sister, she came and picked me up and drove me to her place where I explained to her everything that had happened.  She told me she'd call them the next morning and talk to dad once he'd cooled down, and then he'd be happy to take me back.  I was still kind of teary and she comforted me and told me I shouldn't hate myself or take too seriously what my dad says, and I had been the only one brave enough to convince her to do the right thing.  Her place isn't big, but she let me stay there; her double bed is just wide enough for two people but it was cozy so we slept well and fine and the next morning she called up my parents home.  She wanted to try to talk to them reasonably and see if she could make ammends and get them to accept me back. She told me to wait in the bedroom while she had a really long conversation with my parents over the phone, it went well over an hour, and there was a lot of shouting.  She told me she was stunned and she had spoken to both our parents and our brothers too, she said she couldn't believe it and was appalled at what jerks they were being.  They said they were serious about not letting me back into their home no matter how much she pleaded with them, and had said she had to go pick up my stuff from my parents house. My sister drove over there and picked up whatever stuff would fit in the car, I didn't have that much aside from my laptop, books, and clothes, and brought it back. She herself seemed horrified at the way they were acting and seemed to be barely able to believe it.  She tried calling them again later and the next day again; even though they had calmed down they were still adamant that I couldn't return no matter how much she tried to reason and plead with them.  She eventually got pretty angry with them too.  They were seriously trying to cut me out of their life. My sister told me as a result she was going to cut the rest of our family out of her life.  I told her she doesn't have to do that, she told me she does have to and she wants to.  She said she was permanently cutting off all relations and contact with our father, mother and both brothers until they apologised for the way they treated me and accepted me back into their family.  I told her she doesn't have to do that, she insisted its the least she could do. Instead of making me feel good, it just made me feel worse and more guilty, like I was responsible for the permanent fracturing of our family.  So now my sister has completely cut herself off from the rest of the immediate family and cut them completely out of her life.  She told me I'm welcome to stay with her and live here indefinitely, as long as I want, even though I barely have any money and I'm a full time student so there's not many ways I can compensate aside from doing chores.  She said now that shes actually seriously completely cutting her family off, she'd like to have the one remaining family member close by.  So here I am now. I honestly feel responsible for this whole mess of a situation. I think its good that I helped my sister get out of that horrible relationship with that awful guy, but now look at the fallout.  I'm cut off from the rest of the family, they hate me and don't want anything to do with me, and I'm not welcome back there.  My sister has done the same to them, cutting them all off, she said even for the rest of her life if need be. It all feel so horrible and terrible, I didn't want it to end up like this, our family permanently fractured apart and everyone hating each other.  I just want to make peace for the family and for everyone to love each other again and get back and forgive each other, I really wish there was something I could do reconciliate them but it seems so unlikely especially since nobody seems to want to and I'm at the centre of it all.  Any ideas for what I can do to help heal this huge rift and reconciliate my family? Or should I just leave things the way they are and get on with my life, for better or for worse?  Nothing I can do to help mend the situation?     **tl;dr**: **Sister was engaged to a massive narcissistic douchebag who my dad seemed to really like.  I convinced her to break up with him, now my dad hates me and blames me for everything.  My two brothers also weren't too happy with me and neither was my mother.  It all ended up in a huge fight and my dad permanently kicked me out of his house and said he doesn't want to see me again, now I'm stuck staying with my sister.  She called them on my behalf to try to reconcile us, instead she ended up saying she's cutting *them* out of *her* life and never wants to see them again until they apologise for the way they treated me and make up for it.  I feel horrible and partly responsible for this whole mess, but I just wish there was something I could do to help mend the situation?**","Unfortunately, I think part of the reason your sister wound up with this jerk in the first place is that your family conditioned her to think that her needs aren't as important as pleasing other people.  Think about it: they're screaming at you for ""ruining her life,"" even though she's standing right there telling them the exact opposite.  Which means they'd either rather double down on punishing you than admit they were wrong, or they're more upset about this guy not becoming a part of the family than how he treats actual family.   Either way, that's their issue, not yours.  Take advantage of your sister's support, and assuming your family doesn't realize they're being idiots and apologize, forge a new life for yourself that's surrounded by people who listen to you and put your needs above their own agendas.",3360
4f5lph,"After college graduation, I got a job at a start-up in the tech industry. Unfortunately as you may know, many start-ups fail. After about 1.5 years working there, I was out of a job. My closest friend at that job was Beth.   Beth and I decided we were going to make a team effort at finding new jobs, since we knew we were going to be applying at the same jobs anyway. We have very similar experiences and backgrounds.  She and I were incredibly diligent with our job search. I can't stress this enough. I had written six unique cover letters and resumes that served as templates--they highlighted my experiences in ways that catered to the jobs I was applying. Each template had a label and a description. When I applied for a job, I would read the description, match that to whichever template was the most suited, and applied, etc.   Beth did the same thing with hers. We also were incredibly diligent at editing each others resume/cover letters for spelling errors. I know that I read mine over and over and over again, since we all know grammar mistakes are the quickest way to get your job application sent to the trash.   So, here's what happened. It has been six months. I've been incredibly unsuccessful at landing a job, while Beth got one almost immediately. Even though I was unemployed, Beth helped me all the time, reading over my letters, sending out recommendations on my behalf, everything.   Well, guess what? Beth sabotaged me. In my cover letters, she snuck in a ""you're not really reading this, fuck you"" just smack dab in the middle of my letter. This was AFTER I had poured over every detail for spelling errors. Since I discovered this, I tried to confront her about it, and she has been avoiding me ever since.  Is there anything I can do? I have literally applied for HUNDREDS of positions, and I'm worried that I'm just permanently blacklisted. I'm so angry and so hurt.  **tl;dr** My friend, who was supposed to be helping me get a job, sabotaged me intentionally by sneaking in ""you're not really reading this, fuck you"". I haven't heard back from a single place because of this. What do I do?","I don't even know what to say to this one. That's a really shitty, nasty thing to do.  I'm ~~pretty sure there's no legal action~~ not sure if there's any legal action that can be taken, but the best thing you can do is try to repair your reputation. Do you have any other friends who work in the industry? If so, then start talking to them about jobs. You can explain what Beth did and see if any of them would be willing to go to bat for you.  You could also try contacting some of the places you applied to and apologize for the error - maybe explain that someone who was helping you apply to places altered your cover letters without your consent. You may never hear back from them, but it may give you some peace of mind.  In the future, never ever let someone send out cover letters/resumes on your behalf unless they're a headhunter or placement-type person. I'm not even sure if any of this is good advice, but you totally have my sympathies with this one :(",3001
4fe8c5,"When I was 19 and a sophmore in college I had a boyfriend I thought I really loved. Looking back maybe it was just teenage puppy love infatuation. Not sure but I guess it's not important. I need some advice because I know I'm very biased and what I want is what's best for my daughter but I think my feelings are getting in the way of that.  I had been with ""Tom""  for about 8 months at that point. He was on the baseball team and very popular.  But one day I discovered I was pregnant and told Tom. He freaked out and got super pissed. He demanded I get an abortion, said he would not stay with me otherwise. He did offer to pay the full expenses of it though. So I went to the clinic and...I couldn't do it. I'm very pro choice and told myself the logical thing to do would be to have an abortion. But when it came down to it...I just couldn't do it. I admit part of it was that I was afraid but I also felt an attachment for my baby. The thought of getting rid of him/her made me feel like throwing up. So I told Tom that I did love him and I wasn't trying to trap him but I simply couldn't have an abortion. Maybe we could look into adoption but abortion was out.  Tom said he had never loved me and while I was fun I was now causing him too much trouble for him to bother with me anymore and I was right, I wasn't going to trap him. He said I was free to choose to keep the baby and he was free to choose to have nothing to do with me or ""it"" and to not even think of trying to get child support from him. I won't go into details but Tom made it clear he would make life as miserable as possible for me if I tried to contact him again, get child support, etc. Maybe it was wrong to do but I figured all that trouble and drama just wasn't worth it and I would make my own way. I was, however, devastated and completely heartbroken. I admit it really fucked me up. I never spoke with or saw Tom again. I did consider adoption but in the end, long story short, I chose to keep my child. ""Faith"" is 4 now. It's been a long and hard road but I graduated college and got a job. We live in a tiny apartment and finances are tight but we make do. I love Faith like crazy and I do not regret the choice to keep her whatsoever. She makes me a better person and we have a good life. However three days ago I received a letter in the mail. It was from Tom. Inside the envelope was a letter and a check for $3000. This is what the letter said ""*(My name), I know this is coming out of nowhere and I'm sorry but I didn't know a better way to do this.* *I am so sorry for how I acted 5 years ago. I was selfish and a complete jerk. I know that doesn't begin to cover it. These past five years have really had an effect on me. I got a job at (blank). I started hanging out with different people. Good people instead of college jocks. I know I ran from my responsibility and I treated you  with callous cruelty.* *I know I can't undo what I did but I want to make it right. Here is a check for $3000 for Faith. I know that doesn't begin to cover what her expenditures have been but I wanted to show I am serious about what I'm about to say.* *I want to be a part of our daughter's life. I will go as slow as you like. I would very much like to set up regular child support payments as well as pay off whatever back child support I owe you for the past five years, including hospital appointments during your pregnancy. I know I don't deserve it, but I want to meet my daughter and be a part of her life in whatever way I can. I want to help her and I want to help you and start making up for the terrible way I acted.* *Here is my contact information. I am willing to do what you ask of me. Thank you for your time. Tom.* I was/am blown away. I'm also beyond pissed off. I'm thinking of the pregnancy I had to deal with after getting dumped like that. Exams and papers I had to write. Giving birth to her on my own. The late night feedings, all the diaper changes, the constant crying, trying to afford clothes to keep Faith warm during the winter as she grew while also making sure she didn't go hungry, the tantrums, the first steps, first words, the potty training. He wasn't there for ANY of that and now he just wants to come waltzing into her life like nothing happened after doing whatever he felt like now that Faith is out of the unfun baby years and she's a well behaved child who can now carry on a conversation and knows how to use toilet and doesn't wake up every two hours. Faith has started asking questions like where is her daddy, how come she doesn't have a daddy and I've been doing my best. I've been saying Mommy doesn't know where Daddy is (true until now) and she doesn't have a father because Daddy wasn't ready to be one when she was born. Maybe that's the wrong answer but I am doing my absolute best. I'm thinking of how Tom hurt me and bailed when life got hard. I can't stand the thought of him doing that to Faith. She's a sweetheart and quite sensitive. She doesn't understand unkindness, she makes friends with everyone and is very innocent. I've done my best to teach her to be a calm, kind, respectful person and everyone loves her. However I do know she needs a good male role model in her life and I do feel guilty for not having one for her. I haven't had a boyfriend or dated since Tom because all my energy and focus has been on graduating college, getting a job, and being a good mother to my daughter. I never really thought about Tom much after Faith was born but now that I am with this...intrusion into our lives I think I hate and despise him. I want him to just go away. I wanted to not even cash the check and to tell him to take his money and shove it but my parents and close friends reminded me that that is Faith's money and she is entitled to it and I agree. At minimum I want to get some child support going because Faith deserves all the financial assistance and opportunities she can get. However I know if I get regular child support Tom will want to be in Faith's life and frankly, I don't want that. I don't want him to hurt her and bail when life gets hard, because it IS when you have a kid. I also feel like he doesn't deserve her. 4 year olds are a lot more fun than infants. How convenient he suddenly shows up and wants to be a ""dad"" when the hardest part is out of the way. But. I honestly do want what's best for Faith. I think she deserves to have a GOOD daddy. I just don't think Tom is. I think Faith is better off having no dad than a bad or half assed one. She deserves the money. But am I right to take the money and not give Tom any access to my daughter?I can't stand the thought of him hurting her. The thought of dropping her off at his house where I don't have access to her makes me want to scream and run away. Please help me think clearly. Am I out of line for taking Tom's money but saying that's as close as he will ever get to her? I am not convinced in the slightest he has changed. I feel like this is guilt money and I want to throw that check in the trash. But it's Faith's money, not mine. Faith and I have a good life and I feel like Tom is going to ruin that. But is it right to keep Faith from her biological parent when he has sent the money? I hate feeling like I owe her him because of that. Please give me some advice and tough love if need be. I'm willing to listen if it's in the best interest of my daughter. **TL;DR College boyfriend dumped me after I got pregnant and threatened to ruin my life if I tried to talk to or get child support from him. Almost 5 years later I get a $3000 check in the mail and a letter apologizing for what he did and saying he wants to be a dad. I want to tell him to stay the hell away from us but I want what's best for my child. Advice?** EDIT: Since I have so many people asking, yes Tom is listed as the Father on the birth certificate","You have every right to be pissed. However, I think he has tried to sensitively approach you. People make mistakes, and he made a big one. 20 year olds are young and immature. It in no way justifies his actions, but he will have matured and changed since then. I don't think it's fair to assume he will do the same things now that he did then. I wouldn't let him meet Faith right away. But I think she has a right to know her father, Otherwise she will probably try and find him when she is older, and could resent you for keeping him from her if she finds out he tried to be involved. I would meet with him, let yourself know and trust him again. See if he actually pays child support for like 6 months and tries to build a relationship with you before introducing them. If he can do that, and puts in a real effort he might be allowed to slowly transition into your lives. It's ultimately your choice, and you definitely have every right to feel anger. But I dont think your feelings and emotions should dictate your daughters right to have a relationship with her biological father. He could be a changed man completely, and could from now on be a positive and wonderful addition to her life that she will be thankful for.",3392

That made us explain to people what's going on, and surprisingly people weren't all that bad. We lost about half of our friends, but others basically said its none of their business and they don't care. We underestimated some of our friends. We decided to cut off MIL and everyone who sided with her My SIL was the last person who I thought would come on our side but she did. She called and defended us and told us that she'll join us in cutting off her mother since this could have easily been her instead of her brother.  But I lost my job. Church basically had to let me go since people wanted me gone. So that also happened. I'm now looking for a new job. MIL also went to my FWB's place to confront him, he shut the door on her face and told her to fuck off.      **tl;dr**: MIL told everyone and I lost my job, friends split and we decided to cut off her and those who supported her. I'm looking for a new job now.","She actually went to your FWB's house!?!? Wow.  I actually think this went sorta well. Losing your job sucks, but the fact that you did lose your job because of your private, personal life means this wasn't the job for you. Now you know who your friends are (and that you still have friends!), you have a better relationship with SIL, and you can cut MIL out of your life with no more debate or guilt. So, congrats?",2006
4gf0t3,"Here's the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4g6d8c/i_30f_just_learned_my_husband_31m_has_feelings/) Hi, r/relationships. I know this update is coming fast, but I've made my decision and I thought you'd all like to know. A lot has happened in the past day, but in the end, I think I'm making the right choice. Tbh I think I knew this is what I had to do all along, but I was in denial. I want to start off by thanking everyone for their advice, kind words, and even tough love. I have decided to end our marriage and get a divorce ASAP. It's heartbreaking and painful for me to do this, but honestly, I don't think I could live with knowing my husband loves another woman *and* assaulted her in front of me. The fact that this is my SIL makes it even worse. I don't think we can come back from this and I would always feel like I wasn't his first choice.. plus, he touched and kissed Kate without her consent, which is an awful thing to do by itself. I sat down and really, *really* thought about what happened and how it made me feel. It made me feel disgusted, hurt, and angry. It made me feel like an idiot. It broke my heart. I couldn't believe the man I loved, the man I have been with for almost a decade of my life, would betray me and hurt me like this. It almost doesn't feel real. To think we were going to have kids, to think I trusted him and gave him all the love I could. It fucking hurts. A lot of you suggested that maybe he married me so he could be close to Kate. We sat down last night, I showed him your comments, and he broke down. He admitted to me that yes, he did marry me to be closer to her. It's always been her. From day one of our relationship, it's been a ploy to stay close to Kate. Not only is this devastating to me, but it's extremely creepy and I feel bad that Kate ever had to be around Jack. His intentions were almost predatory.. who knows what he would have done to Kate if her husband and I hadn't been there to intervene. I honestly think he would have done some truly horrible things to her, given the chance. He begged me to stay. He promised he loved me, he could get over Kate, he wanted me. I was his soulmate. We were meant to be together. He would go to therapy to work on his issues and we would be okay. He was sobbing and begging and trying to convince me to stay. I wasn't hearing it. I'm done. He's a liar.. he's been lying to me for years. He's creepy, horrible, and I can't live with him knowing what he did and how he truly feels. I called Charlie to talk to him about everything.. like always, he's here for me. He's incredibly pissed at Jack because of what Jack did to Kate. Kate is still shaken up and upset; she feels violated and her trust in Jack, someone she considered her friend for years, has been destroyed. Charlie told me that if I had chosen to stay with Jack, it was very likely our relationship would have died right then and there. Charlie told me he refused to talk to anybody who believed what Jack did to Kate (assaulted her) was okay or forgivable.. even if that somebody was me. He also thinks what Jack did to me for all these years is beyond cruel and he's angry about that, too.  I still have to contact a lawyer and get things in order. It's only been a day since I've made my decision.. but you were all so, so helpful to me. I can't begin to express how thankful I am for your comments. In the end, my brother and SIL are the people that matter most to me. They're my real family, the people who love me, and they're here to support me through this decision. I'm young, there's still hope for me to find someone who sincerely loves *me*, there's still hope of starting a family, there's still time left for all of that. I'd rather take my chances of finding someone new than staying with Jack. Thank you, again, for everything.  **EDIT/UPDATE #2**: Thanks for the condolences and kind words! It really means a lot to me. To address some concerns: * I will be extra careful and keep an eye out for anything Jack tries to do. Like many of you said, his obsession is unraveling, so he might do something drastic. I'm going to contact my lawyer ASAP to start seeing what I can do, change all of my passwords, get my bank accounts in order, etc. I have also **removed any information of my future whereabouts and plans** as some of you suggested. * I'm going to book an appointment with a therapist. I feel like it would benefit me and help me work through this whole thing. * Kate doesn't want to talk to/interact with Jack, but she is thinking about getting a restraining order. Understandably, she doesn't feel safe around Jack at all and would rather have nothing to do with him. She's also going to be extra careful, since she's the person of Jack's obsession and he'll probably try contacting her/doing something crazy. Charlie is there to protect her (he's a former Marine, 6'3"" and pretty dang intimidating), so I'm sure they'll both be okay. We're all here for each other. * Some people don't believe this is real because of my timeline (I said we've been together since HS in the last post, but then said ""almost a decade"" in this post). This was a mistake, I meant to type ""over a decade."" I can't prove the validity of my story, so you'll just have to take my word for it. I don't really feel the need to explain myself here. You either believe me or you don't. It's a bizarre situation. I can't explain Jack's behavior any better than you can. * On the bright side, Charlie and Kate are still trying for a baby, so there's a pretty good chance I'll be an aunt in the near future. There's still hope for me to find ""The One."" In the meantime, I'm going to focus on me, and moving on from this whole thing. Thanks for the concern and encouragement! :) TL;DR: Getting a divorce. Sad, scared, but hopeful. Thank you, Reddit.","I'm glad you were able to get some clarity from posting here.  Sometimes I think ""divorce!!"" gets thrown around a lot, but it was absolutely, totally warranted here.  I'm so sorry that you and your family have had your lives violated by this terrible man.  He has taken your love and trust and selfishly abused it. He's probably going to go into desperation mode very quickly, so make sure to secure a lawyer.  Not only that, get your personal papers, things like IDs, passport, birth certificate, etc and keep them safe.  A lawyer would have to tell you what's ""OK"" to do with joint resources, but I'd be keeping a close eye on the checking account as well.  Don't let him hurt you further.",1103
4go7no,"[Hi everyone, wanted to give an update to my last post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4eni4f/interviewer_made_a_comment_about_my_24f_facial/) Thank you so much to all of you who commented; you really helped me get some perspective. Looking back I was probably overreacting some because it was so personal to me. Before I do the update — a lot of people mentioned that they weren’t aware of how Tourette’s can manifest itself. I also got some PMs about it, so here is just a bit more information. Basically to be “qualified” for Tourette’s, you have to have multiple tics, both motor AND vocal. Funnily enough, although I had tics since around middle school, I only learned about Tourette’s through watching a South Park episode about it in my first year of college. So if you are interested in learning more (they give a great overview of the disorder) and also laughing a lot, I recommend you watch S11E08 of South Park, “Le Petit Tourette”. So on to the update — I had my interview on Tuesday when I made my post. On Friday afternoon, I got a call from HR; she asked me how the interview went. I wondered if something had been mentioned, so I said it went well except for this one awkward exchange, and I explained briefly what happened. She said she was sorry to hear abut the unpleasantness, but she was calling to let me know that every person I had met with had great things to say about me, and they unanimously voted to give me an offer. SO I got the job! It was a good offer with nice benefits. It’s not my dream job, though, and I was actually in the later stages with another position that I really, really wanted. I asked them if I could have a week to respond; they said yes. Yesterday, I got a call from this second company, and they gave me an offer too. The offer was a ton more money than the first one, like over 30% more, it’s the exact position I have been looking for for months, and it’s right by the beach! I of course accepted. I am ecstatic and will find a new apartment and start the new job in June, which is after my May wedding :) Thank you again for your kind words. I appreciate it. Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions about Tourette’s! tl;dr I got the job I had the awkward interview for. I got a great offer from another company with my dream job, which I accepted. I’ll be making lots more money, living at the beach, and getting married in less than a month!",You're amazing! Two job offers in a week is no small feat in these times. So happy for you! Enjoy all this excitement of a whole new chapter in life :-) Yay! ,1017
4gttnd,"[Here is the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4gklvc/my_23f_exs_25m_mom_40sf_shared_a_on_this_day/) I posted on Reddit a couple of days after I received the message from Krystal. After reading your comments, I agreed that I did not owe Krystal any response or action but I did think that sending a screenshot to Ross would be the best idea. If he had a problem with me being friends with him/keeping in touch with his family on social media, I would have no problem deleting them. To me, that should come from him, not her. So later that night, I sent Ross a screenshot of the message Krystal sent me and I added: ""Hey Ross. I received this message from Krystal a few days ago. Not sure what this is about, but if you have any issues with me being friends with you and/or your family on Facebook, just let me know and I will respect that. Thanks!"" I saw that he read the message a couple of hours later. He didn't respond that night but I got a message from him late the next morning. He said: ""throwxyz22, thanks for sending me that screenshot. I had no idea that Krystal messaged you and I want to apologize for her behavior. She was completely out of line in sending you that. I spoke with her yesterday after I saw your message and she got pretty defensive. She told me that she saw that my mom still has pictures of you in one of our photo albums and when she saw that my mom shared that memory of us on vacation, she got really insecure and took it out on you. She has never come to me and talked about it but I told her that there is nothing to worry about and both you and I have moved on. This upset her even more and she accused me of cheating and said she found a sex tape of us on my laptop and threatened to show it to my mom. At this point I just told her we're over. I think that yous should just block her on Facebook because she will probably try to take it out on you. You didn't do anything wrong. Sorry for bringing you into this mess lol but thank you for giving me the heads up... I dodged a bullet there."" So... that escalated quickly. For the record, Ross and I never made a sex tape. Any NSFW ones that we did make were deleted immediately after watching. I called him to firm that up and he assured me she didn't find anything, she was just using it as ammunition to try to get him to admit that he either 1. Had a NSFW video with me or 2. Was cheating on her with me. Not really much to say other than that! I've blocked her on all social media and haven't heard anything since. I hope she doesn't have my phone number, haha. Situations like these make me happy that I have chosen to stay single for a little while. Thanks for all of your advice Reddit :) It really helped! TL;DR: I told Ross about Krystal. She accused him of cheating and threatened him, so he broke up with her. I've blocked her on all social media now.","Good gravy, starts with insecurity over a FB post and ends with lying about a sex tape *and threatening to send it to someone's mother* Even if Ross was cheating, why the hell would you do that to someone's Mom?",1688

He flipped. He said that I was being selfish and inconsiderate by not letting him do anal. I kept thinking of all the kind words everyone left on the original post and didn't budge. This just made him angrier. He said there are plenty of prettier, sexier, and all around better girls that would be more than willing to give him what he wants. In fact, he had plans to meet up with a girl the next day. Admittedly, that stung, but I knew I couldn't give in. The responses to the previous post really opened my eyes.  So he stormed out in a fit of rage after I didn't give him what he wanted and I started gathering all his shit and putting it into garbage bags. I was running purely on fury at that point. I left his shit outside the door and locked it. I then sent him a text that only read ""In case there was any question, we're done."" I don't think I've ever been that pissed in my life. I can't thank everyone enough for helping me see how much of a harmful prick that guy was. You all saved me from enduring any more time of guilt and anxiety because of him. Lots of love to all of you. <3 tl;dr: broke up with my shitty manipulative boyfriend. I bought some cute lingerie for myself and have never felt so free.",So happy to hear your rid yourself of that pain in the ass.  Good work!,2833
4iczj7,"I live with my brother so we occasionally have dinner at my parents to see them and my little sister. I've missed a couple dinners and my brother brought up that I must've been with Brit, my second gf after my high school gf of 4 years and I broke up.  So, Brit has celiac disease along with alot of allergies and dietary restrictions. I know all her allergies, and the PDF of her allergies from her allergist spans about 5 pages. I even have a ""what to do"" PDF on my phone in case she goes into anaphylaxis. She even has asthma and a deviated septum so she has issues with breathing. My mom brings up that I've been missing dinners and suggests that I bring Brit to dinner one day so she can meet the family and catch up with me. I tell my mom about ALL her allergies, I even made suggestions on what she could cook for her. Basically told her, no to gluten, dairy, all kinds of peanuts, and alot of fruits. No one in my family has any allergies to anything but she said she'll take care of it for Brit and look up some recipes I suggested.  Eating out and making dinner for Brit is pretty tricky but I've assured her that she can enjoy all the food my mom is preparing. We get to my parents place and everyone's on the patio waiting for us. Brit has a place card next to my mom with a couple of burger buns and fries already in front of it so we assumed they're gluten free and specially made for her, that my mom didn't want to get them mixed up with everyone else's food. Brit had one bite before she looked at me in horror, and asked me to inject her with her epipen.  We're at the hospital and Brit doesn't even want me in the room because her symptoms included diarrhea and she's very self conscious about her hives. My dad texted me apologizing for my mom saying ""Sorry, she didn't realize the fries were cooked in peanut oil before they were packaged. She didn't know Brit was celiac -- you said no gluten, and who has THAT many allergies? Mom thought she was just very high maintenance.""  The last time Brit had an allergic reaction, it gave her such a horrible asthma attack she was hospitalized for 7 days. She's missing days of work by being in the hospital for observation. How do I let my mom know that this is unacceptable? Brit could've died so I'm not taking this shit lightly.      **tl;dr**: my mom didn't believe my gf had so many dietary restrictions, it's put my gf in the hospital","i have a theory, based on your dad's text saying, ""mom thought she was just very high maintenance""   your mom *specifically* put a place card with brit's name out; you didn't mention if she does this normally for dinners or if she had place cards for everyone else   your mom placed a portion of food *specifically* next to brit's place card, which is a logical assumption that they were ""safe"" foods **just for brit**; it wasn't platters of *all* the buns & fries for people to grab  your mom saying she thought brit was ""just high maintenance"" **+** brit's place card **+** ""safe"" food set next to it **=** your mom set a trap to ""catch"" brit ""lying"" about her allergies   your mom thought your gf was a lying liar dramallama stealing her son away from her dinners, and wanted to shame her  don't let your mom play stupid about this, she **deliberately physically harmed** your gf on the *off-chance* that your gf was lying about her allergies  ",6278
4isc42,"Hi, r/relationships! This is a repost because I messed up a few of the details + I posted this in the middle of the night and didn't get much of a response. My fiance: Charlie My sister: Kendall Kendall's boyfriend: Jack  **BACKGROUND INFO** Charlie and I have been together for six years and have lived together for three years. We met in college.

We've had normal sisterly arguments and whatnot, but I love her and she's family. I don't really know Jack that well, but he seemed like a nice guy (which obviously isn't the case), and we've all gotten along until now. Kendall and Jack have been together for two years. Their relationship is rocky; Kendall has called me countless times because of fights, breakups, and drama. I've always been her shoulder to cry on and I've supported her through everything as best I can.  She has gotten jealous of my relationship with Charlie, saying things like she wishes she could have a ""perfect"" relationship like ours and she wishes she could have that connection with Jack. Recently (within the last two months), she's started saying things like ""I should just steal Charlie from you"" and ""I wish Jack was more like Charlie, I think Charlie and I would be a great match."" She started flirting with Charlie (which made him super uncomfortable) and overstepped boundaries. I was uncomfortable and upset with her behavior, we had a serious talk and she broke down. She told me she was going through a rough patch with Jack and wasn't handling it well. She apologized (to me and to Charlie) and told me she knew what she did was wrong, it wouldn't happen again, etc. Charlie and I talked about it and we decided to forgive her. At the time of the incident, Jack and Kendall were still going through a rough patch. **THE INCIDENT** Two weeks ago, Charlie invited close friends and family to dinner (this included Jack and Kendall). It was at the restaurant Charlie and I had our first date, down to the exact table we sat at. We had talked about marriage (at great length), so I had a feeling. Lo and behold, Charlie proposed to me. It was perfect, I was so happy. I cried like a baby, lol. Our family and friends congratulated us. Kendall seemed super excited. She gushed about how cute it was, started talking about the wedding, and hugged us both.  The only person who didn't seem happy for us was Jack. He told Kendall that he wanted to go home and they left early. Fast forward a few days. Kendall texted me and she was pissed. She called me ""a dirty traitor"" and ""a disgusting cunt."" I was like wtf??? I asked her why she was upset. She claimed I was trying to ruin her relationship and then stopped replying to my texts. I texted Jack and asked him wtf was going on. He told me that he was planning to propose to Kendall at dinner. At first, I felt bad because maybe he had planned something beforehand and maybe it was just a huge misunderstanding. But apparently, Jack wasn't even planning to propose to Kendall until we got to the restaurant. He saw how nice the restaurant was, our friends and family were there, and decided ""hey, this is perfect."" He thought it would help them out of their rough patch (which is a horrible idea because marriage doesn't magically fix relationships), but then Charlie proposed and ""stole his thunder."" He didn't even have a ring! Charlie had been planning that proposal for *months*. He's had the ring for six months, made the reservations two months beforehand, invited all of our family and friends. Even the staff of the restaurant was in on the proposal! He put a lot of thought into it and I don't think Jack's heat of the moment decision to propose is more important than Charlie's carefully planned proposal. I'm actually upset that Jack would make something this special and important into something dramatic and all about him. I didn't apologize. Charlie and I talked about it, he agrees and doesn't think we should apologize. **THE AFTERMATH** Since then, Kendall and Jack haven't talked to us. Which is fine by itself, but that's not the end of it. Both of them have been shaming us on social media, twisting the story to make themselves look like victims, and have even coined us ""The Proposal Thieves.""  Mutual friends (and even some family!) are disgusted with us. They believe Jack and Kendall's story, even after I've tried to explain what really happened. As funny as it is to be called The Proposal Thieves, it's not so funny to have friends and family turned against you. I'm really upset that my own sister would do this. Charlie has been super supportive and sweet through this mess. We both agree that we shouldn't apologize and have been standing our ground.  Honestly, after everything Kendall has done, I'm pretty much fed up with her. She's my sister and I love her, but after she tried to seduce my boyfriend and now this, I don't really have a desire to talk to her anymore. Which sucks, because we've always been close. I think Jack has turned her into this horrible, self-absorbed person and it's just.. ugh.  Btw, I'm **not** talking to Kendall right now and have no plans to talk to her until we receive a sincere apology. Even then, I think I might limit contact if she stays with Jack. What do you think, Reddit? What should we do? How should we handle this? Advice/perspective/anything??? **EDIT**: Thank you for all of the advice! I will **definitely** post an update after we make our post explaining the situation. I really, really appreciate all of the help and support. It means a lot! :) I can't wait to see what a mess actually planning the wedding will be, lmao. See you guys in a week or two! **EDIT #2**: **JUST TO CLARIFY!** The people who believe Jack and Kendall's story are the ones who were **not** at the proposal dinner! A large amount of mutual friends who weren't there + extended family believe the story. Our parents, Charlie's siblings, and the few close friends that were actually at the dinner **do not** believe the bullshit story. We just haven't made a post addressing everything/telling our side of the story because we wanted advice on how to approach it (which is why I posted here). TL;DR: Sister and bf are upset that we ""upstaged them."" Spreading lies on social media. Everything is a mess, please help?  ","Write your version of the story. Post once, either on social media, or email the story to the friends that are upset. Emphasize the facts that: * Charlie arranged the dinner. * It was at your first date location down to the table. * He'd planned this for months. * Nobody's proposal was stolen, as Jack had literally told no one of his plans. * Mention that you are baffled at the way you are being portrayed. * Your family that was present can obviously corroborate all of this. Truth and sense have a way of cutting through all of the insane drama and lies that your sister is saying. You only have to say these things once. At which point, I think you should cut your sister and her boyfriend out of your lives and try to focus on your new life ahead. It's sad that your sister is so focused on her own misery that she's determined to destroy your happiness, but that's reality right now. And considering that reality, she has no place in your life.",3344

Long version: Thank you all for your comments. It helped me get from the sad and confused stage to the angry stage. The final straw was finding *his* post he made about half a year ago, talking about breaking up with me when I was in a very hurt and vulnerable state.  I then spent two nights at my sister's place to clear my head and told her about everything and she was shocked and disgusted and we talked for hours and it was all really freeing. I then decided to break it off with Jack. Jack and I lived together but the apartment was rented in his name, and I just always gave him my half of the rent. So I hired a moving truck and got all my important stuff when he was at work yesterday and left a note that said: Congratulations. Our relationship is now ~~open~~ over. I felt bad for not having the courage to tell him face to face but honestly, I just didn't even want to face him even for one minute.  He kept calling me non-stop yesterday and leaving lots of messages, some of them saying how much he misses me and loves me, some of them saying how glad he is that it's over and how he has been cheating on me for the past year. No idea if that's true. I'm staying at my sister's for now and looking for a new apartment. I'm still sad and angry but thinking about Jack coming home to a half empty apartment (without a bed, that one was mine) makes me smile. Thanks again, internet strangers, you really opened my eyes!  ","Good for you! On a side note, I find it hilarious that he thinks women would be lining up to provide him with BJs. ",1633
4jv6j1," Link to original post.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4joe9s/21f_should_i_confront_this_players_fianc%C3%A9/ First, I just wanted to say thank you to all that replied and sent me personal messages regarding this issue of mine. You all gave me the courage I needed to message her. After I made the original post I gave him one more opportunity to come clean to his fiancée. I confronted him and told him that the games had to stop. Either he told her or I did. He responded that I was bluffing, a bitch, and she wouldn't believe me. So I sent her the screenshots of our conversations, and my phone number. I told her to call me if she had any questions regarding what I sent her. The evidence was on my side, 90% of our recent conversation were filled with ""Are you sure you don't have a fiancée?"" and him denying it and calling her *crazy*, *obsessed*, and that she needed to *let go*.  I took a huge risk giving her my number. But the news I gave her needed to be discussed over the phone or in person. She called me an hour later. I expected her to be angry with me, possibly cuss me out. Call me a whore perhaps but she didn't. She cried for a long time and when she was able to speak she thanked me. We talked for awhile about their relationship and about how she caught him talking to another girl in the past but let that one slide for the sake of her childern. This apparently was the icing on the cake. She added me on Facebook and when she broke up with him she went on Facebook and wrote about how she almost made the biggest mistake of her life. She personally tagged me and thanked me again that status. Felt a little weird about that but I rolled with it. It wasn't two hours after that status was posted his messaged me and called me a stupid cunt. I was delusional and he never liked me. I ruined his relationship.. A load of bullshit. I sent her those messages and we laughed about it. We may have met through weird circumstances but I may have made a new friend. I don't regret telling her one bit, she seems like a wonderful person and she didn't deserve what he was doing to her. TL;DR Guy tried cheating with me. Sent screenshots to his fiancée, she was thankful that I told her. We bonded over his misery. EDIT: I hadn't even noticed that I misspelled  fiancée (On mobile) Please excuse that error.. LOL EDIT 2: I've replied to **most** of the comments. I did not predict that I would get so many responses. I made this update to inform the ones that commented on the previous post or read it that everything had went well.  Thank you all for your kind praise. I don't regret the decision at all. If anyone is ever in this situation it may feel scary but it's the BEST decision you'll ever make. I hope and pray this guy isn't stupid enough to try cheating on his future girlfriends. With the technology these days one way or another you're going to get caught. ","Oh, that poor lady! I really think you did the right thing though. Now she knows where she stands, and that lousy cheater is dumped.",1045

So I had quite a few update requests and it has been about 2 weeks since I posted. The day of my post I went over to his house that evening. I had scrapped together some cash to get him so groceries and dinner from his favorite place to lighten the mood. Because hey, I'm a giver.  Anyways, I walked in as I usually do and he was on his couch and in front of him was a brand new golf bag. I just set the groceries in the fridge and told him what I got us for dinner. He said ""I don't want it. I'm fine."" I was just brushed that comment off since I really wasn't wanting to argue with him. I asked him about his new golf bag and he had bought it with his club credit which made me soften up a little bit. So I sat down in the recliner across from him and started scribbling on my note pad a game plan for him/us with a budget for him and a way he can afford a car. I told him the game plan and he curtly said ""sounds good."" Then I went out into his backyard (he lives on BEAUTIFUL farm land with a nice deck outback) since I just didn't want to deal with him. And I just sat outside and cried. He came outside and started fiddling with some stuff in his yard and didn't say a word to me. He said ""So should I just plan on you not talking tonight?"" And then went on about how I have been such a source of disappointment for him financially. So I didn't say a word, took the groceries and dinner I bought and told him we are done. And left. I blocked his number and he is no longer a part of my life.  **tl;dr**: Walked out on his sorry ass. I dumped him.","He was a POS and you deserve so much better.

4k29ag,"My previous dog passed away last year. When I got him, I named him “Jasper” because he looked like a “Jasper”. When he passed away I was devastated. After several months, I got a new puppy and named him “Jasper”. I’ve grown attached to the name at this point.   My SIL just had a baby and named him “Jasper” as well. When she found out my dog’s name is also Jasper, she got really angry and upset. I’m not sure if it’s the hormones, but she completely overreacted and called me names. I got my puppy first and named him first. She never told anyone of possible names she was planning on for her son, so how was I supposed to know she was going to name her son the same name as my dog? I’m not sure what to do right now. She went on Facebook and ranted about it so most of my family knows about this mess. One of my cousins called me and laughed about it. It’s ridiculous right? I’m not a mind reader. How was I supposed to know she was going to name her son that? My parents love to see my puppy and they know that I named my puppy “Jasper” so she must not have told my parents or they could have warned her in advance.  I’m not sure what to do now. I won’t be changing my dog’s name as that name is significant to me so don’t suggest that. My brother hasn't visited me in the past year as we live 4 hours away from each other. So I don't think he knew that I named my new puppy ""Jasper"" again. Personally I also don't really see what's the big deal either. So what if they share the same name? It's not a big deal.     **tl;dr**: SIL is upset that she named her son the same name I gave my dog. ",Tell her the puppy is extremely honored. Edit: feeling honored myself; tyks!,5733
4ke30q,"My friend Lana is disabled in her legs, result of the accident when she was 14. So she's in a wheelchair. She also has movement issues in the rest of her body. We've known each other for a few years now, we met at the university and now we're both in grad school. I was her first real friend in her life as she puts it, as others have never been interested in friendship with her. As months and years went by we became closer, we did a lot of things together, we studied together and we were great friends. Her family are rather protective of her but they trust me completely with her. I never looked at her sexually, she was more like a cousin to me. I never considered dating her either. I really love spending time with her and being her best friend, the one that she trusts and can always rely on. Yesterday we submitted a major piece of coursework and we're finally free. I asked if she likes to celebrate. I picked her up and brought her to my place, we ordered pizza and had a few beers and enjoyed ourselves. The plan usually is that she takes my couch these nights as she often stays here (a lot of the times it's studying together though). Last night she was really intimate and kept holding my hand. One thing led to another, we were having sex on my bed. The sex was very good, but that level of intimacy with her was amazing, like something I had never experienced before in my life. After sex she laid on top of me and told me that this was her first time having sex and she's glad that it was with the right person. We slept in each other's arms. This morning I drove her home and when we arrived she kissed me and told me that she's glad that last night finally happened. I'm a little overwhelmed. On one hand I certainly love her and last night felt very right when it was happening, on the other hand I can't shake off this feeling of guilt that I'm having right now. I feel like she's been more or less isolated in her life because of her physical condition and I'm the first person who's really been her friend and she's opening up to me like that, not maybe because I'm the right one for her or that I deserve her but because I'm the only option. I feel like I'm taking advantage of her. I don't know what I should do. Are my thoughts valid?      **tl;dr**: Me with best friend who is disabled. We had sex and I feel like I took advantage of her because I'm her only close friend.","She's in love with you and you're in love with her, whether you know it or not. Don't let these feelings destroy the love you two have for each other. You say being intimate with her felt right, trust your instincts and let her trust hers. She trusts you. Her family trust you. It's not because you're her only friend, it's because you're a great friend and a trustworthy person. You deserve her. Don't overthink it.",3395
4kg7jb,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4iczj7/my_21m_gf_20f_is_in_the_hospital_because_my_mom/?ref=share&ref_source=link Thank you to everyone that took time to read the first post and gave me advice on how to deal with the situation. I received an overwhelming amount of responses and I've shared all the love and get well wishes with Brit.  So.. Tomorrow it will be two weeks since the horrendous dinner my mom (Dawn) hosted that landed Brit in the hospital for five days.  To clarify, Brit IS very cautious with what she eats but decided that it would make the wrong first impression if she had brought her own meal. We live in Canada and since I drove her to the hospital, the only expenses that would've needed to be paid would be prescriptions. If I had called an ambulance to transport her, she would've had to pay $385. I had no contact with my parents for a couple of days but my brother mediated what needed to be done in order to make this right with Brit. I made it clear that if no expenses/meds/bills were going to be paid off in full by my mother, she would expect I wouldn't be in attendance to dinner, holidays, birthdays or anything else.. ever. Brit's the kindest, sweetest, forgiving person I know. I suggested that we hire a lawyer to mediate and even sue my mother for assault but she laughed at the idea and told me that she was fine and to let it go.  The day before Brit got discharged, she received a list of all her new prescriptions so I had my brother take them to my parents to get and if they wanted to apologize formally they should bring it with them along with a cheque for a week's pay, a week of rent and no flowers as she's allergic to pollen. Our insurance covers 80% of everything but I did indeed make my mom pay me for the hospital drive as I'll be using it to buy Brit a Tiffany pendant she's been eyeing for a while since I'm still mortified.  My parents got to the hospital the day she was getting discharged. My dad pulled me outside her hospital room and I let Dawn speak to Brit alone. My dad did admit that the text he sent was not an apology but a half assed statement on behalf of my mom who was too embarrassed to speak on it. Brit and Dawn had a heart a heart, and Dawn sincerely apologized to her and gave her a cheque with almost $2000 and prepaid refills on all her prescriptions. Brit had asked why they didn't take allergies so seriously and just thought it was her watching her weight or being picky. So they spoke of my ex gf (who Brit used to take dance classes with) and how she refused to eat anything with gluten, counted calories, and only had low fat foods. Brit was so understanding and laughed it off. The Tiffany&Co pendant I was planning on buying her was also given to her and Dawn had even told her I had hid it at their house and was supposed to give it to her after dinner until she had a reaction. Tiffany&Co also has an allergy charm and that was also gifted to her as well and she can engrave a few of her allergies on it. Dawn has even bought Brit, her, my dad and I cooking classes so we can make gluten/dairy/peanut free safely in our homes and we'll be taking a class all together tomorrow. We won't be letting Dawn cook dinner for a while, so we'll be dining in a restaurant tomorrow night. **tl;dr**: Brit's made a recovery, my parents have sincerely apologized and reimbursed her for missing work hours, prescriptions,  and rent ","That's a nice, solid apology.",2675
4kyqqe,"I have an identical twin sister Jessi and we look very much alike. There are small differences but only those who know both of us can recognize them.  BF and I have been together for a year. Things are good between us. Last night this happened: my boyfriend's mom went out with her friends to watch a movie and Jessi was there as well with her boyfriend. After the movie one of her friends saw Jessi with her boyfriend. She asked her if that girl is her son's boyfriend (I met this friend at a party a few weeks ago). So she looked at Jessi and thought yes, she is. She went to her and asked what the fuck is going on. Jessi was confused since she hadn't met her before, and she kept asking her what the fuck is this. At that point she was holding Jessi's arm and she told her to let her go and called her a crazy bitch. Eventually she told Jessi that she's cheating on her son and called her by my name, and Jessi told her that that's her twin sister. She slapped her across the face and told her to stop lying. Her friends then collected her and took her away. She then called my boyfriend and told him that she's found her girlfriend with another man. I was with my boyfriend at that time. He quickly got it that she must have seen Jessi so he told her and she hung up. She then left. I talked to Jessi, she didn't even apologize to her. After she found out what she's done, she just left. So my boyfriend talked to her again and an apology is not coming. She feels like she did nothing wrong and she was justified in whatever she did since I hadn't told her that I had a twin sister, so she's justified in harassing her like that and slapping her across the face. She said that she expects an apology for being called a crazy bitch. I'm really pissed at her for what she did and the least she can do is apologize to Jessi. We were planning to visit my boyfriend's parents this weekend but now I'm not sure that I want to go. I can't just sit there and tell her how cute it was that she mistook me with my twin. I sure as hell don't think Jessi should go and apologize to her. Should I let this go? Am I overreacting to consider this a deal breaker? **tl;dr**: Boyfriend's mother attacked and slapped my twin sister across the face because she thought she's me and that I was cheating. Now she doesn't apologize. I want to cut off contacts with her, am I overreacting?","Your sister should report the assault to the cops, she was assaulted which should not go unpunished.  I would also stay away from any family gathering until she profusely apologises to your sister.

4lf8vk,"[Link to the original thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kird3/i_27_f_want_to_propose_to_my_boyfriend_27_m_of/) First off, my thanks to all those lovely people that replied to my original thread.  I never expected so many comments for my fairly insignificant issue. Anyway. I went ahead and did it. Monday evening, it was just the two of us at my place, pretty much like any other night when he slept over. Except when I 'accidentally' had my phone slip from my hand and got off the couch to get it so that I could get on one knee and propose to Peter.  He was at a loss for words. Then he started laughing. Then he left the room for a second while I was looking confused, still on one knee and with the ring in my hand.  When he came back, he got down on the floor with me and asked me the same thing, with a ring in his hand! I don't doubt we looked very silly when we both started laughing. Then we tried to put the rings on each other's fingers at the same time, which led to some more silly shit, but all in all, it was great.  Apparently, he'd been carrying the ring with him for the past five months. He wanted to originally propose for New Years eve, but didn't manage to get the ring in time, so he waited for another shot at it. The rest of the evening went perfect!  Yeah, we had to throw out the food left on the table in the morning, but hey, the night before was totally worth it!  I waited until Wednesday, so we could both get out the news to our families and friends that we were now officially engaged to be married, before I hit him up with my gift. We talked a lot on it, and eventually he asked me to for a few days to process it, as it was a fairly big deal to answer to in the moment. I made sure that he knew that I didn't give a damn about whether he got the degree or not, and if he wanted, I could give him a full language course as an alternative gift, or even for us to travel and stay abroad for several months so he could immerse himself in another language completely.  We were spending the night over at his place yesterday and he gave me his answer regarding the gift. While he was really, really appreciative to the lengths I'd go to help him fulfill one of his dreams from his youth, he said that ultimately it was just something of a passing fancy back then and even now, with all the expenses paid for, he didn't really want it or need it. One of the primary reasons why he didn't want to go and officially study at a university is that he thought that would probably prove taxing on our relationship and he didn't want that. Studying another language is all neat and good, but not at the expense of the life we've built together or the life we would have in the future.  The language course idea was also neat, he said, but in the end he thinks it would be more enjoyable for the both of us if we took that extended trip abroad. That said, I don't think we'll be doing all that much for learning the lagnuage. Mind you, won't bother me none :)    So that's it then, folks. No 4 years of studying, no delays on the wedding. Come this winter, Peter will be my husband and I'll be his wife! God, my head's still up in the clouds and there's a part of me that can't really believe this is happening. I've never been more happy!  To all the galls and fellas from the previous thread, again, my thanks!  **tl;dr: I proposed, he proposed back, we both said yes! He declined my offer of fully paid tuition fees for studying at university and the language course idea, and said he would much rather spend time with me abroad, just the two of us!

4lko2j,"Thank you all. My OP from two weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j12or/both_our_parents_50s_have_abandoned_my_21m_sister/ So besides reassuring her verbally continuously, making sure we do a lot of things together and being a good brother, I needed to get her into therapy and I found the right therapist for her. She's a psychologist who specializes in children's issues after divorce. The only problem was money. I called both my parents and told them that I need to talk to them (separately) and told them that we need more money as she needs to get therapy and I want to do nice things for her and that's the least they owe us after everything. They were hesitant but eventually agreed. I'm now getting $500 more each month from my mother and $750 more from father and that is a real help. When we have extra money from what my parents give us I put it in a college fund for her and this extra money means that not only she can see a great therapist but now I can save more for her. I also talked to a lawyer as a lot of you suggested to make sure we're getting the right amount of money and it seems that we do. Of course we could go on and get them to court and make everything happen through the legal system but that has the risk of them choosing to end my guardianship and get my sister back which is not the right thing for her. She's much safer and better off here than in their hands. Obviously the option is on the table if they decide to stop paying or reduce the amount. And a couple of you suggested we do something symbolic which I liked a lot. So I bought two matching necklaces and had them engrave our names on them and told my sister that we're doing to wear these to remind ourselves that each of us will always be there for the other and we can count on each other. We've already been to two sessions of therapy and I think things are good. The necklace has worked and she doesn't even want to take it off when she takes a shower.     **tl;dr**: I got her into therapy and got parents to pay for it. We're doing fun things together more often and we bought matching necklace with our names engraved to remind ourselves that we'll always be there for each other.","I missed your original post, but man, I have to say: your parents are the worst.

4lyc9a,"Yes reddit, I know how hilarious this sounds and I promise you this is not a joke as I am genuinely freaking out right now. I am soon finishing up secondary school (high school) and I'm looking for my very first job for the summer, so when I was filling out my resumé I didn't have a lot of experience to mention so I decided to do a hobbies and passions section, taking advice from others. I (stupidly) left my laptop out on the kitchen table today while I went to the shop to get some tea, and my gobshite of a sister thought it would be the joke of the century to delete my hobbies & passions section and replace everything with a single bullet point saying ""garlic bread"". Now, I had closed the Word Document, saving it, before leaving. She opened it, changed it without telling me, and saved it and closed it before I came back. She knows bloody well that I'm looking for jobs at the moment and she knew I'd spent the afternoon working on my resumé. I came home with the tea anyway and since I was happy with my resumé (I didn't bother to recheck it, I had no idea someone would change it to ""garlic bread"" while I was gone) I sent it to multiple job applications from an online hiring site, which had places hiring in my town. I'd say I sent this garlic bread resume to about twenty to thirty institutions in total. It was only after I sent them that I decided to re-check my resumé, when I noticed the horrific alteration. I am absolutely mortified. I immediately confronted my sister about it, getting a strong sixth sense that she was the most likely culprit, and she thought it was fucking hilarious. She literally laughed until she cried while I was standing there nearly crying from stress and mortification. My sister has always been a joker and she gets away with bloody murder, but this was so serious. I am sick of her pulling off this shite to everyone around her, thinking it's funny or cool or something. It was only when I explained to her the full seriousness of the situation, and that I had sent it to 20/30 places, that she copped on and apologized. Not sure if she was being genuine but the words ""I'm sorry"" definitely left her mouth. Then she had the audacity to blame me for it, asking me why I hadn't checked it before sending it off. I screamed at her that I had checked it multiple times before leaving to get tea, and didn't expect anyone else to change it while I was gone. She then back-pedaled and insisted that she meant it as a joke, like ""just a prank brah"" mentality but I'm having none of it. I don't know what the hell to do now and rectify the situation. I have never job hunted before, I don't know how serious this stupid mistake is. I live in a large enough Irish town but small enough for businesses to spread gossip, so I'm terrified that they'll all now know not to hire the ""garlic bread"" girl. Should I email the places I applied to explaining the situation, or will I sound like a complete knob? Technically, it IS true that garlic bread is a passion of mine simply because it's delicious, but obviously it is not resumé-worthy. The businesses probably think I'm taking the piss and it's extremely unprofessional. I'm so annoyed that this is my first impression in the working world, I'm not even hired and I've fucked up already. Should I resend them my application with my resumé fixed? Should I move on and forget about the places I applied and apply to new businesses with a rectified resumé? Should I just fucking move town at this point since I've clearly made a fool of myself already? Also, how do I talk to my parents or sister about her stupid spoilt bratty behavior?      TL;DR: My little sister changed my hobbies and passions section on my resumé to ""garlic bread"" as a joke and I sent it out to about 20/30 business in my town unknowingly. I have no idea how to fix this.",Only give your sister garlic bread for Christmas and birthdays (it is your passion after all) until she makes it up to you.,2921
4m0gq3,"Original Post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lubms/my_21f_with_my_boyfriend_24m_he_wants_me_to_cut/] Hi everyone.  First of all, as I said in my edit on my original post I want to thank everyone who offered advice and support. I was amazed at the huge response I got, and while I couldn't reply to every comment I did read all of them.  After R texted me, I replied to him asking if he had known my BF to behave like this with other girls in the past.  Over the course of many texts it came out that he often yelled at and belittled his previous girlfriend in front of others, and some of his friends and family had suspicions about how far he was taking it.  After the break up, the girlfriend posted some stuff on Facebook about how BF had hit her, said awful things to her and did other things like spying on her and deleting people from her phone behind her back.  Initially when this happened R and his parents questioned BF, but he insisted that the physical abuse accusations where not true and that his EX was saying those things to cover up the fact that she had allegedly cheated on him. BF admitted to yelling at her but he told his family that she did the same and just as often.  His family eventually accepted that, but R and his parents were always wary of BFs behaviour and R in particular had made a point to keep an eye on things.  BFs ex apparently had also called R around 6 months after myself and BF had gotten together and asked him to help me if anything happened. At the time R was not quite ready to believe BF would physically abused anyone, but he told her all the same that he would watch out for me or any other girl in the future.  R told me that after the way he saw BF behave at my party he became more convinced that BF was likely to get physical and that was why he chose to step in. He also told me that even if it didn't go that far, I should not put up with how BF treated me.   I agreed, what R had told me, and all the information and support I recieved here had me pretty convinced that I was not in a good situation. I decided to go and stay with R and his roommates for a short time.  I don't have too many other options for accomodation this urgently. My parents live too far away and the few friends I could stay with are other girls with enough on their plate, and I didn't want to risk bringing this drama to their doorsteps. In retrospect I'm glad I chose to go to R's, because I feel like what followed could have been even more frightening and dangerous if only myself and another girl had been present.  I didn't have much time to get my stuff together before BF was due to arrive home, so I packed a few bags of essentials and valuables, along with my school things, and R picked me up.  I left a note at the house for BF I was leaving and that I did not plan on returning, other than to retrieve the rest of my things. I didn't tell him where I would be staying and that I would rather he didn't contact me directly, suggesting he communicate through his mother instead.   I got to R's and got settled in, while choosing to leave was difficult and I had a few bouts of crying, I also felt immensely relieved.  R/BFs parents came around and brought some dinner. They were incredibly nice about everything and told me I had to do what was best for me. We always got along well but I never expected them to be so kind and supportive given the situation. Half way through dinner, my phone rang. It was BF. I did not want to answer it and everyone else agreed that was probably a good idea. After my phone rang out, R/BFs Mum's phone began to ring. Predictably enough it was BF calling. His dad answered the phone, the phone was not on speaker but BF was loud enough that you could hear him yelling down the phone.  I couldn't tell exactly what was said, but his dad was telling him to calm down, and not to do something. BF hung up on him, and R/BF's dad told us BF was coming to R's place, and saying this was all R's fault.  R started to get a bunch of text messages from BF making threats and telling R that he knew I was there and ha was coming to get me. R replied to him saying that if BF came here and caused trouble he would be calling the police, but BF ignored him.   BF showed up at R's probably 15 minutes later. He drove up the lawn and almost hit the letterbox, and got out of his car and started yelling. R and his dad went out while I stayed in the front room with his Mum. BF yelled for a while and was kicking at random parts of the garden.  BF started to yell towards the house that he knew I was there and to come out. I wasn't planning on coming out at all and R told him to leave.  BF ended up running around the side of the house to the back patio entry, the screen door was locked but the solid back door wasn't, and he started hitting the fly wire trying to break it. He kept yelling into the house that he knew I was there and that if I didn't come out, he would destroy all my stuff and log on to my school accounts and cause problems on there.  R and his dad caught up to BF and started pulling him away from the door, BF started throwing punches and his Mum and I both went out to the inside of the back door, because we were worried someone would get hurt.  BF saw me and started trying for the back door again, and saying if I didn't get in the car he would kill himself. His mum said she was going to call the police.  BF/R's dad ended up hauling him out to the front yard and told him to leave.  BF did eventually get into the car, he spun his wheels and tore up the grass and drove off.  I felt pretty awful after all that. His mum and dad were both visibly really upset and R's rental property had been messed up and I felt responsible, they were still so nice about everything though. They really are wonderful people.  I spoke to the police and they said they would be speaking to BF about what happened and I got some advice about obtaining a VRO and making sure I could find away of retrieving my stuff from the house, so that is all ok for the moment.  The latest news is that BF has been all over Facebook saying that R and I had been having an affair and posting all these random cropped blurry porn pictures from the Internet saying it was us, and that he had caught us in the act. None of us are responding to any of it at this point, haven't really decided what to do there.   My plan is to stay with R for now. It's still my best option and R has said he won't leave me alone at the house in case BF comes back. Either he or his male roomate would be there, we also spoke to a couple of the neighbours that R is friendly with and they said they would keep an eye out for his car or call us if they saw anything dodgy.  I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do next. I'm planning to talk to my uni about getting in to student housing, I'm planning to go out tomorrow to buy some pepper spray also. I'm tossing up about reaching out to BFs ex, but I'm not sure if that will cause more problems for everyone.   So I suppose that's it, for now at least? I'm sorry that this was a bit of a novel- but I know a lot of people wanted an update and considering how nice everyone has been I wouldn't want anyone to worry that I had gone back/stayed with him. Rest assured that is totally out of the question, the more I think about things that happened within our relationship with this new perspective, the more I realise how fucked up some of those things were.   Again a huge thank you to everyone, I'll do my best to keep up with the comments and respond to any PMs       **tl;dr** left BF, staying at R's. Lawn traumatised as a result ","your ex's family sound like great people. I am glad that they are supporting you and you are safe before he got a chance to get physically violent against you, which would have happened eventually if you stayed. Maybe you can file for a restraining order against your ex.",2061
4muwka,"[Here is the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lvz0t/my_25f_professor_30m_asked_me_to_go_on_a_date/) Hi everyone! I just wanted to thank you all for your comments on my last post :) They really helped me. I was asked for an update so here we go... Anyways, I think I should have worded myself better. I wrote the post on May 30th and my convocation was on June 4th. I put ""next month"" in the title but realistically, I should have put ""next week."" I digress. Looking back, the timeline is probably confusing but this post should clear it up. First and foremost, I GOT A JOB :) It is at quite a large PR firm within the city and I start next week. They didn't ask me for references, but instead, told me they looked at my LinkedIn profile and saw that I had quite a few recommendations there, so they were satisfied with that. I'm so excited!! So I never ended up using Mark's letter of recommendation. After posting, I decided that I do want to explore something romantic with him. I immediately felt better after getting some third party advice, so the next day, I emailed him (I didn't have his phone number) and said this: ""Mark, First off, I want to say that I am incredibly grateful for the recommendation letter you compiled for me. I have a second interview tomorrow at one of the agencies I was telling you about. I'm a bit anxious but also quite excited.  I just wanted to let you know that I will not be using the letter after all. I thought about what you asked me and I am very interested in going out to dinner with you. You have been an awesome mentor this last semester but I am ready to see a different side of you. I promise we don't have to get Indian food :) I wanted to apologize if I seemed standoffish when you asked me; I wasn't expecting it and it took me a while to process it all.  Again, thank you for the letter. Maybe I will see you at convocation this Saturday? And, just in case you may want it, here's my number 555-555-5555. "" (The Indian food  bit was from when he was sick one day and said he is 99% sure he got food poisoning from trying a butter chicken dish at a dive bar) Anyways, I received a text from him an hour later and we have been talking ever since. On Friday, I found out I got the job and told him. He said he wasn't surprised and I would do really well there. Saturday was my convocation. My parents flew down and it was great! I saw Mark at the mixer and he had a huge grin on his face and waved. I was busy taking photos and whatnot and noticed he left later on. He told me he didn't want to spoil my day and said we would talk soon. We decided to go out to dinner yesterday (Sunday). To keep it short, it was great, he was great and he walked me back to my condo. We said goodnight and he started walking away. I was kind of disappointed and turned to walk into the door but I heard him call my name and he kissed me :) He said he's still new at this. Anyways this post was probably all over the place but I'm actually just feeling really giddy and excited. Between the new job, finally graduating and the lovely date I had with my ex-super-hot-prof, I'm on cloud nine right now. Thanks for everything guys! Your advice really helped!     TLDR: Got a new job, graduated and went on a date with Mark. He's a good kisser. I'm happy.",What a respectful-sounding guy.,1711
4nulgv,"original : tl;dr:Im in love for the first time in my life with my friend, Im not sure what to do as I always thought I was asexual https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lumdd/i_26m_suffer_from_aspergers_and_thought_i_was/  After a lot of thinking I decided I wanted to give it a shot. I was still scared I might lose her friendship but if she was with someone else because I never said anything I would probably regret not saying much more.   We were watching another episode of game of thrones which we do weekly.  I was planning on just telling her I like her after you guys advised against the ""love you"" but it also made it hard for me to articulate my feelings  Instead I listed all the things she does that I think makes her unique and awesome. At some point I mumbled that even though she was extremely messy and disorganized she was capable of anything and everything. She looked a little worried  ""if you were my doc Id think you were about to deliver my death sentence why are you being nice, you never compliment anyone, are you feeling okay, dont freak me out"" she started touching my forehead for my temperature and since I was nervous as fuck I was a tomato probably over heating. You could probably cook an egg on my face.   I suck so I ended up blurting out ""I think Im in love with you"". yeah I realized I F up and said ""no I mean like, like you""   She went from worried to confused to humored. She stared at me for a while and this just made it worse as I could tell she was smiling but I wasn't sure if she was laughing at my stupidity or what. She teased me for a bit as to ""which is it, like or love ?"". I said I didn't want to scare her so she can pick which ever she liked. Yeah ....   So I started back tracking and said she could ignore everything and started apologizing for making her feel uncomfortable. Thats when she told me to shut up. I dont remember what I was saying but she later told me that I was talking 100k/h and she couldn't make sense of.   But she she said she likes me too!!!. We didn't kiss even though I really really wanted to but I couldnt get myself to do it. We cuddled instead and talked.   We've been hanging out every day since then doing pretty silly things. Last night we decided to spend the entire day/night in the city rather than go home. We laid on the grass and just talked/cuddled.   I told her I was going to kiss her when it was 5 am. don't ask. So we talked till 5 and she reminded me it was 5. So we started this really awkward thing where I kept telling her I'm going to kiss you really really soon but couldn't go for it and kept repeating myself. But then she moved closer and well I went for it. it was just a peck but it was still awesome. She started giggling and I kissed her again. She continued giggling and I told her unless she stopped giggling that I wasn't going to stop kissing her and she laughed harder so I went for more than a peck. It was/is one of the most amazing feelings Ive ever felt. We kissed the entire morning. She said she couldnt control the laughter because she was nervous too, she laughs when shes nervous. So she wasn't laughing at me.    So yeah, I think its safe to say Im not asexual.  Part of me felt sad that this was what I was missing out on all these years as nothing compares to it but the other part of me is really happy that it happened with Zara, shes truly amazing.   OW one last thing! she said she loves me too after the kiss, although she was worried about saying it too early.       **tl;dr**: I ended up blurting that I love her, she said she likes me back we kissed.

4oacaq,"**[Original post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4infj1/me_36f_with_my_ex_boyfriend_36m_of_over_10_years/) - tl;dr: I think my ex boyfriend is being emotionally manipulated by his wife who is alienating him from friends and family. I want to help him but don't know how.** Hi, even though my original post didn't get a lot of attention, there were some good responses and I thought I would update everyone as A LOT has happened in the last couple of weeks! So I forwarded her messages to my ex's brother Fred. He called me immediately and said that he would try to get a hold of his brother as soon as possible. I forgot to say in my earlier post but Bill works as an independent consultant/contractor in IT so it was hard getting a hold of him in his workplace. Frank received a few responses from Bill, just short emails saying he was ok, but Fred wasn't really buying it. Thankfully I hadn't received any more messages from Fiona (I didn't reply to any of her emails so I guess she gave up on me). I didn't think there was much more that anyone could do so just got on with looking after my own family. My husband (let's call him Dan) knew that I was worried about my ex, and as a testament to what a great guy he is he set about trying to contact him as they both work in the same field of IT (I know apparently I have a very specialized 'type' lol). Dan is close to his boss and told him about the situation. Dan's boss contacted Bill through Linkedin to set up a Skype ""consult"". Dan's reasoning is that if Fiona is monitoring Bill's emails and social media then this will fly under her radar as she doesn't know Dan's boss and his connection to us. My husband is a sneaky clever bastard. They scheduled the call a day later and my husband hopped onto the call as well. He didn't tell me exactly what he said, but the gist of it is that Dan and his boss told Bill that we were all worried about him and that if he needed help to just let us know. Bill broke down and started crying. He felt so helpless and thought that no one cared about him. Turns out she was reading all his emails and deleted all the ones from his family as well as controlling all the finances. She was also physically assaulting him and was too embarrassed to tell anyone (she's just shy of 5 foot, he's 6'4''). Dan and his boss told him to pack his bags and head to the airport and they bought him a one way ticket back home! Bill arrived home a week or so ago and he's doing well. He's staying with his mother and father and Fred has been helping him get back on his feet and handle the legal stuff. Needless to say they are extremely grateful to my husband and his boss and have paid back the cost of the ticket as well as buying Dan and his boss several bottles of very expensive bourbon (which they insisted on, we were happy to cover the ticket but weren't going to argue with them). Dan and I told them that now he's home we were going to take a step back. His family is looking after him now and they don't need our help anymore we'll still keep in touch though and I think we'll always be close to Bill and his family from now on. Fred did tell me that she doesn't want to come back home so we don't have to worry about her turning up on our doorstep. I don't know how Fiona reacted (she hasn't sent me any emails so I don't think she knows I was involved) or what's going to happen legally because I don't want to be so involved anymore. It's time we focused on our family for a bit because I'M PREGNANT! Couldn't have picked a better man to breed with. Also, Dan's boss let Dan bill the hours of Bill's rescue as ""personal development"" because there are still decent people in the world. **tl;dr: My instincts were right, Bill was being abused emotionally and physically by his crazy (now ex) wife. My husband and his boss staged an intervention under the guise of work and bought Bill a plane ticket home. Bill's doing fine. He's going to counselling and everyone is giving him lots of support. My husband and I had fun times and now I'm knocked up.**      ",Its so great to hear a situation where so many people stepped in to help-while keeping good boundaries.  You don't see a lot of that in this sub. congrats on the little one. I hope you have an easy pregnancy.,596
4ou08h,"What really happened: I was very sick four years ago and was in need of a liver transplant. My situation was that it was very unlikely that I would get one in time. At that time my sister was pregnant. I didn't know as it was early (less than two months). My situation was getting worse and my sister decided to do an abortion and then two months later we did the transplant surgery. I never knew about the pregnancy. All I knew was that she gave me half of her liver. My sister and her husband divorced a year later. I didn't know the truth until yesterday when my mom slipped up about an abortion that my sister had. I asked her about it and she told me everything. She told me that my sister made her promise not to tell me and she failed that promise. My sister was very happy. My brother in law was a very decent guy. I knew they were looking forward to having children. They were great together. She always told us about how lucky she is to have found him. Apparently at the time of their decision, my sister and her husband had great disagreement. He didn't want her to have the abortion and risk the transplant surgery and was hopeful that my situation might sort itself out without my sister's help. The chance was very small but it was there. My sister didn't agree. They couldn't convince one another and my sister did things anyway without his blessing. They tried working things out after the surgery, they went to counseling, they even tried to have another baby but they couldn't get themselves to do it. He couldn't forgive my sister and she wasn't all that apologetic so they ended up separating and eventually divorcing. My sister isn't happy now. Hasn't been since the surgery. She never told me the real reason for her divorce. She told me that they were after different things. I just learned things from my mom. I asked my mom if my sister still thinks that she did the right thing. She said ""she's not sure"". I can't stop feeling guilty. My sister saved my life but destroyed her own life doing it. She had to abort the baby she definitely loved and looked forward to and did that knowing that it will probably end her marriage as well. I was ready to go at that time. I had accepted my fate and I was at peace. She should have just let me. Shit. My brother in law should have told me so I would have talked her out of it. I'm surprised he didn't. I can't feel anything but to hate myself. I don't know what to do. Should I talk to my sister? What should I tell her? Should I keep my mouth shut and pretend that I don't know? I'm not sure if I'll even be able to look into her eyes and not show that I know. I just don't know what the fuck I should do. Please please help me. **tl;dr**: My sister did an abortion be able to give me part of her liver and saved my life, but it costed her marriage. ","Your sister did the right thing, and you should be proud of her, and feel so lucky to have a sister like her. Put yourself in her shoes. You have a sister who is *dying*, with very little chance of surviving if she doesn't get the liver she needs. You just got pregnant - hooray! But you're the only person who can save your sister's life, and it will cost you the pregnancy. Damn. But you can get pregnant again. 75% of pregnancies end in miscarriages, most of the time without the mother even knowing, and few of those women are rendered infertile by it. So you know that, while it's sad, you can always try again for another baby - but if you let your sister die, you'll never have another sister again. Easy decision, right? Except you've got a husband, and he's actually telling you that you should roll the dice, almost certainly watch your own sister die in a hospital, just because he wants *this* particular fetus, who is not a person, to take priority over your living, breathing sister - even though there's *nothing* preventing him from making another, even though losing a child in early pregnancy is common as it is. So you've got this man, who is basically telling you to *kill* your own sister or he'll leave you. You know what? *Fuck that guy*. In her shoes, would you ever pick a man like that over your own sister? If you had let your sister die when you could have saved her, would you ever be able to forgive yourself? She did the right thing - for you, *and* for herself. If it was me, I would tell her that I know - without throwing Mom under the bus too much - and I would thank her for giving me my *life*. She's been keeping this from you the whole time because she doesn't want you to feel guilty - and the consequence for her is that she hasn't been able to talk to you about any of it. Thank her. Let her cry on your shoulder. Let her know that you truly owe her your life, and that you are the luckiest sister on the planet. Mourn the pregnancy, mourn the marriage, don't talk bad about the ex. But know in your heart of hearts that that man wasn't good for her, and that he could never have raised children who would be so closely bonded as you and your sister are. Edit for a couple clarifications: - I was way off on my claim about how many pregnancies fail to complete. Read the comment chain for a very good breakdown of *exactly* how wrong I am. - I was being a little flip when I implied that anything about terminating a pregnancy would be an easy decision, and I apologize for that.",2699
4pa53z,"Link to the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4knk8d/my_31f_husbands_32m_mother_60sf_has_alzheimers_he/)' Hi everyone, I wanted to post an update since so many people requested one in the first post. I know it's been quite some time, but a lot has happened and it finally calmed down enough that I could find the time to post. Good news, husband's mom is now in an appropriate home. We were able to find a place about an hour drive from where we live that was $7k a month and that had pretty great reviews. We obviously toured it first and talked to the staff and asked extensively about activities, cleaning schedules, food, etc. Mother-in-law was moved in this week. We were really lucky, because of our location there wasn't a long waiting list and there were several openings this month alone. It also helped we had a strong referral from her long time physician (the one who actually told us about this place to begin with). So basically what happened after that post- I called Mike and told him we needed to talk when he got home. When he got in we sat in my study and I laid it out for him. I told him exactly how I felt about the situation, told him it was enough. I showed him some printouts of information I had on Alzheimer units surrounding us, even articles on coping with having a parent going through this.  Long story short- we got into an argument. He accused me of being unsupportive, being selfish, etc. I refused to take it. I have been the one to stay home and babysit his increasingly sick mother all day, not him. I told him that and that if he was so dedicated to having her stay in the house, *he* could be the one to take care of her. I was at the absolute limit.  I packed a bag and checked myself into one of the nicer hotels. I went out and bought some bath bombs and wine and for the first time in a long time I just had time for me. I was able to sit on my laptop and actually get ahead on my work. He was of course texting me and calling but it was just to continue his tirade, which I could happily ignore for the time being. I knew that he would soon be seeing things in a much different light. It seriously took only two days. He begged me to come home. He told me he was sorry and that he didn't know just how bad it was. I told him he'd have to do better than that and to actually take her to the doctors and get that referral so we could have her moved to long-term care ASAP. Make an appointment at a home. Start prepping her for the move. Until then, I wasn't checking out of my newly found peace and quiet. He actually came through. Her physician, a really really great guy btw who also had a parent go through this, got us fast tracked for this place. I think that paired with Mike seeing his moms actions really helped to open his eyes to the reality of the situation. She wasn't just ""a little off"". She was actually a danger to herself.  I also talked to my husband about getting therapy. I told him it would be normal to have feelings of guilt or sadness over this and that I thought he should take the time to see someone. I offered to go with him if he wanted me to be there. He said he would think about it and I decided not to push it. I will take it up with him again though if I see he's not doing well because of it. He cried a lot the day we had to take her in. When we got home we had a long talk about how he felt and he told me he was sorry he said I was selfish or uncaring. He said he realized how much I must have cared to do that for him for 3 months. I told him it doesn't mean someone doesn't care when they have to just admit they can't handle something. There are professionals for a reason, we're just not them.  So that's where we're at right now. This week is more about everything settling down, him getting used to his mom being away, me getting the house back to normal and getting back into routine. I've left her belongings in the room she was occupying so he could still have that piece of her and we could bring things to her as necessary. They gave us a list of clothing items needed, but it was mostly comfortable housewear like pjs and slippers and since it's not winter yet nothing bulky like sweaters or coats. I had to have the mattress replaced in her room though because she had wet the bed often and not said anything so it was destroyed. I cleaned up her bathroom and just tidied the room up in general so it was livable again.  I want to say thanks to everyone who weighed in. So much good advice and words I much needed to hear in that original thread. Thank you to everyone who shared their personal story and gave their suggestions on how to help husband cope. Hopefully from here on out things can be a lot more stable. It's definitely not easy and I wish that in a perfect world none of this would have to be happening, but it already feels so much better this way.        **tl;dr**: My husband finally saw the light and we moved his mom to an appropriate Alzheimer unit where she will get the assistance she needs. Husband and I reconciled, I am making sure to be very supportive of him during this hard time. I put the option of therapy out there for him, but will let him decide on his own. Thank you all so much for your help. ","Just want to add something small: Yes, comfortable pajama like clothes are ideal, but DO NOT only supply her with pajamas. Nice shirts and soft slacks are good as well. I can't tell you how many residents I have that have only a few nightgowns or other pajamas items. Seriously, if her laundry is done at the facility and she runs out, she'll need to wear the Johnny's the facility has. They usually are about 10 sizes too big and are not warm.",1341
4pn07j,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dh3b3/my_best_friend_22f_of_16_years_who_has_never/  The previous from my first post **TL;DR:** my best friend of 16 years who has never shown interest in me shows up at my college apartment one day and randomly has sex with me. She's been coming over pretty much every other day since the semester started. I've liked her for years but she won't give a definitive reason as to what this means or where it's going and it's scares me. Despite most people including many of my closest friends telling me to just end things with her or force her into a decision, I decided to just ride it out accepting that I'd probably get tossed to the side when someone better came around for her.  We went on to be FWB for about 4 months and those were honestly the most nerve-racking months of my life never knowing when or if it was going to end or what she was really thinking. I tried my best to play it off as if it didn't bother me but really it was a bitter-sweet time for me. After our school semester ended we drifted a part a little bit, we both were spending time with family and friends. We both had extremely busy semesters and spent most of the time studying or with one another so it was expected.  She ended up going on vacation with her parents to visit her grandparents in England. She did invite me to come along months ago but I already had other obligations so I couldn't go with her despite wanting to.  We did talk on the phone a few times while she was away, I actually had annual soccer tournament with my traveling team and we met this all girl's team at the tournament that I was telling her about it since she plays soccer as well.  She seemed happy for me that I was having fun but I could tell that it was bothering her I just chalked it up to maybe I sounded like I was bragging or something. Two weeks later she asks me if I can pick her up from the airport because she flew back early and she nearly knocks me over she hugs me so tightly. She never shown so much intimacy in public before she even tells me that she really missed me.  It's like 8pm and we go to Starbucks she's being like really different, a lot quieter than normal and she seems a little nervous around me like she wants to say something. Eventually she confesses that she realizes that she does like me as more than just a friend and she apologizes for her unfairness making me wait so long before giving me an answer.  She tells me that before she left she didn't really know what she wanted, she didn't know if she wanted a relationship or if she was ready to be in one. She said that she was afraid to get into a relationship with me only to realize that she didn't want it and feared that our friendship would be never bounce back. She told me that she experienced a lot of things in England and was sad that she wasn't able to experience them together. She talked to her older sister who lives in England who really put in some good words for me.  So we're officially dating and everything has been awesome, couldn't be happier. Sorry if this update is bit lacking, I tried to summarize three weeks worth into this post without making it a novel. But if you have any questions about anything just let me know. Thanks for the advice on the original post really gave me some solid perspective. **TL;DR:** We're finally dating and everything is great. I guess it pays to be patient sometimes. We'll be celebrating our first month on the 1st of July. ","I'm happy for you! I'm glad you waited it out, it seems like every post on relationships has a hoard of people saying break up no matter what the scenario is. Congrats ",600
4potyb,"original post is here, https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26pydf/my_bf_m25_wont_ask_for_my_hand_and_my_dad_m48_is/ The wedding went on as planned.  My parents stuck to their guns and boycotted.  One of my two sisters attended and is now happily blacklisted from our family.  Nobody else from my entire family showed up including my two brothers. The wedding was a little unconventional.  My sister walked my husband down the aisle and then his sister walked me down the aisle.  I wanted this because my SIL actually introduced us and helped me get my first date with him.  There was no questioned about who gives away the bride or even about objections.  It was normal other than that.  There has been no contact between me and my family, other than my one sister.  My mother has made it a point to send me a card every time that they have a family gathering for holidays or birthdays at their house to let me know that my father says I'm not invited.  I get one almost every month.  I don't even read them anymore I just toss them.  I don't why they keep sending them because I've made no effort to contact them and I live over three hours away so it's not like I will run into them by accident. The reason I came back to post this here is because some people here made a prediction that came true (that they would come crawling back when we had children).  I am now expecting our first child, a girl :).  She will be the first grandchild for my parents.  My parents found out about the pregnancy a few months ago through a family friend.   They didn't waste anytime in making demands, not requests, demands.  My boyfriend and I are not religious but I had a Catholic upbringing.  I don't practice at all by choice.  My mother called me back in April telling me that my father wanted our daughter's middle name to be his mother's first name.  I said no.  My father was listening in on speaker so I went ahead and told them that they were officially uninvited from all birthdays, graduations, and any other important dates in her life.  My father called me half an hour later crying and begging me to come stay with them for the birth so my mother could care for me.  I said no. He also said that he had already made arrangements for his priest could baptize her at his church but that I needed to agree to naming her after his mother if I wanted this to happen.  He said he'd already planned a big celebration for the birth and the baptism that he was paying for.  I said no to all of it.  He went from meekly trying to sweet talk me to raising his voice at me and I hung up. He called a couple of more times to apologize for losing his temper and again beg me to reconsider giving birth at a hospital near them so they could visit us.  He denied having any knowledge of my mother sending me cards to uninvite us to any family functions and even said that he specifically asked her to invite us but he was told I declined every time.   He lets my mom do the dirty work so he can later hide behind her and deny he had any knowledge.  He's done this since I was a little girl.  He does this every time he wants to drop the hammer on somebody but be the good cop also. He'll never change.  He denied having any knowledge of why anybody in the family missed my wedding.   I told him our daughter would not be baptized, or catholic at all (no offense to Catholics).  I told him he was too manipulative and controlling and I didn't want my daughter exposed to that.  He's too toxic and just venomous. Coincidentally, the day and for several days after that phone call I got tons of calls and emails from my brothers, their wives, my sister, and all my aunts.  They all wanted to apologize for missing my wedding, and all had specific excuses, and wanted to make plans to be there for my daughter's birth.  I banned them all from her life until she's old enough to decide for herself to let them in. My husband was a little surprised and not sure about banning everybody forever.  He's more leaning towards supervised visits if they want to drive to us.  My dad has been calling him like crazy but we are a united front.  My husband is deferring to me but giving me ideas as to how I can give a little if I decide to.  But with my family there's no giving a little.  They want it all.  For now, they're all banned.  I will reconsider when the youngest of our children turns 18 :).  For now my dad will have to settle for sucking up to my husband while I stick to my guns.  Unlike him, I don't mind owning my decisions even if it means I'm bad cop.  I'm not ready to give up a relatively drama free, stress free life to allow my dad and all his sheep back into our lives.      **tl;dr**: Nobody in my family showed up to our wedding other than one of my sisters.  Everyone is banned from our lives.",Wow your parents have a lot of nerve! They want you to give birth at a hospital convenient to them! They think you'd trust them to look after you.  >My mother has made it a point to send me a card every time that they have a family gathering for holidays or birthdays at their house to let me know that my father says I'm not invited. I get one almost every month. This is frankly amazing that she'd go to that effort.,2680
4qmevo,"Link to old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qfpn2/my_39_m_wife_30_f_of_6_years_is_upset_i_lost/ Thank you everyone for your posts and advice. I really appreciate it! I made a few realizations about myself and my relationship to my wife. I wasn't easing my wife into getting into a healthy lifestyle and had completely forgot that when I started out, I took it very slow. It took me 4 years to get to where I am now, and my wife was trying to keep up with my current lifestyle, which can definitely be overwhelming.  I was trying to look for the perfect opportunity to talk about this with my wife, and to ease the mood a little, I went and bought her favorite bottle of wine and a bouquet. I went to talk to her in our bedroom after our son had gone to sleep, and she had these old photo albums. Apparently she had stopped by her parents place after work to help them with some summer cleaning, and she wanted to keep the photo album to go through their memories. I gave her the flowers and opened the wine and we looked through the pictures while we were cuddling.  We were leafing through the pictures, and then I saw one of a strikingly handsome man in a football uniform holding a girl that looked exactly like my wife when she was 24 kissing him. My wife was so interested in the picture, and she started tearing up a bit. I asked her what was wrong, and she pulled out her phone and showed me a picture of her parents now. They're in their 60's, and still in love, but they have lost their shape that they had in their youth. Her dad had a really large beer gut, and her mom was overweight, but they were happy.  She was saying that when we got married, she was hoping we would be like them. They never worried about losing faith in one another because their attractiveness faded as they grew older, but their love for one another continued to grow. She talked about her old boyfriend, who became so popular in college, and girls threw themselves at him, that he ended up straying; she was worried the same would happen to me because women in the neighborhood started to talk and say they wish their husbands worked on their bodies like I did. She was starting to feel really insecure. Then I took that opportunity. I gave her a kiss, and then told her that she loved me when I was fat, and women like them never noticed me. She still loves me, but those women just lust. Sure, my eyes might dart, it is physically natural, but I loved her so much, valued our relationship so much, and only needed her in my bed, I couldn't even imagine laying with another woman besides her. She started crying tears of joy, and I didn't stop there. I pushed on wards. I grabbed the picture of her parents from college, the picture she had of her parents now, and a picture of when we started dating on my phone. I told her what her parents did, lose track of their health but still grow old and love each other is one way to live life. They got the chance to see their grand kids, but I know the health problems her parents have. Then I brought up my dad, and how he wasn't able to spend much time with his grandson, and how I want to have the opportunity to see my future grandkids and maybe even great-grandkids. I said I wanted her to be by my side. I took a picture of us now, and had the picture of her parents, and said, ""Why can't this be us when we're in our 40's, 50's, 60's, till we die?""  I told her I loved her, but because I loved her so much, I wanted her to become healthy. She doesn't need to get to her pre-baby weight, or anything drastic. I told her my story of how I just wanted to get fit, but then that developed into a desire to look good, too. She admitted that she also wanted to get back her health, and at the same time she was hoping to stick to her new years resolution to lose 20 lbs. We talked, set up a plan, so she is cutting the snacks down to two cookies a day and logging everything she eats, and portion control. That was when she brought up her monthly appointment with her psychiatrist. Apparently she had been going to talk about how she could get over her overeating habits. I felt so bad. I had neglected my wife when I was trying to become healthy, when I could have included her in my journey and it would have been so much easier to do together. We set up an exercise schedule every day, and she was joking how we should have sex every day to make sure we got our cardio in. I took the in, and we had sex the rest of the night. I haven't been as intimate with my wife like I was last night since our honeymoon. I hope to keep the momentum going tonight since we both took vacation for the long weekend ;) I took the advice of being more intimate with my wife even outside the bedroom, and was kissing her and playing around with her while we were making breakfast today, when I hear a voice shout from upstairs ""DADDY! YOU SAID WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH GIRLS LIKE THAT!"" Ended up having the ""When a man and a woman are married, and love each other so much, it is ok to do that, because that is what leads to a baby"" conversation today. I can still see the shock in his eyes... but it had to happen so I can feel more comfortable kissing my wife and squeezing her butt in front of my son.  I am so glad my wife does not have depression and that we were able to work together to put a plan to get back her health. She was showing me pictures of power couples, saying in a year or two she wants to take a picture like that together, so I am so glad she has that goal in mind. I also feel ashamed. When I was starting, it was to become healthy, but I liked the physical changes I saw in my body. Then for my model, I picked Leonidas from 300. But my wife, who has restarted on her fitness journey, printed out this picture of a husband and wife who are both fit. It just goes to show who loves who more, and I definitely need to work on that.  Anyways, thank you so much for the support reddit. I really appreciate the help, and look forward to helping my wife with her journey, so that together we can live a long and wonderful life seeing our son grow older and his future kids.       **tl;dr**: Got some wine, saw some pictures of healthy/fit couples, decided we can do it together. Starting a plan slow with moderate diet changes, 3x exercise a week, and lots more sex for cardio. Scarred my son for life because he knows that maybe girls don't have koodies because his role model is grabbing his mom's butt in front of him. ","Well, dang, that's a happy ending, and it's good to see that you all worked this out to a conclusion where you both will be happy and secure in your relationship. Side note: one day, show your son the picture about romantic love where it says ""I will buy you tacos and touch your butt."" I have no doubt hilarity will ensue.",1096
4qxomu,"Hi guys - it's been about a month since I posted and even though my issue wasn't too popular, I've gotten some requests for updates. [Here's the link to the original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4k5icd/me_30_f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_15_years_i/) So, I brought up a lot of the points that you guys brought up in the last thread, including: ""How would you feel if I stopped working?"" and I actually threw out an ultimatum of ""If you had to choose between getting a job and being with me, which would it be?"" I wish I could tell you I took the calm, rational, mature route and just walked out to a new life.  I decided to have a tiny bit of fun instead. I've got a decent amount of money saved up since his dad didn't charge me rent and that was the entire purpose of me staying here (please note: I prefer to carry my own weight and still contributed as far as preparing meals, buying food and buying drinks!).  I put my notice in at my previous job without informing my boyfriend. Once the notice period was up, I started staying home. Every. Day. Wake up in the morning and he says ""...don't you have work today?"" and I'd be like ""Eh, I don't feel like it"".  The first few days he was like ""Awesome!"" and we sat around playing games. After the first week he starts getting a little anxious and he's like ""So...what's up with work?"" and I tell him ""Oh, y'know, just not feeling like it"".  After the second week he says ""What's going on?!"" and I tell him that I thought a lot about what he's said, and I really agree with him. I don't feel like working and contributing to ""the machine"" either, so I'll just stay here with him.   He FLIPPED OUT. He started telling me how irresponsible that is, how I have to work, basically the entire diatribe that I should have been screaming at this kid the entire time we were together. Except at me. Because I didn't go to work for 2 weeks. I kinda figured that would happen and I wanted something drastic to point out to him that, as I said before, he is a hypocrite. Because, he is! I have to admit a small part of me was kind of hoping this would be a revelation to him, and help him change. No, he just couldn't fathom how I could possibly do something so ridiculous and blah blah blah. Anyway. What I actually did after leaving my job was find a part time job and go down to the local community college to pull the trigger on something I've wanted to do for a couple years now: enroll in a welding program. I also found a roommate in the area who's cool with my animals, and that way I can split my bills up and not be strapped for cash. Plus I sometimes drive for Uber and this is an okay market with a decent bar scene on weekends, so if I need a little extra, there's that. So I've moved out and moved on, and y'know, I'm not even that sad because I got closure out of that whole event. I'm also pursuing the cliche of hitting the gym more/at all, and hoping to lose a little weight.  Though, I did just lose 180 useless pounds, so maybe that's enough for now. :p Anyway, I know I didn't go about it in the right way, but I thought if any of you were curious to know, here's how it went. Thanks Reddit!  **tl;dr**: The kid ain't alright and I GTFO'd. I am free to prey on the geeky men of Cleveland again. Edit: Sweet Jesus, this exploded, and you are all very kind and amazing! Lots of people PMing and commenting about his actual ""reaction"", but to be honest...I feel like I'd have to be a trained therapist to even figure it out. After he flipped out at me and I pointed out that it was really was just a ""what's good for the goose..."" scenario, he got kind of quiet and said I was being mean. I told him that it had become pretty obvious that tying to talk to him about everything wasn't doing me much good, so I had decided to actively show him.  He told me that it doesn't change anything about the way he feels about not working. I told him that he's got to find some way to contribute, or I walk.  He told me it would be my decision.  So, it was. Basically...to this day he still believes he's ""right"", or at the very least he hasn't done anything wrong. There's some sort of disconnect in his brain where he can't connect the part of him that loves me and wants to take care of me, with the part of him that doesn't want to work and wants to live off his parents forever. It's pretty sad, really.  ","OP this is awesome. I know lots of people say take the high road, don't play games etc., but we all dream of getting to do something like this before we walk out the door. You're a hero! And good luck with everything.

Almost all of you reassured me it was a date, which was good advice, because it totally was. We had brunch together and then went for a walk near the waterfront of our city. We had great chemistry, talking up a storm, but we hadn't entirely gotten ""date-y"" yet, I really wanted to hold her hand but I was too nervous. Then the fairly nice weather turned into a torrential downpour, and she invited me back to her place. We got stuck in the rain, but luckily, she didn't live too far. When we got back to her place, we were talking and I said ""By the way...I think you're really cute."" She said ""I think you are too...I'm just kind of anxious. I'm an anxious person."" We kind of looked at each other for a second and I said, ""So...do you wanna kiss?"" (I prefer to just ask these things.)  She said yes, and that kiss turned into a full-on makeout session which turned into some really amazing sex. At one point I said to her, before we actually started having sex, ""I really want to do this but I'm always worried that if I sleep with someone on the first date, they'll get the impression that I'm only in it for the sex, which isn't the case."" She basically told me not to worry, because she wasn't getting that impression. And then we had some seriously awesome sex. We're hanging out again Wednesday evening. I have this terrible tendency to get ten steps ahead of myself with these things, but we seem to have really amazing chemistry and I've really got a good feeling about this.    **tl;dr**: It was definitely a date. A date that went really, really well.",the wonders of direct communication!,789
4r354y,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46vjbn/i29m_broke_my_wife28fs_heart_how_do_i_save_my/ I had forgotten about this post and I am back to update so maybe seeing my stupidity could prevent someone else from making the same mistakes.  I cringe when I read today what I wrote months ago and it seems ridiculous to me that I could have felt this way about another woman. I wrote that I would imagine my former coworker while lying in bed but in the end when my wife stopped acknowledging my existence waking up without seeing her face was just absolute torture. I really took all I had for granted until I almost lost it So I took some of the advices and decided to court my wife again the hardest I could. Of course the first step was looking for another job, and it took me a month but I managed to find a similar position in another entreprise. I did what was suggested of taking over every chore and she stopped ignoring me but would simply stare at me with some kind of hostility and go on with her life. I tried flowers but she would leave them to die. My wife dominant love language is physical but I wouldn't dare try touching her so I went for telling her. I somehow realized it was really the content of what I wrote about the other woman which obviously when you are deep in a crush is amplified, that really hurt her. I tried engaging her in conversations so we could talk about what was happening to us but more importantly what I did to her but she remained closed off. And so I started writing her letters and would leave them under her pillow.  At first I apologized for everything, for writing the post, for not putting an end to the crush faster, for making her feel like another woman could hold a higher place of importance to me and for not taking the initiative to change jobs earlier. For making her life hard by creating this situation which ended in her sleeping in the guest room of her own house, for making her cry and causing stress to her.  Then I wrote her love letters telling her how much I loved her, how the crush couldn't compare to the deep love I have for her. I was chewed for saying I loved her because of our history in my last post but I was misunderstood. I meant that the love I have for her has gotten stronger with time. 5 years ago I loved her, but wouldn't have given her one of my organs if she needed for example while now I would without hesitation. Our history is what caused the attachement to grow stronger therefore no random crush could override that. I was awed in front of my crush and wrote sappy things about her but in the end I do not know this woman on a personal level while I have seen the worst of my wife and the love remains.  I told her how beautiful she was and how impressed and proud I was with her development as a person since we have met, how grateful I was for her presence in my life and every single thing I was thankful for that she did and enhanced my life, how much I needed her and missed hearing her tell me how her day went, laugh at my bad jokes and basically just missed hearing the sound of her voice. This is a small sample but it must have taken a good 3 weeks of daily letters until she answered me back. She answered with a letter of her own telling me how much I have hurt her with my crush, how I made her feel invisible next to that woman, how I never told her such loving words (until the letters) how much she hated me but also how she loved me and missed me too. Her letter allowed me to feel her vulnerability. After reading it I cried and went to see her, we locked eyes,she cried and we held each other for a long time. She started talking to me again then and softened. Honestly the possibility of the marriage ending just like that scared the both us.  As of today we are, to my surprise, mostly back to normal and actually I feel closer to her. We continue with the letters which have helped increasing our emotional intimacy. I make an effort to tell and show her my love. I am very grateful that she has given me a second chance and even more so that she has decided to put the crush behind us. We had maybe 2  fights since but she hasn't brought it up and doesn't punish me. It really wasn't the crush on itself but how I went about it and the lack of affection from my part in comparison.  Maybe I am being optimistic here but I truly think we are going to get through this. We will be going to couple counselling after our vacation just to make sure things are really settled between us.       **tl;dr**: I managed to get my wife back after working on the way I conveyed love to her and we are doing alright.","Yeah buddy. Save the letters, and when you have a fight, or you forget how much you love her, you break that shit out and remind yourself. ",1752
4r6euw,"Posting this in personal issues because so far it feels more like a personal issue to me.  Yesterday afternoon I came home from work early because I wasn't feeling well. I assumed my husband Jake (5 years married) was at work still because it was early in the day. I went upstairs to our bedroom to take a nap and I caught him trying to stuff my diary back into its hiding place. Shocked, I asked him what he was doing. at first he said nothing and he was cleaning our room and found it and was about to put it back. but he was fidgety and I knew he was lying. I pressed on it more and asked if he was really reading my diary, like seriously...?, and I felt so weird saying that. It reminded me of the time my mom ready my diary when I was 13 and I caught her. I felt like a kid all over again with my privacy being invaded and being secretly judged.  Eventually he admitted that yes he had been reading it. I was hurt and still am. My diary is sacred to me and always has been. It's the one place I feel I can truly open up and be myself. I questioned him even more about it and he admitted he'd been doing this consistently for three years. He said he started doing it after my dad died because he was worried about me. The time was rough for me sure but I wasn't depressed. It was my dads time to go after a long battle with cancer and I knew it was coming. I don't think my behavior changed drastically enough to warrant my husband to invade my privacy and read my diary.  He said once he got started he couldn't stop it and it was addicting. He even admitted to have some pages photocopied. on the photocopied pages he would make notes and draw question marks. I noticed one or two of the question marks were drawn around entries and paragraphs where I talk about going out with my friends or seeing my family. I asked him why on earth he would draw question marks around that. Did he not trust me? I was so confused. He then deflected and snatched the booklet with the photocopies from my hand and said that I should not be so upset about this. Husbands and wives should share everything and I shouldn't be so antsy about my diary unless I had things to hide from him. He said that he feels he has a right to look at it as my husband and that he's just concerned about me.  My thing is, he invaded my privacy. I'm my own person apart from him... Arent I? I really like having a place to be myself completely... I can't even have that? I'm already going to quit my job soon to make him happy so I can stay home with our future kids. I've already given up a lot of my life since I got married. I don't see some of my friends because Jake says I now have marital responsibilities and I can't be attached to single life anymore. I gave up my favorite hobby of hiking because Jake said it was dangerous. I don't know. I'm just getting sad writing this. Writing in my diary was one of the only things I had left and now it's been taken from me. I've been so sad I can't even process it.  I don't know reddit. Sometimes I feel like a shell of my former self in this marriage. But I feel like I'm overreacting and I'm sure that's what you're thinking right now. Sometimes I just lay in bed and cry and wonder if this Is all there is in the world. I used to have so many friends and hobbies and I feel like since getting married things have changed so much. My home has become a place that only makes me sad and tired and feel gray and weak and pessimistic inside and even cold to the point where I just lay in bed with blankets over me. Nothing to do every single day but wait. Wait for Jake. Wait for work. Wait for bed time. Wait for food. Wait for my hot baths. Wait for when I can lay down for hours with no one looking. Not even enough strength to get up and go for a walk or do something productive.  I can't decide if it's my marriage or if I'm depressed. I don't know how I truly feel yet about this diary thing. I feel like my privacy has been extremely invaded. It just makes me sad more than anything and Jake won't even apologize to me. He says I am being dramatic and silly and that I just need a good nap and I'll be okay. That he's just doing what is best for me and that he always will do just that and take care of me and make sure I never have to lift a finger in this world or have a job or go anywhere but the comfort of our home that he bought for us.. He wants me to stay home for fourth of July and not go anywhere and rest instead. I wish I could just go outside and walk in a straight line and never look back.  I just needed to vent I guess. If you have any advice I'd appreciate it. Would you consider this a major breech of privacy or no big deal? Do you think I'm depressed ? :(       **tl;dr**: my husband has been reading my diary and more than anything I am just filled with sadness and regret.

4sb2ja,"Hi! Thank you all for your advice. What a stressful situation. Here's a quick update.  Link to the original-https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rihvk/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_serenaded_his_coworker/  After everything I was really pissed all of last week and was sort of planning on breaking up with him but I was taking my time making the decision because, well, break ups suck and it wasn't something I was looking forward to. I mentioned in the comments of my last post that I own a house that has been sitting vacant since I moved in with my boyfriend and it doesn't have a kitchen right now because I moved out in the middle of renovating it. I have a friend that owns a kitchen company so I asked him to come out to the house to look at it and draw up plans. He told me he would do it at cost without charging for labor and ever since I told my boyfriend that he's like ""what, are you fucking him? But how many blow jobs is it costing you?"" I work for the FD so obviously I work with a lot of (good looking) guys and he's just been so jealous lately, especially last week, trying to tell me who I can and can't talk to while at work. So, all that to say, it was definitely time for us to break up anyways. I just can't believe that he is giving me such a hard time but thinks him serenading this girl right in front of me was ok.   I did look at a text he got that makes me think they were hooking up. I spent Thursday night out at a hotel with friends for a birthday and came home in the morning. He had a text on his phone that said something like ""omg noooo I was sleeping"" so I read through their conversation (which was conveniently deleted except for two messages) and he had texted her at 3am to see if she was awake. Maybe I'm reaching, but every time a guy has texted me that late it's been to hook up. That sealed the deal for me so I just left, it wasn't even worth fighting over because for a whole week now I've been pretty much done with him anyways. He didn't take it that well, which was surprising because it sure seemed like he wanted to break up, but whatever, it's done now.   **tl;dr**: I broke up with him. ","Usually that jealousy and lack of trust stems from a party knowing that you shouldn't trust them, so they assume that they canw trust you. You can't *talk* to attractive coworkers but he can serenade a woman in a pool, practically in front of your face... the details in your post were like icing on the cake. Who wouldn't be thrilled about you getting a new kitchen on the cheap!? That blowjob comment, blegh. Glad his character surfaced strong at the end and you got him out of the picture.",1613

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r1j71/i_31f_realised_i_recently_have_feelings_for_a/ So Last Thursday Jim took me out for dinner. He came to pick me up and I was still super nervous, even though by that time I was pretty sure it was a date. He opened the door of the taxi for me, but I went to go around the other side, thinking he was just getting in the car! He looked really confused until I figured out that he was being a gentleman and we both ended up laughing about it. It kind of broke the ice as he seemed a little nervous too. We went for cocktails, then for dinner. Despite my insistence, he paid for everything and it was just perfect. We were chatting for hours and before we knew it, they were closing up around us. Jim walked me to my taxi and kissed me goodbye. My stomach flipped over and I felt like a teenager - I couldn't stop grinning on the way home and fell asleep with a stupid smile on my face. The next morning, I woke to find a text from him telling me how much he'd enjoyed our date and that he'd like to see me again soon. I couldn't wait either, so invited him over for dinner that Friday evening. He didn't leave until Sunday lunchtime. :-) **tl;dr**: It was a date. We are now dating and I feel like I've won the lottery. :-)",">I couldn't wait either, so invited him over for dinner that Friday evening. He didn't leave until Sunday lunchtime. :-) Holy shit, girl.

He called me just to chat this evening, and told me all about his trip but how excited he is to see me again. As we were talking, I realized I really like this guy and suddenly I felt this weight falling onto my shoulders. I had to tell him. So I told him about 30 minutes ago over the phone. First he laughed, and thought I was joking about being pregnant. Once he realized I was serious, he got quiet, but kindly asked me to just run him through the logistics of what was going to happen and what it was going to do to me. He was genuinely concerned for me and my wellbeing, and kept saying how thankful he was that I told him. He said he'd be there for me through the whole process, and that I don't need to worry about it changing anything between us. He was rather impressed by my matter-of-fact and practical approach to the matter- and that I had the appointment and funds covered without even talking to him. I honestly think this just showed me that he is a really good guy and wants what is best for me. He seemed to appreciate my maturity and mostly appreciated me telling him. Thanks so much to everyone who encouraged me to do this. It was 100% the right decision, and I feel even more sure about a possible relationship/future together! Edit: Wow this blew up! Thank you SO much everyone for the thoughtful comments and advice. I feel much more at ease about the situation and am thankful for all of your words. **tl;dr**: Called Mike, he was very understanding and nice about the situation. I feel relieved!","This is great, but ideally I do think he should have offered to chip in to cover some of the cost, even if your mom is prepared to pay. It's the principle, it takes two people to get someone pregnant, you're both responsible for what happened and he should pay at least half.",2030
4tsr73,"Thank you so much to everyone who commented on my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44zp5v/i_34f_turned_to_my_husband_34m_for_support_after/) earlier this year! We got into counseling not too long after that post and have been continuing every week ever since.  We just had a session yesterday.  Our counselor is wonderful, she really understands the situation and has identified the struggle my husband faces when confronted with an uncomfortable topic, like our losses, stress at work, the decision to have children or not, and more. We have spent quite a long time discussing my husband's upbringing.  His family isn't really big on communicating, and there are many problems that he and his siblings have had over the years (and continue to this day) that were never addressed and never resolved.  In session he talked about how he felt his emotional needs were never really met growing up, but that he didn't realize it until now.  It made me really sad for him.  We had his parents over a few weeks ago and as usual, the conversation remained really superficial and never delved into anything very substantial.  I have tried to share with them about our life and our losses before, but there's never been any sign of interest from them in connecting with us in that way, even though his mother is one of the only people I know in my life who has suffered a loss as well.  We spent the next week's session processing their visit, and unfortunately my husband felt a lot of anger and frustration that he wasn't able to talk to them about the important stuff. However, in our relationship things have completely transformed.  We argue so much less, and he is completely present and there for me when I need his support.  The topic of having children has come back up, and we are still figuring that out, but we can really talk about it and be open and honest with each other without fear and with respect and open arms for each other.  He has repeatedly said that he's really happy we got into therapy and that he feels great about the state of our relationship.  I'm almost happy we've gone through such hard times so that we were able to hit rock bottom and get to this wonderful place. So, thank you to everyone for your kindness and generosity in following our journey.   TL;DR: Poor communicator husband and I started therapy and now our relationship has completely transformed.  Thank you to everyone!",I'm so happy it's working out for you guys! I remember reading your first post ,384
4upxcr,"So my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tia40/i_30m_made_a_huge_mistakeoversight_and_really/) didn't get a lot of attention, but I did get a bunch of hurtful truths that I needed to hear, and some good advice. I figured now that the honeymoon is over I should probably do an update. The TL;DR version was that through a huge error, I accidentally left my cousin Molly out of the invites for my rehearsal dinner, while inviting all of my other cousins, making me and asshole, and hurting her feelings. Anyways, on to the update. I was still trying to figure out how to apologize to Molly for my oversight and make it up to her. I had pretty much decided to grovel at her feet, and had planned to give up my plate at the rehearsal so she could come and eat and not be left out, and was bouncing ideas off of my fiancee on maybe taking Molly out for lunch a few times after we got back from our honeymoon, because I really did want to repair the relationship. Anyways, I was out running some last minute errands on Wednesday (had to pick up the tux) and when I came home, I found my fiancee sitting on the sofa, chatting with Molly like they were old friends. (They had only met on Monday at the family get-together my parents threw.) My fiancee (let's call her Emily) stood up and said ""So I told Molly the truth about the rehearsal dinner, and that when I was going through the guest list to bring the numbers down, I didn't recognize her name, and didn't realize she was your cousin."" Emily had gone behind my back, called Molly and invited her over to explain why she didn't get an invitation, took the blame and told her how bad I felt when I realized it the other day. She even told Molly the truth about me planning on inviting her anyways and giving up my plate, because I didn't want to hurt our relationship. She had apparently also called the venue and (in her own words) ""went bridezilla"" to get Molly a seat. (Emily is the most chill person I've ever met, so her going anything-zilla must have been huge, and I'm almost sorry I missed it.) She also invited Molly to go with her and her bridesmaids when they went to go get their hair/nails done as an apology for ""her screwup."" Guys, if I didn't already have a whole wedding planned, I would have eloped with her on the spot. Molly gave me a hug and told me she appreciated me being willing to give up my plate at my own rehearsal dinner, but to ""quit being such a whiner"" and enjoy my wedding. So the rehearsal and brunch went great, and I was really glad to have the whole family there, and was finally able to enjoy myself. Molly didn't end up going with Emily and her bridal party because she didn't want to intrude, but was grateful for the invitation. The wedding went perfect, I married the most awesome person in the world and we all had a blast at the reception. I did end up confessing to Molly towards the end of the reception because part of me still felt guilty. The only thing she asked was if the ""Blame Emily"" thing was Emily's idea. I told her it was and I had no idea she was going to do it, but I was serious about giving up my plate to make sure she could still come. She actually laughed at me and told me I was an idiot, but I'd picked a good one. Anyways, she forgave me completely, even though I don't really deserve it. I asked her if she was coming to the after-party (yes, we had an after-party for our wedding reception after the ""adults"" and ""younger kids"" went home) at our apartment. She said Emily had already invited her and she wouldn't miss it. (Which she didn't. We all hung out, drinking and playing board games until about 4am. She kicked my ass at both Settlers and King of Tokyo.) **TL;DR-** I married an awesome person. Molly came to the rehearsal dinner. I fessed up. She called me an idiot. We're good now. Molly's coming by for another board-game night this weekend with our mixed group of friends. **Minor Update to the update-**  So... it turns out ""Molly"" reddits, and because of the number of upvotes this got, it hit her front page and she called me yesterday to call me out on it. She was pretty mad. I think her exact word were: ""Dude, did you seriously name me after your mom's cat?"" So going forward, please replace ""Molly"" with ""Princess Mollificent Bananahammock; the first of her name, Queen of Tokyo, Catan and Avalon, Lady of the Six Cousins and Protector of the Realm, the Unbothered, Mother of Pokemon, Breaker of Chains."" Oh, and sorry /u/1Timer1. Apparently she doesn't accept internet proposals on threads where she is named after A BELOVED SNUGGLY FAMILY MEMBER WHO YOU LOVE, BTW! She's still coming to game night though. :)","One of my favorite updates ever. I remembered your post and this is a good testament that everything is fixable if  you go about it in a nice, rational fashion. You definitely got yourself a great partner and a great cousin :D Don't beat yourself up too much either, clearly they love you, the great person who went the extra mile to fix your error too :)",1536
4uupnu,"ORIGINAL: [reddit!]https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4u46o4/me_22f_with_my_boyfriend_26m_of_2_years_hes/ My first post didn't get a whole lot of attention, but I figured I'd update anyway, as it's a happy one. The TL;DR of my last post was that, after recently moving cities and experiencing a lifestyle change (boyfriend started working 80-100 hours/week) I was feeling stressed out and drained from my job, which involves animal research, and thought that getting a pet would really help me (as it has in the past). Since we really don't have time for a dog, I wanted to get a cat, and while he initially agreed to it, my boyfriend sat me down 8 months ago and reiterated that he wasn't super into cats and that since I seemed to be adapting well if I would hold off on getting one. Since then, my mental health has gone down a little and I wanted advice on how to talk to him about it. Firstly, I got a couple of PMs and comments telling me that my boyfriend doesn't have to work that much and that I shouldn't be okay with it. This is a little naive, people. Everyone that has his position works as much as he does and he loves his job, so he needs to put up with the hours for about 5 years until he's moved up the chain of command. So that's not really up for discussion and never has been. He loves his job and feels fulfilled at work, which is something I want for him.  ONTO THE UPDATE...  I got a lot (a looot) of comments that sort of told me off for wanting to make a plea for a pet that my boyfriend wasn't on board with so I initially decided not to broach the topic and keep it to myself.  However, I guess I was closer to my breaking point than I realized because the next night when he got in at midnight, after having a long and stressful day that had put me in a bad headspace for the evening (even after going for a 5k run and lifting some weights) I just sort of had a breakdown in his arms. He was flabbergasted and worried and asked me what was wrong. I sort of... snotted, hiccoughed, and cried as I told him that I felt really lonely and was upset that he'd asked me to hold off on the cat, that I was very sad that I interacted only with animals that hate me and that I can't get attached to all day, and that my colleagues find that their pets ground them; that I couldn't continue coming home to an empty house and that pets were really important to me. He was very shocked to hear all of this, stroked my hair for a while, made me tea, ran me a bath, and said we'd have a serious talk when I got back from my conference (monday & tuesday). I was a little put off by the fact that he wasn't talking about it right away (but understanding because by the time we got to bed it was probably 2am). I was at my conference until last night, but when I got in at around 8PM, I was surprised that our condo door was open--my boyfriend was home (never happens)! I was even more surprised when he came to the door, grinning, with a big Maine Coon cat in his arms that I'm very familiar with--my childhood kitty that lives with my parents.  Well, I was pretty much a mess after that, happy and sobbing all over Snuffles (Snuffles rather frantically twisting his body in 1000 bizarre ways trying to get away and thereby avoid salty tears and snot), and my boyfriend explained: we were ""borrowing"" Snuffles for the next 7 weeks from my parents. He then said with an even bigger grin that he was serving as my cat ""in the interim of waiting for your new Abyssinian kitten to age to 10 weeks, at which point we'll give Snuffles back and bring in the kitten."" My heart was so full. I was surprised that he remembered my brief mention that I thought that an Abyssinian would be a good breed fit for us (not super vocal, very friendly, short hair, indoor cat). I definitely never expected him to pay for the cat or anything, but he has put a deposit down and I will go pick a kitten from the breeder's litter in the next couple of weeks!! I asked him what had made him change his mind the full 180 degrees and he just sort of explained that he was only ever ""sort of"" against the cat and thought I had been doing just fine mentally, so I didn't need one, and just figured we'd get a dog once we'd moved out of the city centre in 5 years or so, once both of us have reduced our hours. He also is still a little bit concerned that a cat isn't going to be a fix-all, so I made an appointment with a psychologist I used to see and will be driving to my hometown next week for a ""check in"" with her.  I thought he didn't want a cat because his dad thinks they're an ""unmanly"" pet, so I asked him as much, and he rolled his eyes and said ""Look, the CEO of Snapchat can't even find a hotter partner than I can and he definitely isn't dating someone that is getting a PhD. There's literally nothing in the world that is a threat to my manliness""  Also, just like I thought (because I know my boyfriend well, not just a ""magical rationalization"" I ""made up just because [I] want a cat""), this morning I woke up to my boyfriend spooning Snuffles instead of me; he'll be fine having a cat.   **tl;dr**: we good, he wasn't actually really against getting a cat, so we're getting a kitten, and in the meantime I get to hang out with my old buddy.","He borrowed your childhood cat back for you on top of getting you a kitten?  Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. So this tells me two things.  One, you have a great man there.  Two, you need to be a lot more clear about talking things through.  See what wonderful things happen when you do?  Hopefully next time it won't take a breakdown - that's not good for you OR him, sweetie. And why aren't there pictures of Snuffles?  Threads concerning kitties demand kitty pictures!",1654
4uxn4r,"Link to original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4um20k/my_29m_very_rich_gf_25f_of_8_months_wants_to_pay/ First of all I want to say thank you to everyone who contributed to my last post. I never expected it to blow up the way it did and get that many replies. After a while the number of responses got overwhelming and I was unable to reply to many of the later posts and/or questions.  I do wanna clarify a few things which kept coming up in the last post. This situation for me has absolutely nothing to do with ""gender expectations"" or anything like that, that's just not who I am. I suppose I should have expected that response from this sub given so many of the posts are about cheating, abusive partners or people confused with gender stereotypes etc.  With that out of the way I also should have clarified in my OP that I am not a big gift receiver in general. I feel uncomfortable even when my parents, friends or other family members splurge on me. I also want to point out that people kept on bringing up scaling of money in that $200 for me has the same value that 5k has for her. Yes, that's fine in theory but it can still be hard to comprehend in real life when I have never had that kind of money splurged on me or lived such a high class lifestyle. It's easier said than done when people were urging me to accept her proposal with grace.  Anyway, here goes the actual update: ---------------------------------------------------------- Before posting my last post I had already decided that I was going to turn her down and I wanted to get advice on how to politely turn her down. After listening to the good people of this sub I opened my mind a little and decided to have a talk with her about our relationship, her money, and our finances moving forward with an open mind.  She came over last night after work and we talked about her proposal. I told her I was incredibly thankful for her offer but in all honestly it did make me uncomfortable. I explained to her that it was because of my middle class background and the fact that I am not a big gift receiver in general. She cut me off right then and there and said she was sorry if she felt me uncomfortable and she was only coming from a good place. She revealed to me that growing up even she had feelings similar to mine because she viewed everything as her ""family's money"" and only after she matured later on in life did she start to not feel bad about her wealth and privilege, and simply starting enjoying it for what it is. She told me she has a standing offer from her father to work a cushy job in the family business but she still does understand the value of money and that's why she still works on her own. We then talked about her family's wealth and the impact it had on her past relationships. She told me that usually she's never offered to do something this big for anyone else but she only offered this because she really trusts me, respects me and has fallen for me hard. She mentioned that in her last relationship she kept everything 50-50 because she wasn't sure about the guy and their relationship got very toxic by the end because he simply expected her to pay for everything. She said she loves my ambition and wants me to  keep progressing in my career.  All that being said, I asked her what it would mean for our relationship going forward if I accepted. We both decided that nothing changes, we keep on splitting it 50-50 as we have so far. She joked that she wouldn't let me off the hook for future dates/expenses this easily lol. For any future trips/activities we decided that we won't always go for the most expensive options or the most budget friendly ones and try to find more of a middle ground.  Ultimately she insisted that because she had already made the offer I had to accept. I did with the compromise being that once we are there we are going to split everything else 50-50, she will let me treat her a few times, and we won't be splurging the way she is used to on vacations.  I am really thankful that his happened and we both feel closer than ever. She will be coming over on Friday to spend the weekend with me and plan/book this trip. I couldn't be happier right now.  **tl;dr: She came over, we talked about the money and the state of our relationship. I accepted her offer and we both feel a lot closer.** ","I do not see this a positive update. I'm sorry, but I don't.  I had a very serious boyfriend that things ended over the fact that I'm more wealthy than him. Sure, keeping day to day expenses makes sense. You don't want to create a lifestyle where one person feels indebted to the other person (which btw if genders were flipped, it'd be less of an issue.)  But to make every and all expenses a 50-50 split, it's limiting the wealthier partner's lifestyle. Someone shouldn't have to limit their vacations or splurges because the other partner isn't as wealthy. I think your 50/50 split is going to cause issues down the road and you aren't looking that far to see it. My current partner is independently wealthy plus he works in finance. So compared to him, I'm the poorer partner. If he wants to kick in some extra money for a house we both love, that's fine. He doesn't have to limit his choices based on my finances.  Creating a class barrier in your relationship is not a good idea and you have to stop looking at living life through her lenses as charity. She can afford it. She wants to share an experience with you. Accept that she wants to share her life with you. Don't expect her to live only your life.",2273
4vqsbl,"[Link to OP.](https://redd.it/4vaiwq) TL;DR: I went to the movies with a girl, she kissed me, I froze, we haven't talked since. --- My original post didn't get much attention, but a lot has happened since I made that last post so I figured I'd update. I took the advice of reaching out to her again and I invited her to the movies again (I go there a lot lol). We met up at the theater and we talked about our previous date. Me: ""So... sorry about not talking to you for a few days."" Her: ""It's cool."" Me: ""Yeah... I was just kind of caught off guard by the kiss. Not that I disliked it, uh, I was just kind of surprised and I wasn't expecting it because I've never been kissed before. I mean, uh, I've been kissed by like my grandma and stuff-"" At this point in my awkward ramble, she starts laughing. ""You are so funny."" We stood there in silence for a second. I decided to break the silence. ""You know, it wasn't a *bad* kiss. I was just kinda caught off guard. I mean, I don't really have the authority to judge kisses, considering I've only had the one-"" And she cut me off and kissed me. Except this time, it was reciprocated. We stopped kissing and she looked at me and said, ""Two."" So yeah, I guess I have a girlfriend now. Edit: for people picturing me as Michael Cera, imagine him crossed with Tobey Maguire from the first 20 minutes of Spider-Man. ---    **TL;DR: I went out with her again and talked about it.

I appreciate all the advice on my last post :) special thanks to /u/anodynic for her long piece of important advice. Anyways so it's been 10 days since my last post and about a month since my daughter has been with her boyfriend. After reading all the advice I decided I needed to support my daughter rather than be judgemental towards who she's in a relationship with. We had a talk the following day and I told her that I loved her and if she wants to date him then I am going to be a supportive father and that I shouldn't have been playing a police officer role. I told her if she needed help or had any questions or anything that I'd be there for her and she can tell me anything. She was really happy and said that she's ecstatic that I'm accepting of who she wants to date and I apologized again for jumping to conclusions earlier. I told her that as with every boyfriend, I'd like to meet him and get to know her new man. This time she didn't use the ""he has work"" excuse and we met the next day for dinner at a restaurant. He didn't give off an amazing vibe but he wasn't a total douche either. I guess he was a decent guy but I felt uncomfortable with how much he would touch and grab her publicly but maybe that's just me being a dad. So anyway fast forward a few more days and this is where it goes downhill. My daughter comes home and tells me he asked her when she wants to move in with him. I was in absolute shock. She told me that she doesn't want to move in with him right now and she said ""Everything's moving too fast and I'm afraid he'll get really angry with me if I say no, but I want to live here dad"". I told her she could just say no and if he wants to be angry then so be it & that she is completely right with being concerned that it's happening quickly. She said that she was afraid he was going to hurt her if she refused to move and I just instantly bawled. It's embarrassing to look back at now because she was making me feel better instead of me being mucho dad but it was the worst thing to ever hear that my daughter was so afraid of this shit guy. I gave her a hug and told her she would be safe with me, and we just needed to figure out what we were gonna do. A few days later she decided she wanted to break up, and have me listen on speaker and talk to him if ""things got bad"". They talked at first and when she broke up with him he went all physco and told her ""you won't break up with me or I'll pinch you again babe.. And this time it'll hurt!"" I looked at her and she looked terrified so I took over and basically yelled at him really loudly (probably louder than I should have) and said ""if you haven't heard she's breaking up with you. And if you ever go near my daughter again I'm going to pinch the hell out of you!"" He just hung up :P My daughter looked at me and said ""I have never seen you so angry!"" I never thought I would be updating this but since it's been a crazy week I'll update everyone. im just happy that she's safe and well see what happens from here. Hopefully he won't continue to bother her but if he does, a restraining order is always possible. Thanks again everyone :) Tldr; they broke up! Edit: HOLY SHIT this blew up!! I'm at work so I can't read or answer much of the replies but I'll get to everyone tonight hopefully! & for all those who are wondering- yes it was pinch not punch. No typo there! Thanks everyone for the support its amazing to hear! :)","Hey man, good work. You just showed in practice how effective it can be when you establish yourself as someone that your children can trust to come to you for help without judgement. A+ parenting. ",3787
4xbd4w,"This is an update post! this is probably the quickest update ever but it's such a happy update that I just want to share with everyone :) Original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4x58pn/my_gf_24_f_of_3_months_never_cuddles_with_me_27_m/d6dk9f4?context=3 So I read a lot of the advice and decided that I was going to talk to her about a possible break up. I know this makes me sound like a shit person but honestly I'm just a very touchy guy and express my affection by touching and being touched. Not being able to cuddle or hold hands or sleep next to my girlfriend was not going to work out for me and just felt like a constant tease you'd get from a long distance relationship where you'd think about holding and cuddling your gal or guy but just don't end up doing it. Honestly it was not gonna work out.  I brought my gf to my house after telling her we had to chat. I started by telling her that I'm really sorry and like her very much but I don't think things will work out with our different cuddling preferences. She started crying and said she didn't want me to be turned off by this but she actually loves cuddling but has a ""sweating disorder"" and when she cuddles she gets super sweaty like I'm talking hella sweaty. She said her ex boyfriend dumped her because of her sweating and she said that's why she didn't want to cuddle with me. She said the same thing happens when she holds hands and she gets super sweaty. She said she was afraid cuddling with me would make me leave her like with her ex in the past. I felt bad that I've been giving her so much shit about it and it was like an insecurity she had and I told her that I don't really care if she sweats on me its all good. She laughed and said ""no I actually sweat buckets"" and I told her ""can you sweat buckets on me?"" :P she thought about it and then she said ""okay but don't break up with me over it if I sweat too much!"" In a joking voice.  She layed beside me and we cuddled and it felt so fucking good to finally feel that with her. She actually managed to sweat so much that my shirt was pretty wet and the bed sheet was soaked and I told her that I found it pretty cool. She said that she is so happy that someone appreciates cuddles and doesn't mind the sweating and I was just so happy we were finally cuddling. I told her I didn't mind getting soaked cuddling and said ""at least now we can have kisses in the rain in bed"" and she couldn't stop laughing. She asked if we could hold hands in bed to show me how sweaty her hands get and again my hands were wet as hell which I didn't mind. She said ""if you ever need to wash your hands and there's no sink available just hold my hands!"" Which was really cute. It's been an amazing day and I'm just really happy things worked out. I told her that if she felt like things her ex said to her were hurting her and still making her feel insecure she should really consider maybe seeing a therapist to help her feel more comfortable. She agreed and said that the fact that I like her sweating lifted a burden off her shoulders since she loves cuddles. Hopefully all goes well! Tldr; she is an excessive sweater that's all :P","You know, I legitimately think this is the oddest story I've ever read on this subreddit. But I like it. Good for you bud ",3124
4xpcfj,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4skueq/my_19f_manager_25m_had_unlocked_my_phone_and_was/ Hello everyone. First of all, big apologies for how long overdue this update is. Since the rules limit me for one update only I wanted to have the most full outcome to give you. Thank you all so, so much for your help and support and advice, I didn't expect so many people to respond to me and I really am grateful. Sadly the outcome isn't so happy. My conclusion from the original post was to go to highest management first and then police if the result wasn't satisfactory, which is what I did.  I went straight to the store manager the morning after my post and was advised to write up and sign a formal grievance, which I did. I then met with two other managers to discuss the details of what happened and any other relevant stuff. They told me they'd talk to the manager in question and any witnesses and get back to me in a week after investigations had taken place. In the meantime, my manager was not allowed to work with me and was told to reschedule all his shifts or work elsewhere.  A week passed and I heard nothing. When I went to find out, apparently due to staff holidays it couldn't be completed in time. I asked how much longer and was told a week. I felt this was too long and was really restless by this point already and so my boyfriend came with me to speak to the police.  We explained the situation and my details were taken down and then we met with a sergeant. To summarise, she told us that in the UK there is no specific law against accessing someone's private phone/recording off someone's private phone without permission. As such, they are unable to search his phone as no arrests can be made. The only thing they could do was go to his house and explain it had been reported and that if he ever distributed it he would be arrested, which they did, and he LIED TO THE POLICE and said he hadn't done anything. Sadly, they said there was nothing more they could do. The internal investigation then concluded and I was told my manager had denied everything, made up a false excuse for the apology text he sent me and basically called me a liar. They told me that there is no CCTV where it happened and nobody who was in the area at the time saw anything (no shit, they were the complete opposite end of the room, as I had already explained). They tried to say they weren't taking sides, but to be honest it seemed like they were. They're moving ME from the department instead of him, because moving him is ""harder"". I really enjoyed my job and now basically I have to suffer because my manager is a disgusting liar. They don't seem to care how serious this is. I ended up almost crying when they legitimately said ""maybe you didn't see anything at all"". I feel like they're accusing me of lying and imagining it, even though one of the managers involved was the one that caught me in the corridor bawling my eyes out. I really wish I could've given a happy update. I'm so upset that I have to move and give up something I enjoy when he gets off without even a slap on the wrist, goes on knowing he can probably do this again to someone else and carry on being the scumbag he is, not to mention, he might still have the videos. He may have distributed them already but how the hell would I know. I have no idea what to do now. The police say nothing else can be done. If anyone has any legal advice around this issue within the UK law then I would be very very grateful for that.  Sorry for the length, and if it's worded badly. Again, thank you all for your advice. I'm sorry this was a bad update. tl;dr: Went to higher management and police about how I caught my manager recording a private video from my phone to his phone. He lied to both; management say not enough evidence to do anything, he gets to keep his job but I have to lose mine. Police say nothing can be done due to no UK law surrounding the subject. ","Wow, that is such shit. Have you thought about going to a lawyer or going to the media? >""maybe you didn't see anything at all"" This makes me fucking sick. Also, even though you're in the UK, /r/legaladvice still may be able to help.",1742
4xv3hs,"I have a mini update to my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xmc3v/i_29f_feel_like_im_wasting_my_life_by_staying/).  I just wanted to say thanks to those of you who commented. I read them all but only got back to the first few who wrote in because yesterday turned into a shit show.   In the morning I said I wanted to go off and do my own thing (it was actually just running errands) for an hour or so alone. He said he had shit to do. Whatever...too early for me to be pissed off, so I dropped it.  I asked again later, suggested he take our child to the park next to us since she's always asking to do stuff with daddy instead of me. Again...said no, he was going to do stuff with his hobby.  So, I broke down. I told him I needed help and that I *needed* a break from just being stuck at home 24/7 being a mom and wife. His response was that he didn't understand why I needed a break, but if I did I could just hang out in my room alone to get away from our child and him. And then asked me to make him lunch.   I think it's too late for the come to Jesus talk. I have no fucks left to give, obviously he never had any. I'm still not sure what my next move is, but I think it involves finding a job and starting a better future without him.   TL;DR: Thanks for the comments on the first post, things are a little clearer now. ",He's happy with this arrangement and he doesn't care that you're unhappy.  Don't give him any more of your fucks. Save them for your new life. ,2614
4yq796,"I had to get a TB test done for some clinic work I'll be doing this year in my grad school program. My sister's friend works as a nurse at the clinic I go to. She wasn't the one who took my blood for the test and as far as I know, the nurses don't actually do the lab work.  Anyway, I got a call from my sister a few days later saying ""Tina"" told her my TB test was positive. Now, due to the nature of my grad school subject I know that sharing medical information is HIGHLY prohibited and she could get fired or worse. I don't really care if my sister knows my test results, but apparently she was talking about this at a party. It just really bothers me that someone from the clinic I go to would share my information like that.  Initially my sister didn't want me to say anything because she doesn't want to cause drama with her friend, but now she's conflicted as well. Apparently someone else they knew came into the clinic recently and requested not to have Tina as her nurse. After that, I guess Tina deliberately searched for this girl's test results and information because she wanted to know what she was hiding. Neither my sister or I really want someone like this working at our clinic, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin her life by getting her fired or possibly blacklisted from working in nursing.  Thoughts? TL;DR My sister's friend shared my medical test results. Should I say anything to the clinic?   Oh and regarding the TB, I had further testing done and it's latent. I'm going to get treated for it but it's not active or contagious. ","You should absolutely say something. That's a massive violation of patient confidentiality. If she loses her job for it, she has only herself to blame. ",6646
4yt4md,"I've had my cat since he was 6 months old. He was an ""unadoptable"" rescue. He had so called unsurviveable pneumonia, and when healthy, was nothing but fear aggression. I was basically cat hospice.  Well, he lived. And he loved. He's the purring-est, snuggliest, sweetest cat. He is now a chubby 16 year old with arthritis (treated with Dasuquin, which has helped immensely, but he's not a kitten anymore). We used to live in a first floor apartment where we could sit outside and I could read and he could be on his tie out and watch birds. Now we don't anymore. Shortly before his 16th birthday, he slipped and/or fell off the bathroom vanity. I didn't see it happen, I only saw the cat who couldn't stand without screaming afterwards. We rushed him to the vet and miraculously nothing was broken, but that left the question of what he DID do. Even in a bad sprain, it may always be weak and he may never walk normally again, or walk at all. If he tore a tendon or ligament, it was basically over. Orthopedic surgeries and senior cats don't usually end well.  For a week and a half, we brought him food and water. We gave him his pain meds. We set him in the litter and held him up. We lifted him onto and off of the bed. It was basically a cat nursing home up in here.  Just when we thought he would never get up again, he did exactly that. Then he walked a few steps. Then it was cat PT. Making him go a little further every day. Getting his strength back up. A month later, aside from sitting over on one hip when he sits, you would never know he had ever been hurt. For his 16th, I loaded him into the car (which he doesn't mind at all) and took him to a park by the lake. He spent a couple hours watching ducks and warming his old bones in the sun.  My boyfriend was indignant. How the cat doesn't even know it's his birthday, what a waste of time, who does that, etc etc.  No, he doesn't know it's his birthday. But he knows he's doing something he enjoys. He knows he feels better than he had been. He knows those things.  Now it's 3 months later and my BF is STILL on about cat birthday outings. Idgi. He helped care for him when,he was injured and did probably more than I did, because I work 10 hour shifts. So I guess staying home to care for an injured cat isn't crazy cat person, but taking the cat to a park is? I mean, there's whole parks devoted to dogs where dogs can see their dog friends. So what's weird about taking a cat out for one afternoon? He's really starting to make me feel like shit about it. tl;dr Senior cat was seriously injured. He recovered, and I took him to the park to celebrate his 16th bday. BF is acting like I murdered his family over it. Am I crazy?","> No, he doesn't know it's his birthday. But he knows he's doing something he enjoys Exactly. It's like giving a pet a food treat. They don't realize the occasion, but it's still pleasant for them. And looking at a park is a better view than being stuck in between 4 walls. Your boyfriend is making a really big deal out of nothing. It was a few hours of your time. No big deal.",2991

She was taking care of me so sweetly, and when we were lying in bed together I felt so happy I just had to tell her. She said for her this is really serious thing and she needs some time, but wasn't weirded out or feeling pressured or anything, and instead was happy. I was perfectly fine with that and mentally accepted that 'OK, if things keep going well I can wait however many more weeks or months it takes her to feel comfortable saying it.'   We spent a romantic weekend mostly just cuddlin' and fuckin' and taking nice walks. Monday morning when she was getting on the bus to work and we were parting ways she said 'Goodbye, I love you' so matter of factly and out of nowhere my heart almost exploded. I was going around with the goofiest smile plastered across my face all day and wanted to sing and dance in the rain. Happiest I've ever been in my life.   TL;DR: She loves me back and the whole world is roses and sunshine! :D Thanks for reassuring me it wasn't freakily-too-soon",Stop it. This is too sweet.,1384
4z9cgn,"Well, title kind of says it all. Throwaway because my husband is active on Reddit. He's probably on it now. Here goes: I've been with my husband for 5 years, married for 1.5. I've never *once* doubted his fidelity. He's great. Super smart, funny, handsome, and, I **thought**, loyal. He's never given me reason to doubt him or be suspicious. I thought it was kind of odd when he downloaded snapchat; he's not big on social media. I have one, but I'm not very active. We rarely snap each other. He said his friends were really active and he liked it better than Facebook, so. As I said, I've never had any reason not to trust him. So I thought nothing of it.  This morning, my husband was in the shower and left his phone on *my* nightstand. I was half-asleep when his phone started chirping and woke me up. We both have the same phone and ringtone for text messages. Not knowing that he had put his phone on my nightstand for whatever reason, I thought it was my phone in my half-asleep state. Despite his black phone case (mine is green), I didn't even notice and I looked at who had texted. It said ""Mom"". Okay, my mom texted me, I can ignore that until I'm actually awake. But under that was a Snapchat notification. A snap from someone named ""Roxy"". I was like who the f is Roxy and why is she snap chatting me? I opened it and bam- it's a picture of a pussy. And not the meowing kind with four legs and a tail. The caption said ""I want your tongue inside me again"". Now. I immediately thought it was a mistake. But I was alert now after being awoken by a vulva. I pretty quickly realized that this was my husband's phone. I felt like I was going to crap the bed and started to sweat. I looked at his contacts on snapchat and she has a yellow heart next to her name. I looked up wtf that means and it means they are ""best friends"". **WTF**. I feel like I'm going to be sick. I didn't do any other snooping because honestly, I know what I'll find. I just don't understand how he could do this. We're happy. I thought we were happy. We have sex *at least* four times a week. Here's the real kicker, Reddit. I'm almost 12 weeks pregnant with our first child. He's sitting in the recliner about 20 feet from me and I just can't find the words to confront him. How do I say what I need to say?? There is **no** way I am somehow overreacting or misreading this situation, is there? I'm heartbroken and don't know what to do. **tl;dr** Accidentally opened my husband's snapchat only to be greeted with a snap of some girl's vagina. I'm nearly 12 weeks pregnant and just can't wrap my head around this. Don't know how to handle this or confront him.  **Update:** First and foremost, thank you all for your love and support. I feel it from here. Honestly, thank you- it's amazing to me that strangers care so much about my baby & me. Love back to all of you. So, husband knows something is up. I don't know if he saw that I opened a snapchat from Roxy and is afraid of what I saw and afraid to bring it up or if he's clueless and can just tell I'm upset about something. He's been asking me if I'm okay or if something is wrong about every hour. I told him my sister was having a hard time today (ironically, she just broke up with her boyfriend. Why? He cheated.) and I was going to go over to her place for dinner (I live in pacific time zone) and to spend the night with her. I'm here now. My sister is 20 and a whiz at the social media thing. She ""stalked"" his Facebook to see if this Roxy person popped up anywhere. She looked through his friend's friends. Bingo, we found her. Well, at least pretty sure. I didn't see her face in the snapchat. The screen was too full of her crotch. She's Facebook friends with my husband's good friend. She is listed as a receptionist at my husband's friend's law firm. My husband works a couple blocks from the law firm and he stops by often to grab lunch with his friend. That would explain how they met. Still formulating a plan on confrontation, trying to get as much information as possible first. My sister wants to burn his life to the ground, and honestly I do too, but I'm going to address this in the most adult way possible so that I can walk away from him with my head held high and be a deserving role model to my baby girl (not sure it's a girl, just a feeling). Good news? My uncle is a lawyer. Most of what he deals with are divorces. I've already contacted him and asked if we could discuss some potential legal issues (didn't specify what yet, feels like something I should do in person during our meeting). I told him it was urgent; we are meeting tomorrow morning. I will try to update as much as I can and from the bottom of my heart, thank you all again, Internet strangers! **UPDATE:** hey everyone, so because this was a throwaway account, I never linked my email. I am unable to post an update because the link to approve it requires me to re-sign in. So, I created another throwaway account to be able to send an update.

4zkbp3,"Link to original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z9cgn/i_26f_opened_my_husbands_32m_snapchat_and_it_was/?ref=search_posts Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you **so much**. So, husband cheated. He has been since ""maybe two weeks before last Christmas"", according to him. I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his ""best friend"" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first.  He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're ""best friends"" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of ""inspirational"" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness. First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her. He answered with, ""Not on purpose"". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one. I asked what ""Not on purpose"" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, ""I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad."" Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you *never* accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human). This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his *wife*, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why. He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate.  Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the **first** night they met. This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information. My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support.  I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby. A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer. There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I *have* to be strong enough. Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get. **tl;dr** Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably *really* hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit! **Edit:** Formatting **UPDATE:** I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that **you** have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing.  Love to you all.  **Me again:** I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post.  I will leave you with this: My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you. Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world. Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to ""be terrifying"" by being strong and not standing for nonsense. This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to ""be terrifying"". :) Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes. Love, -T ","I've been thinking of you since I saw the original post a few days ago. It broke my heart to hear this, you deserve a thousand times better than a man like him. You've handled the entire thing with utter grace by the sounds of things, I for one could not keep my cool especially if I had pregnancy hormones whizzing around my body. I am flawed by your measured response and strength to leave someone who quite clearly doesn't deserve you. That is true strength. Your child is lucky to have such a strong mother and role model. All the best for the future, you deserve happiness x",3352
4zo0cs,"Throwaway account because my boyfriend is an avid redditor.  He's a fashion photographer. Meaning he works alongside many beautiful women in his profession. Stylists, hair and makeup artists, and of course, *models*.  This is actually how we met.  I modeled my way through college and he photographed me, after which we became friends and eventually started dating. We have been together now for almost three years. I've since stopped modeling, but he is still a photographer. Never once in our relationship has he given me any reason to question his fidelity. With the exception of me, he has never dated or even befriended any of the models he has photographed.  That was, until, Rachel came into the picture.  I've met Rachel. She seems like a fun chick, the type of girl who draws a lot of positive attention just by entering a room. She's beautiful but her personality really shines through. She makes you feel like you're her best friend when you're talking to her. A very *cool* person through and through.  That said, I'm not the only one who feels this way. My boyfriend also adores Rachel. The first time he photographed her, he stayed late at the studio and discussed ideas for their next shoot for nearly three hours. He was actually late for a night out with me because of it, but he's always had terrible time management so I didn't think anything of it.  The lateness has now become a steady, recurring factor in their shoots together. They hang out long after the stylists and makeup artists leave the studio.  They also text a lot, and he's always smiling to himself and laughing when he reads the messages she sends him. At first he would show them to me and try to include me in on all the fun (without me asking) but he abruptly stopped doing that around two weeks ago. He tilts his phone away from me now when Rachel messages him.  I'm not the jealous type but if my bf had a history of doing this with the other models, I'd let it slide. The fact that he is *only* like this with Rachel (and me, I suppose) makes me wary of what might have transpired between them.  Rachel herself has stopped talking to me. We used to communicate and have an easy, casual friendship via IG and Snap chat, but she pretty much ignores me now. Guilty conscience? I don't know.  The real kicker is, my boyfriend now has a photo of Rachel as the wallpaper on his phone. He's apparently proud of the concept and the editing, and claims it has nothing to do with Rachel herself, which is totally believable, but ... doesn't sit right with me. I told him that and he told me I was being irrational.  Rachel is single by the way. She and her bf broke up around three weeks ago, so you be the judge.  I really don't want to fall into the jealous gf trope but what else am I to think? I don't want to make crazy demands and accuse my bf of cheating on me, even emotionally but he really does seem to be fond of this girl in a way that really hurts me. He has other female friends and he doesn't act that way with them. He's capable of being friendly with a girl without flirting or acting suspicious, but with Rachel it's different.  He has slowly become very attached to her and I feel like I'm losing him. I have expressed this to him a couple of times but he always tells me I have nothing to worry about and that he and Rachel are just ""kindred"" when it comes to photography. The long nights, constant texting, and phone wallpaper mean nothing. Oh btw, she's practically naked in the photo and it wasn't taken for any sort of publication; just for fun.  Am I being irrational? Unreasonable? How would you feel in this situation? What would you do?  TL;DR - photographer bf has been growing very close to one of his models and acting dismissive of my concerns regarding their work relationship. He has a practically naked photo of her as his phone wallpaper. Wtf am I supposed to think?  **mini update:** He and I are meeting for lunch in an hour. **extra mini update:** He confessed. More on that later.  **micro teacup update:** I'll give you guys the full story as soon as this post is kicked off the front page. Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think we're allowed to post updates until the dust has settled on the original.  In any case, thank you so much for all the advice and overwhelming kindness. I'm kind of a mess right now but I'm lucky enough to have an amazing support system and a clear head. That's all I really wanted out of this unfortunate situation.   **OFFICIAL UPDATE:**   [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zo0cs/my_26f_boyfriend_28m_has_become_suspiciously/) First of all, I’d like to thank everyone who left a comment on the original post. Your advice, your words of encouragement and support, and even your criticism has helped me immensely. Thanks. Really.  Second, I’d like to address a few things:  1. My boyfriend — sorry, ex boyfriend — has never taken nude or even partially nude photos of me. Although I modelled in high school and university, my primary focus has always been stage acting. He took my head shots. That’s how we met. Not that it really changes anything. Just a bit of insight, I guess.  2. When we were younger and when the relationship was newer, I would accompany him to his shoots all the time. But my own career is very time consuming nowadays. I know of multiple model/photographer relationships where they accompany each other to every shoot, and I’ve nothing against doing that, but I personally would rather just trust that my SO is on their best behaviour. Obviously what happened here kind of squashes that … but I stand by it. If I have to be there in order to make sure my SO faithful, chances are they’ll find other ways to cheat. 3. I’m flattered by the offers, but no, I will not be meeting anyone for drinks anywhere. Sorry for the bluntness, just … yeah. Okay, now for the good stuff! … or I guess, the bad stuff.  I met him for lunch Friday afternoon. We went to our favourite sushi joint overlooking the ocean, and I ordered more than I could handle, stuffing my face while trying to decide how to broach the topic of Rachel, but most importantly, our relationship. I went into that meeting with a righteous, ass-kicking speech prepared, but I forgot every word of it almost immediately after we sat down. I guess he could tell there was something on my mind, because he asked me if I was alright, if he had done anything to upset me. *Snorts.* Yes, Ian, you’ve upset me very much, actually. As soon as I gathered the confidence to look him in the eyes, I point blank asked him, “What’s going on between you and Rachel?” His mouth flew open as if he were completely and utterly taken aback by the implication, but I cut him off with, “DO NOT bullshit me.”  I tried my best not to let anger get the best of me, I really did. I wanted to stay cool, calm, and collected like so many women on this sub. You know the ones. Those intense stories of cheating husbands wherein the wife takes to /r/relationships, garners a ton of support, and then updates us later with a well-constructed, storybook post detailing the evidence she has collected against him and the meeting she had with her Uncle or sibling, who just so happens to be a divorce lawyer … ?  Yeah, I’m not a badass like that. I wish I were, but I’m honestly just an overly emotional doormat and I knew going into this meeting that I was either going to cry or gouge his eyes out with my mind. Because I had somewhere to be later, I took a hard left and got super, SUPER angry. He could see it in me, the anger bubbling over. The people in the restaurant were starting to stare at us, too. In order to save face I threw money on the table (with tip) and told him to meet me in the parking lot. If I’d had a switchblade on me, I can’t say for certain I wouldn’t have channeled my inner Jet and beat his Shark ass to the pavement. Kidding. Totally kidding.   We met inside my car. He climbed in after me, his head down as though he were ashamed or … I don’t know, GUILTY?!?!?!?!?! I asked him *how*, and he explained everything to me. No preamble whatsoever.  The moment he met Rachel he felt some type of way towards her. He couldn’t tell whether it was just a silly crush or something more, but he knew she felt it, too. *How cuuuuuuute*.  **BARF.** They kissed the first night they met. The night he nearly stood me up.  They had CRAZY, **emotional**, *~forbidden* sex the night she and her boyfriend called it quits. And they’ve been fucking ever since.  He mentioned he has always used a condom with her, but I don’t care. I’m getting tested. Oh and because so many people asked in the original post, I figure I should mention Rachel was the one who was broken up with in her previous relationship. I don’t know why or how. I didn’t ask and I don’t care to know. Funnily enough, Ian said he doesn’t want to be with Rachel, he wants to be with me, and he even provided text messages to show that he’s the one who decided not to pursue anything with her on official grounds, but I told him I give zero fucks about what he wants. And unless he can go w/o his eyes, he should get the fuck out of my car and erase me from his mind before I erase him.  I literally said that.   In any case, I went home later that day, posted an update for you guys on the original, and drank. A lot.  My friends and family, and most of Ian’s friends and family, have rallied around me in support. I guess he told his mother we broke up and how it happened, because she called me this morning and said she’s disgusted with her son and that if I need anything at all, she’s always there for me.  For real, you guys, I’m going to miss his family. They’re good people. The best people.  This is my first “adult” breakup, by the way. The type of breakup where you’re required not only to break up with your SO but with their family and friends, as well. These people you’ve spent so much time getting to know and growing to love, are suddenly not in your life anymore and it’s … well, it’s kind of daunting, really. Daunting and sad and infuriating all at the same time. So, that’s the conclusion to this story. That’s what happened.  Thank you again to everyone.  If I have anything to add, I’ll do so below. TL;DR - he admitted to cheating with Rachel and then I dumped his ass. **note:** To the person who said violence is never the answer and I should never have threatened my ex - *You're right, you are absolutely right, but if you're ever in a situation where your lying, cheating ex refuses to leave your car the first dozen times you asked, I dare you not to lose your shit and say things you don't mean just so he gets the fuck out (and doesn't see you cry).*  **microscopic update:** So far, his mother, his teenaged step-brother, and two male friends of his, have reached out to me saying how disgusted, ashamed and embarrassed they are on his behalf. On top of three mutual friends. It hasn't been two days yet, you guys.  ","Yeah, I've watched exactly this play out with a friend who is married to a fashion photographer. Sorry, who *was* married to a fashion photographer, before he ""upgraded"" her to his ""Rachel""",1993

It made me feel so much better! This is a really happy update! I ate lunch outside today and I was sitting alone when four girls approached me. They had that they had all moved from different states and countries, and asked if they could sit with me. I was prepared to eat alone or approach some people like you guys said- so this was a relief!  Of course I said yes! And we really hit it off. We walked around the school after we were done and chatted. We made a group chat and agreed to sit together again tomorrow! They're all really nice and I think we're going to be good friends. I'm really glad I made some new friends- I'm not that scared of high school anymore! The only bad thing that happened is I lost my textbook! I looked everywhere for it but it's gone. I don't even know where I left it... I feel awful and hope my teacher isn't mad. :( But all in all it was a great day- thank you for all the nice wishes!!! TLDR: lunch went great- four girls sat down with me and we are friends now. Sitting with them again tomorrow. I did however, lose a textbook the same day it was given to me and feel awful...  Edit: thanks for all the nice comments! I was told not to worry about the textbook and got a new one :)","I didn't see anyone sitting alone yesterday- but if I do we will go up to them!

As the story goes one day after school his sister walked into a police station and told them what was happening. The police went to her house and they found my nephew dehydrated and dry heaving into a toilet. Fast forward my niece and nephew moved from California to Ohio to live with our cousin [26F]. My family is calling my niece a traitor because my brother is now depressed he can't see his kids again My Nephew even told me he could not thank his sister enough Do you have any advice on what to do, because I don't know anymore. tl;dr: Family is calling niece a traitor ","Your niece is great.

Hello reddit, I debated for a while on whether or not I should post an update. On one hand, I don't want to violate my daughter's privacy and trust, but on the other hand, I received countless comments and messages from people telling me how they related to my Mia's situation and wanted nearly as badly as I did for her to find happiness. In the end I decided that while I am not going to tell Mia about this post, I think she would be okay with me sharing vague details in order to benefit other people like her. Soon after I made my post, I visited Mia and she told me about something she and her therapist had been discussing. Mia said that if she was going to be alone, even if it was just for a little bit longer, she at least wanted be happy with herself. (I think she worded it as saying that was the person she was hanging out with the most, so she needed to like them). So instead of pursuing friends for the time being, she was going to make herself happy. We made a couple appointments for superficial things, she got her teeth whitened and her hair dyed. She also bought some new camera gadgets so she could start practicing photography. Then came the really big decision. She told me she wanted to start taking classes at a different college (film school). I don't know why it never occurred to me but it seems like a natural choice given her love for film. We were only a few months away from when this school's semester started, but because they were small and somewhat under the radar they were very accommodating towards us and I managed to enroll Mia in 3 classes for the fall semester. I was very stressed during this time, but it ended up being worth it. Anyway, Mia started school and is absolutely loving it. The best part, and the reason I am making this post, is because she instantly attracted a bunch of new friends! Mia is very shy so I can tell she's a little overwhelmed by all of this attention all of the sudden, but she is obviously very happy. Instead of teary skype calls she now gushes to me about how her day is going. You guys were all right. She just needed to find a common interest to meet new people and make friends, and that interest turned out to be movies.  I hope this helps those of you who messaged me, and I also hope you now know that even if you think you will be alone forever, don't give up! Maybe you just haven't met the right people yet.  Thanks again reddit.   ---      **tl;dr**: Mia has friends now!","Mia has a new haircut and friends at her new film school, that nice boy successfully asked out the cute deaf girl in sign language, this is just a really great night for me.",1041

Thank you for the gold.   Edit 2: I guess I should clarify that Nita and I are not out of friends completely, and that the comments our other 'friends' were making all the time wasn't friendly advice to prepare ourselfves in case something went wrong. Some of them heard 'pre-eclampsia' and decided either my gf or my baby would die, or I'd certainly lose them both. I freaked out, even with our doctor's words ringing through my mind that Nita was fine. It was brutal to consider the possibility I could lose my girls, especially when there was no need to consider that. Then, when things were over, the same people who were so sure of death were suddenly sure that my gf and baby would pull through no matter what. That hurt and pissed me off, not to mention how much it hurt Nita who didn't need to go through any more stress.  --- I guess the reason I was freaking out so much in my last post was because I knew something was going to happen. Nah, I'm kidding, I was just freaking out. But 4 days after that post, Nita's water broke. She didn't even need to be induced, our baby just decided she wanted out already. We were tense and scared but everything went well and now we're the parents of a healthy baby girl. Nita's health is also good and her mood has improved drastically because she can finally let go of that bed rest rule. Our baby is sweet and tiny and loud and holding her for the first time was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced. We've been adjusting to parenthood ever since and it's been great. Baby cries a lot and I know the crying will eventually drive us a little crazy, but for now I'm just happy my baby has lungs strong enough to wake up the entire neighbourhood. A few of our ''friends'' have called, wanting to check up on Nita and the baby. One of them told me they just knew everything would be alright, and I couldn't help myself then and said that his previous words to me on Nita's pregnancy had been: 'shit, man, you gotta be strong 'cause this is probably gonna end badly'. I told him to fuck off and leave me and my girls alone. So, this is it, I guess. I wanted to update because you guys were really good to us, and calmed us down. I'm sorry I couldn't reply to everyone back then, but I appreciate all the advice and responses. You guys shared yours stories with us, and it meant a lot, be sure of that. tl;dr: Turns out I was freaking out for no reason. My girls are strong as hell and are doing more than fine. Thanks for the help, everyone.", > I told him to fuck off and leave me and my girls alone. Dad mode activated. ,850
51fpp3,"Kyle and I have been best friends since junior high. I'm not going to go into massive detail about our friendship, but he's really important to me and we've been through a lot together. Anyway, fast forward a decade or so and Kyle and I both get engaged around the same time to two wonderful women. It's been really fun planning a wedding with another couple and my fiance, Kacie, and I love having them around. Now, Kacie is a bit of a control freak. She has mostly had final say on everything in the wedding, not that I'm complaining. She has better taste than me and the wedding is going to be really beautiful thanks to her. The one thing she has let me have complete control over is the first dance. I was ecstatic. I really wanted to show her how much she means to me with this dance. I picked out Peter Gabriel's ""The Book of Love"" and edited a video of pictures of her and I growing up, meeting, and falling in love. And then I commissioned an artsy friend of mine to make a literal Book of Love with all our pictures in them. I've cried every time watching it. The whole thing is going to be a huge surprise for her. The only other person who knew about this was Kyle. He kept saying how cool it was I was doing this and how he wished he'd thought of something like it. Kyle's wedding was this weekend. And holy shit, their first dance was to Book of Love and he edited a video of their baby pictures and their relationship. My heart fucking sank like a brick. He wouldn't talk to me during the reception and hasn't responded back to any of my texts. What the hell do I do? I can't go through with my plan. Our social circles intertwine and I'll look like I stole his idea. Should I just tell Kacie and have her help me with a new idea? Do I tell Kyle he's not welcome at my wedding? Or am I just being silly and just go ahead with my plan despite how I feel? tl;dr--Best man stole my wedding idea a few days before my wedding.","Yes, tell Kacie, show her the book you made to prove it was your idea. Now work with her on how to handle the wedding. You can be romantic, but practical. Maybe she can help think of a new song. Lazy Kyle didn’t do a book, and everyone does a photo montage anyway.

51gpbb,"Been with Stephanie (name changed for privacy) for a little over 3 years. More or less relationship is good, she tends to be way overdramatic when we fight (which isn't often) but I can usually talk her down and things work out.  When Stephanie and I first started dating she mentioned a few times in kind of a mysterious (I thought it was attention-seeking, still do) way that she had some kind of mental illness or mental health struggle. Eventually (probably two or three months in) she came out and told me in a really serious conversation that she has body dysmorphia and thinks she's obese and hates herself for it.  Now let me be clear, I love her the way she is, wouldn't change a thing, I don't mind her weight whatsoever. But even when she said it initially, I almost thought it was a joke. Stephanie is obese. I'm not good at guessing weight and she's never told me her weight, but I know she's 5'4 and a size 22 in pants (US). She's by all standards obese. I don't mind it at all. I'm attracted to her, I think she's beautiful, I would never ask her to change a thing. It didn't come up again for a while but last fall she took a psychology course for her college degree and they talked about mental illness and it came back up. She came in one night almost happy? in a weird way, saying that she understands everything that's wrong with her because they talked about BD in class and it all makes sense. She has never been diagnosed by a medical professional and can't see a doctor for lack of health insurance.  Ever since then, she talks about it a lot. I'm not one to poke at people just to poke, so I just let it be. But she talks about it all the time. She blames arguments we have on her BD. She uses it as an excuse to eat poorly and not take care of herself, because she is straight up convinced that she is smaller than she is and that the person she sees in the mirror is a dysmorphic situation. She is part of an online BD support group and talks openly to me about how she's met people who finally understand her, and she gives them advice and guidance based on her ""struggle"" with BD. She's pointed to actresses like Mindy Kalling and compared the actress's body to her ""actual"" body (vs. BD body) and says it's nice to see herself represented on screen. No offense intended to my girlfriend, but that's not her body type. She is much bigger than that. I'm getting to the point where I don't know what to do. She uses it as an excuse for all her behavior. I honestly don't know if she truly thinks she has BD or if she just uses it to justify herself. When we first moved in together, she would cover all the sizes on the tags of her clothes with Sharpie so I wouldn't see them. She's since stopped doing that (or only does it when she remembers), but it made me think she might be aware of her size and just tries to pretend she has BD so no one can talk to her about it. I know this is a weird situation. I'd like to get her or us into counseling but she doesn't have insurance and goes to a community college that doesn't offer student mental health services. I'm not sure what to do.  TL;DR Girlfriend uses body dysmorphia as an excuse for everything, but she's not dysmorphic, she's just overweight. ",You could send her to MyBodyGallery.com.  It's a website where you can put in your height and weight (or pants size) and see other people who are the same size as you.  It's really good for getting a reality check on what size body you actually have.  There's a good chance she's already heard of it though and possibly ignored whatever it showed her. ,3826
51wyaj,"My nephew is really overweight, like extremely big. I promise I don't mean to sound like a witch but he can't make it up the stairs without being short of breathe.  Recently 3 of my sons inhalers went missing, my son asthma is bad. He has really bad asthma attacks from time to time. My husband, children and I hosted a party the night before. So we thought maybe someone threw them out by mistake while drunk. We searched for them but to no luck.  Anyway my daughter [17F] heard from one of her cousins that Stewart has asthma. I called my sister and I asked if this was true and she said it is the first time she is hearing of it. She went into his room and she found my sons inhalers. Her son still lives at home and is not doing anything with his life. No college, no job, nothing.  You can tell they are my sons Asters because we have stickers on them. His little sister who is 7 put smiley faces on them because she believes it helps. My sister confronted him about it and he cam clean. He stole the inhaler and pretended to have asthma so people would not think he is out of shape.  I know he has no job, but those things are not cheap and honestly I am furious. I think he should pay for what he used because really 2 of them are broken. My sister does not think she should pay for them if he can't and is asking me to cut him a break.  I don't think I should, but I don't know what to do. This is really tearing a rift between myself and my sister. But at the same time it's like he stole my little boys inhalers, that to my is unforgivable.  tl;dr: Nephew stole sons inhalers ","He should pay and he's no longer allowed in your house. Your sister is right, she shouldn't pay, HE should because he's an adult. Gotta wonder if you have to press charges for this, but it's going to be hard to prove i guess.

We gave his mother a spare key card to our room just in case, but we did not expect her to use it. I guess we were running late for dinner. She came up to see what was taking so long, tried to open the door, unlocked it on her own (even though we put the do not disturb thing up) and caught us. She stared for a second and then ran out embarrassed. My husband and I burst out laughing. He closed the door, we finished ~~because we're monsters~~ and went down to dinner expecting some awkward laughter and a joke or two.  MIL usually makes the innocent sex joke here and there so we didn't expect her to be traumatized or anything. But she has really made a point to direct weird, shameful remarks at me.

They are a close family so we all live in the same city and they normally hang out every Saturday. I am pregnant with our first child. We both have our dream jobs and everything is fine apart from his father  I get aggressively hit on by men when I go out, it's part of the reason why when I am in a relationship I rarely go out to bars or anything like that.

Over night I got a message on Facebook from him and it was a picture of him holding his dick, one flaccid and one erect. With the words after it ""You Like red?""

52hka7,"Link to my update post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52r6o3/update_i_28f_literally_just_found_email_after/ My fiancé, ""Dale"", and I have been together for 5 years. We are as solid as I guess anyone thinks they are before something like this blindsides them. I am in total and complete shock, I'm just sitting here shaking I can't even cry yet. Dale is at work right now, I haven't texted him or called him or anything at this point. When we got together he had just broken up with his college sweetheart. She was his first love. I was afraid I was rebound, he said that wasn't true I believed him, rest is history. Sorry is this is rushed and all over the place, nothing makes sense in my head right now. I used his laptop about 2 hours ago to open his contacts list he has saved on there so I could get addresses for our wedding invites. Been telling him to get those to me for over a week so I decided to do it. He keeps his contacts info on his email. When I opened his email, I saw an email on the very top of his inbox with the the subject line ""Re: Jen (not real name), how can I when..."" The subject line got cut off after that so I couldn't see more without clicking. ""Jen"" is the name of his ex from college. I sat there for at least 10 minutes trying to decide if I should open it or not. I decided he should have nothing to hide so I did it. Rest of the subject line was ""Re: Jen, how can I when you still exist?"" The email was her replying to a string of emails between the two of them that has gone on for over a week. Long story short, Dale is still in love with Jen. He thinks about her constantly, he'll never find another woman like her. Even worse is that he makes fun of me and she laughs about it. One email she asks him why I don't make him happy and isn't he satisfied with me? I can't remember word for word, and I don't feel like reading it again, but he said something like ""she tries. She's just not good though, way too vanilla. I love her but the only way I can get off is when I think about f**king you and how wet you'd get. I think every inch of my bed was soaked from your pussy I have the biggest hard on just thinking about it."" And then she answered with a bunch of ""lol""s and said she felt sorry for the ""poor girl"". Another thing he said was that he made fun of me for having a large scar across my chest, onto my left breast, which has disfigured the nipple a bit. He said it looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands.  That is almost too much to bear, he might as well have punched me in the gut. I was in an awful car accident when I was a teenager. I had a big piece of dashboard shatter and basically fly into my chest. I almost died. I've never been ashamed of the scar. It's like a constant reminder that I survived something a lot of people don't and I should be grateful to be alive. The slight disfigurement of the nipple doesn't bother me either, I've always had the attitude of ""if someone doesn't want me because of a nipple, f**k them."" But to hear him make fun of something he knows is a result of something so major in my life (my friend was thrown from the backseat and lost her life) is just... I have no words. The emails go on. Some are explicit, one she describe how she just masturbated while thinking about how he used to go down on her for hours. I'm assuming that these emails are just a small portion of their contact. The first email in the thread was Dale talking about how he doesn't think he can marry me and that he thinks about leaving me almost constantly. He said if she lived in this state he'd already have left me. It didn't sound like the first time they'd reconnected so I'm guessing if I snooped I'd find texts too. I don't need to snoop further. I've seen all I need to. Obviously I'm not going to stay. Despite what he said about me, I'm pretty great and I know this. He said he misses ""backdoor"". Apparently I'm too vanilla to give it to him. Thing is, I've tried to initiate that as I enjoy it and he told me he wasn't into that. So he lied. Just to cast me in bad light. I'm so f**king mad I just want to throw his shit into a pile and light it on fire. But I won't. Because I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing how much he hurt me. I'm not sure why I posted here. It's too fresh to talk to my friends and family. Should I just pack my stuff and leave with no explanation? Just ghost? I've got too much dignity to scream and cry in front of him. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I want comfort or advice or what, I just needed someone to know what happened so I don't feel so alone right now. **tl;dr** fiancé made fun of me and sent explicit emails to his ex. Just found them. Heartbroken, angry, hurt, every emotion ever going on. Don't know if I should just ghost him and never see him again or confront him? I need nice words from Internet strangers or something right now.","Thank god you found this now. What a massive bullet dodged. Print out the emails and forward a copy to yourself just in case he tries to slander you to mutual friends or play the victim. Pack all your shit up. Tape a copy of the emails to his front door and leave. Leave a note, ""Consider our relationship over. Do not contact me again."" Go to a friends house, cry. Drink wine. Don't answer his calls. You can worry about the rest later. There's no point in confronting him. What he said and did was unforgivable. Don't give him the satisfaction of an argument. You'll get through this. Blessing in disguise. What a snake in the grass. Pathetic coward. Do not be there when he gets home or tell him to make different arrangements depending on the housing situation.",8050
52kufz,"My husband and I have been together five years and we have two children 3M and 2F. Last week I was taking my daughter to the doctor and I was going to bring my son along. My husband told me not to worry about it and he would look after him. Once we were done at the doctor I went to go visit my sister for a little bit with my daughter.  Both our children are perfectly healthy, my daughter just had this cough that kept getting worse so I took her to the doctor. She's getting better now. But last night I got a E-Mail from a woman yesterday evening. I had just put the kids to bed and I was working.  The title read ""Concern over your son"" It caught my eye, because I was thinking who is this and why is she talking about my kid. This woman Ember [fake name] claimed to know my husband. Not only that she claimed to be sleeping with my husband and that they were in love.  She messaged me to tell me that she was over at my house last week. The day I took my daughter to the doctor, she even mentioned this in the Email. She told me my son was wondering around while my husband and I quote ""fucked my brains out in your bed"" She told me to take my son with me when I go out so they can have some privacy. The things I wanted to do to her when I read it, hell would reserve a special section just for me.  I was furious and I asked my husband who was watching TV who is Ember. The look on his face said it all, you could just tell his heart sank and he was shitting himself. He was stuttering, and was telling me she's nobody. A long argument later he told me to ""go fuck myself and left"" He called me and left a voice mail on our home phone told me he was leaving me and he hated being a father. He told me to keep the kids and keep his shit. He sent this again as a text for some reason. I don't know what to do next, I am still in shock, I'm angry, I need some guidance. I did so much for him I earned more money than him, I payed for almost anything that loser did. I work in marketing for a major company and he is unemployed mechanic tl;dr: Husband cheated on me when son was home and has left me . I need guidance of what to do next ","Save the texts and the emails from ""Ember."" Change all your passwords just in case he tries to get in and delete everything. See a lawyer immediately. I'm so sorry this happened to you. ",3843
52r6o3,"Link to original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52hka7/i_28f_literally_just_found_email_after_email_from/ Hey everyone. First off, thank you for caring so much about my situation. You all have great advice, encouragement, and you helped me hold on to the strength I need to make it through this. I still have a lot to get through and I'm hurting so much right now. It comes in waves; sometimes I feel so empowered and strong, then 10 minutes later I'm crying in a ball and feel like I can't move or do anything. Last night I texted Dale and told him that my best friend, ""Jake"", had gotten into a fight with his boyfriend and I was going to go stay with him so he could vent and have somebody with him. I told Jake what happened and showed him the emails (I took pictures of them on my phone in case I needed them for whatever reason). Jake and his boyfriend ""Mike"" (who he had obviously not gotten into a fight with and was there) were infuriated and we all just sort of cried together for a while. They stayed up with me almost all night helping me figure out my next moves. We all agreed that taking the high road was the best route. We made a list of all the things that were necessary to get out of the apartment. Mike is a property manager for a different apartment complex so this morning he called my property manager and gave her a very condensed, detail-free version of what was happening. I have always thought it important to get to know your property manager in case you ever have a situation where they can help you out, so she always really liked me. Dale and I have been paying rent on a month to month basis for about 3 months because we were starting to look for houses to purchase after we settled down after the wedding. My property manager told Mike that working out getting my name off of the rental agreement wouldn't be a problem and to not worry about the 30 day notice that she typically requires for a tenant moving out. As far as finances go, I make about 70% of our combined income and Dale only covers about 30%. When Jake, Mike, and I were discussing the logistics of me moving out, Mike brought up the point that Dale does not make enough to cover the required 3x rent in income each month. Meaning he will most likely be given notice to move out if he cannot find a roommate fast. We lived in a one bedroom so I doubt he'll be able to find someone quickly who is willing to sleep on a couch versus having their own bedroom. Especially since I purchased the couch, so... there isn't even one there anymore. The thought of this brings me great pleasure, as I'm sure you can imagine. Jake and I each called out of work today and we rented one of those mover pick up trucks. We were pretty organized after making our list and it only took us a couple of trips to get my stuff out and into Jake and Mike's garage for the time being. Dale texted me a couple of times asking how Jake is and if I'm coming home after work tonight. I told him I'm already home (not exactly a lie, I was there at the time) and then I said Jake was going to be okay and that I just couldn't believe how awful people can be to the people they love. Dale agreed and said that he was glad he had such a ""good girl"" like me. It was tempting to say something about how yeah, I'm just so vanilla that way. I didn't, I just told him to always remember that, how great I am to him. He said of course he would. That felt pretty satisfying and I hope he does remember that everyday for the rest of his life. Whoever it was that posted about the vanilla ice cream idea, Jake, Mike, and I laughed about that hysterically last night. It was the first thing that made me laugh like that and may be the only thing for a while, so thank you for that. I didn't end up ruining any of Dale's stuff, I didn't print out the emails and send them to his family/friends, I didn't do anything destructive or spiteful. However, after all my stuff was out, Jake and I made a trip to the grocery store. I took that poster's advice and I bought one of those big plastic tubs of vanilla ice cream. I left it on the counter with a note and my engagement ring. I wrote ""I know vanilla isn't your favorite flavor, but this is the only vanilla you'll be eating from now on. XOXO"". I mean... I am human. I had to leave him with a little bit of a bang. So here I am. Staying with Mike and Jake for a while. Finding an apartment will be no issue for me, I am comfortable financially on my own with a stable job. I have to deal with the deposits I put down for the venues for both the wedding and the reception. I can't right now, I'm too much of a mess emotionally. I will by the week's end though as I know I can't put it off any longer if there's any hope at all of getting refunded. I had already booked our honeymoon but I did pay the extra for insurance if the trip needed to be cancelled. I honestly don't really know what exactly the insurance covers, I'll have to look into it. Wether or not I can get a refund for Dale's ticket, I will be going on my first trip out of the country on my own and I am happy about this. It's one bright thing to look forward to through this whole mess. I will sell my wedding dress- which was a low cut dress by the way and showed my scar off as much as a wedding dress can. I guess Dale would have found that gross. Or maybe I'll burn it. Burning it sounds kind of fun because I've been holding back so much on not being destructive in a time where I would have found great (albeit temporary) pleasure in burning everything Dale has ever owned. Burning my dress is something I can do privately that will still be satisfying. I can scream and cry and throw rocks at it, pour lighter fluid all over it, watch it burn, and then cook a s'more over it. Because I love s'mores so why not? I am walking away from Dale with my head held high. The best revenge is to walk away as dignified as possible and to not sink to his level. I was close with his family but I'm not going to worry about what he tells them. I am positive it won't be the truth- there is no way he's got the balls and decency to tell them what he did. But *I* know what he did, *he* knows what he did, and all the people who truly love me and who I am close with will know what he did. That's all that really matters. Though it's nice to have those emails just in case Dale tries to take things too far or something. I'm going to be okay. I'm having one of my empowered moments. Though I just spent the last hour in the bathtub sobbing. Like I said, waves. Jake told me that Dale isn't worthy of my ""quirky"" nipple and I agree. When I got in my accident, I was lucky that the shrapnel didn't pierce my heart. I did however suffer from a pretty significant heart contusion (basically a bruised heart) among other injuries. It was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. So yeah, this situation makes my heart hurt, but my heart has been through much worse and kept on ticking along.  Sorry if I rambled a lot, posting this to you all is like a form of therapy and the more thoughts that pop up in my mind, I just write them down for you all to read. I haven't told my family and other friends yet, I'll be tackling that soon. I'm glad the invites hadn't already been sent, at least I don't have to send out a cancellation notice. I deleted Dale off all social media and blocked his email address. I didn't block him off my phone yet because, honestly, I'm curious to his reaction. I can promise you all that I will not respond AT ALL. Not to a single text or call. But I can't help but be interested to see how he reacts. I will block him tomorrow though. Mike told me that the second his messages turn ugly or hateful because I'm not responding, block him. He doesn't want Dale to hurt me anymore than he already has. He's right and I really do plan to block him regardless by tomorrow after seeing his initial reaction. I guess that's all I have to update. Thank you all for caring about me. I will continue moving forward and I will never stop wearing clothes that show my scar. I've never hidden it before and I'm not going to let some asshole make me feel like I should. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all for your love. You gave amazing comments and messages. I will never forget the nice things you all have said to me. Seriously, thank you! PS: I think I will dress up as Edward Scissorhands for Halloween. **tl;dr** got my stuff out of the apartment, left fiancé with basically no explanation. Besides a tub of vanilla ice cream and a little note. I'm feeling okay at this moment but it's been up and down all day and will continue to for a long time. **Edit:** So last night got pretty crazy. It started with Dale playing dumb and asking what was going on and what did he do? Like I promised all of you, I didn't respond. The dick knew exactly what he'd done. He just kept texting and kept texting. One text that I found particularly infuriating was ""I can't think of anything I have done to deserve this. Whatever you think I've done isn't true I'm sure you just misunderstood and I can explain. I mean damn you didn't have to be so dramatic and just leave me like this"". I love how he was already saying that I just misunderstood what I ""think"" he's done and that he can explain. He's such a shit person that he wouldn't  even just come out and admit to the emails and say he's sorry. And then to call me dramatic. The texts progressed into angry ones. Here is a string of texts from him, word for word (except that I corrected some grammar because his grammar is ridiculous). Each text was probably sent about 2 minutes apart, sometimes less. Just so you understand the level of crazy here. I will refer to myself as ""Elle"" in these because he uses my name a lot and my real name starts with an ""L"" so seems appropriate. I blocked him after this, by the way. ""Baby you know how much I love you, I'm at a loss right now. I don't understand, why won't you answer me??"" ""I just tried calling. ELLE PLEASE PICK UP!"" ""We are getting married, I thought you cared about me. I guess I was wrong."" ""I guess you are cold hearted."" ""Elle??????"" ""Baby??"" ""Are you ok? At least answer me so I know you are ok and not hurt or something."" ""Seriously?????"" ""ELLE!!!!"" ""Seriously you're a bitch."" ""I didn't mean that, I'm just getting really worried and upset."" He took about a 20 minute break between that one and this monstrosity: ""You know what, I did mean that. You're a f**king bitch for doing this. If you were unhappy you should have told me. I can't believe you would do this to me, I love you. You are just like your father but even worse because at least your mom is a c--t and so are you so who can blame him. Don't ever contact me again or come crawling back and good luck finding a guy who will love a f**king circus freak bitch. Lol lol lol, dumbass"". So that's when I blocked him. I know nothing he said was true but still... this wasn't just an email to his ex, this was something he sent to me *directly*. I cried a lot after that one, it hit me pretty hard. This is someone I was planning a future with just a couple of days ago. He was so sweet, as far as I knew obviously. He used to kiss my hand almost every morning. It's just such a shock it's hard to wrap my mind around it. Last night was a really tough night to get through for me. I keep reading back what I wrote in this update last night and it helps to keep me feeling strong. I keep reading all of your lovely comments and messages from the original post and it helps to keep me feeling loved and strong. Jake and Mike are wonderful and I'm lucky to have them to hold my hand and help me through this.  Though his texts hurt me, they also reaffirmed that he's a spineless weasel and that I 10000% did the right think by leaving. He's making it really easy to get over him. Sorry this got so long, I wanted to really include you all in what's happening. Thanks for checking in on me and caring about what happens to me, love to you all! **Little update:** Wow! You are all amazing, wonderful people. So much love and support, I'm crying because of all your lovely, sweet messages. It's honestly so encouraging! I had the intention of responding to some comments but the post is now locked, so I just wanted to make sure to update this to say thank you! I hope you all see this. I had a lot of people pm me asking if there were any signs that Dale was an asshole so they know what kind of red flags to look out for. Honestly... no. I wish I could say yes to that so I could potentially prevent others from going through what I did or something similar. He was very attentive and loving, he never once made fun of my appearance (to my face), he seemed to appreciate my ambition and independence. I never felt controlled or criticized for being a financially stable, educated woman. I had a therapist after I lost my friend in the accident. My father had also walked out earlier that year so we were discussing this and how I hadn't seen it coming. My therapist told me that people can make you see whatever they want you to see but that they can't keep up the facade forever. Things almost always come to a head eventually. The only thing you can do is be secure enough with yourself to understand that the faults of others has nothing to do with you. Just make sure you surround yourself with enough good people that you can afford to lose one or two along the way.  I suppose that would be my advice on the matter. Love people openly and let yourself be loved but always keep hold of yourself and make sure you have yourself covered should someone let you down along the way. As far as the dress goes, I believe I will take the advice of many of you and donate it to flood victims in Louisiana. It is a beautiful gown. I think what I will burn instead is my reception dress. I've got to burn something. ;) Thanks Reddit, I sincerely love all of you and wish you the best in all of your life endeavors! I might pop back up in a few weeks to update you all on how I'm doing. <3 Elle","> I cried a lot after that one, it hit me pretty hard. Those disgusting words were carefully picked to do as much damage as he possibly could. He literally sat there and figured out what is the most painful thing he could possibly say. And you know why he was able to? Because he knew you, because you've opened up to this person. And, once again, he broke your trust in a horrific way.  To let them to get to you with those words is the same as getting depressed when somebody straightforwardly says ""I am trying to hurt you, so please hurt as much as possible. Go!"" He used what he knew would hurt most. He used the years he has known you for against you. He stooped sooooo low, that the only thing you should be taking from that message is that he is the worst human being you've come across so far. And now he is out of your life because you are extraordinarily strong. ",1765
53foa6,"My husband Eric and I have been married for 5 years. We have one child, a four-year-old little lady named Katherine. We both work busy jobs but I'm a writer and I usually work from home or from my office down the street. Our live-in nanny, Ella [45F], has been with us for about six months. She is INCREDIBLE at her job, and she's honestly become part of the family.  The other day Katherine, my husband and I were driving somewhere in the car and my daughter said, ""Want to hear me talk like Ella?"" And she started speaking Spanish! I'm not fluent but I know enough to know that she was really speaking it, not just pretending. I was really impressed and told her great job, keep practicing, etc. My husband didn't really respond but I didn't think anything of it at the time.   Then tonight (just now) Ella came to my office after Eric got home and took over watching Katherine. She was really quiet which isn't like her, and she apologized for teaching Katherine Spanish without asking. My response was basically, um...what? I told her (completely confused) that I had no problem with that and I actually think it's a fantastic idea. I wish somebody had taught me when I was little -- especially where we live in Southern California, it's a great skill to have. So I reassured her that I would actually appreciate it if she would keep teaching Katherine the language. Ella then told me that Eric had just asked her to please only speak English around Katherine.   Ella has gone back to our house for the night, but I'm still sitting in my office fuming. I am beyond furious with Eric, and I know I need to collect myself before going home and speaking to him. First of all, I feel like he's damaged our relationship with Ella, who's been nothing but wonderful to us and our daughter. Secondly, I cannot for the life of me understand why it's a bad thing for our young daughter to learn a very useful second language (which she'll probably have to learn later in school anyway). Eric has never expressed any racism (if he had, we wouldn't be married; that's a dealbreaker for me), but I can't see any other explanation for this. And finally, I am furious that he made the decision to talk to Ella without me. That's not how a partnership should work.   A) Where do I begin in addressing this with him?  and B) How do I make it clear to Ella that she's free to speak whatever language she wants around our daughter?    ---      **tl;dr**: Our amazing nanny has been teaching our 4 year old daughter Spanish, and my husband asked her to stop without discussing it with me first.","I'm in medical school, and one of my good friends in class grew up with a nanny who taught him Spanish, and he is still fluent to this day. So many of our patients are Spanish-speaking-only, and they are blown away when this white dude with a Jew fro walks in and speaks to them in their native language. He doesn't have to wait for an interpreter like the rest of us. I am *so* jealous and wish I had paid more attention in Spanish class because it's a big advantage to have. ",3022
53q92i,"Hi reddit. My fiancee Ali and I have been together for 4 years, living together for 2, recently got engaged. Our relationship has been great for the most part, one of the few things we disagree on is animals. I love animals and Ali feels indifferent towards most animals.  To give a little background about me - I've always been an animal lover. Throughout my childhood, my mom hated animals, especially dogs. My mom never let us have any pets and she used to tell us that once we were adults we could have whatever animals we wanted.  When I moved away for college, I lived on campus for 4 years (and therefore couldn't have any pets). I've wanted a dog for as long as I could remember, but up until recently it wasn't in the cards for me to have a dog. Ali and I currently live in a not-so-pet-friendly city for renters. I always lived in apartments that never allowed pets, even with a pet deposit.  When Ali and I met I told her about wanting to get a dog someday. Ali told me that she doesn't like a lot of dogs, but would be open to the right dog. This was in the very beginning of us meeting - I basically made it really clear that I will own a dog one day. Throughout our relationship, I would occasionally bring up wanting a dog. Ali would remind me that our apartment doesn't allow for pets (which was true). Ali and I agreed that once we moved into a place that allowed for pets, we would look into getting a dog.  About 2 months ago Ali and I moved into a house just outside of the city we work in. The house is a good size for the 2 of us (plus extra), the landlord is pet-friendly, and the house has a huge, fenced in yard. It's a much more residential area, and there's a dog park about 3 blocks from the house.  On top of the house being perfect for a dog, I'm in a financial place where I can afford a dog. I make very good money and I don't have to travel for work. I'm mentally prepared for potential pet fees and other expenses for having people watch the dog.  Since we're finally settled in the house, I decided to mention to Ali again about going to the shelter and looking at the adoptable dogs. Only this time, Ali didn't have an excuse for why we couldn't get one. After a few weak excuses (i.e. sometimes we go away), Ali broke down and told me that she doesn't want a dog. In fact, she's never wanted a dog. She was hoping I would forget about my dreams of wanting a dog.  I'm not sure what to do. I'm trying to reason with Ali but she said her answer will always be ""no"" to a dog. She just doesn't like them and doesn't want them. She basically gave me an ultimatum - either her, or my potential dog.  I'm feeling shitty about this, because I always made it clear to her that I was going to want a dog someday. I feel like she was banking on something unrealistic, and now she's putting me in a lousy spot.  Is there a way to compromise on this?  TL;DR - Girlfriend and I can finally get a dog, she admitted that she doesn't want a dog and never has. She gave me an ultimatum - either her or a dog.   ","I think the bigger issue is the way she communicates and has basically lied to you about something that is really important to you.  It is a big breach of trust.  I think that is something that needs to be considered carefully.  She has now put you in the horrible position of being ""the bad guy"" who she would tell people picked a ""dog"" over her!  When the reality is that she has intentionally misled you about something that she knows is very important to you - or at best, completely discounted something that is very important to you.  She isn't treating you with respect or like a partner.  ",3487
53w447,"My husband ""Nick"" was married to his first wife ""Vanessa"" for 5 years and they had two amazing kids, ""Luke"" (15/M) and ""Lila"" (13/F). Sadly, Vanessa died in an accident 11 years ago when the kids were very young. I started dating Nick 8 years ago and we started off very slowly for obvious reasons. Nick has always been a little more distant than anyone I'd ever been with, but he and the kids lost Vanessa so young that I understood it.  After 3 years of dating, Nick asked me to marry him and I moved in. I've always had a really great relationship with Luke and Lila and they were happy for me to marry their dad. I had wanted an actual wedding, nothing big, but Nick really didn't want one so we got married at the courthouse with just Luke and Lila present. We had a really fast engagement, but it worked for all of us.  I have loved being Luke and Lila's stepmom and officially adopted them after I found out I was pregnant with our son ""Casey"" (2/M). The kids have been so great with Casey and help out so much. Nick was wonderful during the pregnancy and had always been a really loving dad and husband.  But Nick has been pulling away a lot the last few months. He's been even more distant than usual and working late nights and going away with friends almost every weekend. I've tried talking to him, but he's been impatient with both me and the kids. I found out I was pregnant in June and am now 21 weeks pregnant with a girl. The kids are excited to have a little sister, but Nick just seems so indifferent to everything and everyone. He's been missing soccer games, Lila's birthday, doctors appointments, etc. Casey is too young to notice, but Luke and Lila are so hurt by their dad's absence. These kids are so good and they lost their mom so young and I'm infuriated that Nick is ignoring the kids like this.  Last week, I finally sat Nick down and told him that he needs to stop disappearing and be more present in our lives. We're going to have another child soon and before we know it Luke and Lila will be grown up and going to college. After an hour of arguing, he screamed at me that he wished Vanessa was still alive and that I had switched places with her and died instead. He also threw in some awful comments that I need to stop pretending I'm Luke and Lila's ""real"" mom and that I'm only half the mom Vanessa was. The final straw was him saying that he never even wanted any kids with me, but did it so I'd ""keep busy and leave him alone."" I'm so beyond hurt right now. I know I'm just his second choice, but I've always tried to honor Vanessa and tell Luke and Lila how lucky they were to have her as their mom. I love ALL of our kids more than anything and I'm just so heartbroken. Nick barely pays attention to Casey now and doesn't even acknowledge the pregnancy. He somewhat apologized this weekend and took all three kids to lunch, but he won't even look me in the eye. He seems like he wants to talk, but he doesn't say anything and I'm too upset to even be near him.  I'm not sure where to go from here. Honestly, I can't even be around Nick right now and if there weren't any kids involved, I'd leave and never look back. I'm not sure if he's cheating or the thought of a fourth child is stressing him out, but I'm devastated and not sure how or why I should save this marriage, besides doing it for the kids. Any advice is desperately needed right now.      ---      **tl;dr**: My husband has been distant and ignoring our kids. When I confronted him, he told me he wished I had died instead of his first wife and that I'm only half the mother she was. I'm currently pregnant and not sure how to fix this or us. ","There has got to be something else going on. Honestly, it sounds like you are describing affair behavior. Late nights, distance, missed opportunities, disappearing every weekend, blaming you. There has got to be something else going on. ",3135
54bqmy,"Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4t0r8j/how_do_me_and_my_friends_20sf_tell_our_other/ First of all I’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who posted something helpful and constructive . Every comment was read, even the negative (unfortunately). I’ve gotten quite a few messages to post an update over the past month. I initially held off because I was nervous about the surprising amount of attention it got and didn’t know whether Lily was an avid redditor or not. So, despite our protests, Lily ended up bringing her toddler Elle on our cottage getaway. Just kidding! Within 24 hours of me posting, three of us got together and read over all the messages (now my friends know my reddit username….hiii guysss :/ ). We realized that we needed to get down to business and nip this situation in bud, before things escalated/we felt anymore resentment. While this situation was happening, another one was going on on the side. My friend Ivy had made comments in the past about her and Lily drifting apart, as they are best friends. Quite understandably, Lily is SUPER busy being an awesome mom/fulltime employee so its hard getting friend time in. However, Ivy commented that they had only seen each other twice in past two and some months, and how she seemed like the only one ever making plans to hang out. She’s also the best communicator out of the group, so she decided that she would take it upon herself to speak with Lily directly that night. We didn't want to approach Lily as a group because it would have felt like we were attacking her, so we were more than happy with this approach. From what I was told, she started off by casually bringing up the cottage and how much she was looking forward to it. Lily mentioned that she was excited to spend some time with all of us and that she couldn’t wait. Ivy then led the conversation in the direction of how she really loves spending time with Lily, that she wished it could happen more often, and even though she understood that Lily was a very busy gal, she felt like she was losing touch with Ivy somewhat. Lily agreed, but reiterated that it is hard to find time for all the things that are important to her. So, Ivy continued and said something like, “Hey, I am SO excited to be spending time with you at the cottage this summer. However, it kind of hurt my feelings that it took your fiancée to be leaving for the weekend for you to decide to come and spend the weekend with us. (Not sure if I mentioned this in the first post, but initially Lily said no to the cottage because she wanted to focus on her family all summer. However, her fiancee wanted his own mini vacation, and when she found out it was on the same weekend as ours, she finally decided to come). But that’s okay, I understand that family time is very important to you. I just feel that since we haven’t been getting a lot of time to see you lately, the cottage weekend would be a great place for us all to reconnect. I feel like you need a break from life for just a couple days, since you’ve got so much going for you, and having Elle stay with your family friend while your fiancée is away is the perfect opportunity for you to get some one on one time with us. What do you think?” So I’m excited to say that Lily finally saw the light and realized that yeah, this was a great opportunity to kick her feet back, relax, and made plans for Elle to stay with her family friend. So some of you may be upset that we didn’t take the direct route that many of you were advising, demanding that Elle couldn’t come to the weekend getaway. However, we wanted to keep things calm/courteous and Ivy did a great job managing it. It might have been indirect, but it solved two problems in one. All in all, the cottage was even more fun than last year! It was filled with many two-fours, midnight swims, silly truth or dares questions, and too many bags of sour cream and onion chips. tl;dr: Elle didn't come and we had a blast :)","Good for Ivy for being such a good communicator.  She focused on not blaming anyone and presented a solution that made everyone happy, all while being compassionate about Lily's new very hectic schedule as a working mother.  This was all buttressed by all of you being understanding about the issues that come with new parenthood.  Good for everyone here and I'm glad y'all had a good time.",1867
54vs4v,"Previous: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53plis/me_30f_with_my_bf_30m_duration_i_want_to_send_him/  I just want to thank everyone who commented on my previous post. This issue is such a non-issue that I can't believe how seriously you all took me. All the tips, caution, the encouragement just reminded me how wonderful everyone here can be.  Thanks to you guys and the post I made, I was reminded of all the wonderful qualities and reasons I fell in love with my boyfriend and I decided to send him some pictures. It took awhile to find one I felt comfortable with, but I did find one! I know some people think I shouldn't, but I did include my face in it because I feel like it helped show how much I trust Ben and how much I love him.  I waited until the late evening when he told me how he was getting ready for head off to bed when I messaged him with a picture and then sent ""More surprises when you get back ;)"" and I'll admit, I got a little panicky. After a few minutes, Ben sent a message back with ""Oooh very sexy! <3"" and pretty much that was that (Outside of our usual goodnights and I love yous).  I'll admit it, reddit, I didn't know how to take his message back on account of having never sent a photo like this before. Was he being nice? Was this a typical response which was good? Should he have said more? Should I have said more? I didn't know how to feel other than a little disappointed, especially with how long it took me to take the photo. Alongside this, Ben sent me a message the next day telling me about how busy he'll be and then never responded back. I got upset and started feeling like I made a mistake. I spent my day off work with a mix of disappointment, regret and panic, a panic that I had made a huge mistake.  Well, that afternoon I got a knock at my door and who was there? Ben. That's who was at my door. Ben and a bunch of flowers. I wasn't expecting him for a few more days and before I could say anything he told me about how he pulled a favor with his boss (whom he's friendly with) and because the team had pretty much finished up their project he got the go ahead to head home early. Ben told me that he saw the picture and was speechless for a few minutes because he had never expected anything like that from me but knew he had to get home right away to see me. And then he said he felt like the luckiest man in the world.  We've spent every day together since and we've had a fabulous time and I've never felt better about my relationship and about myself. Ben has already asked if he'll get another picture anytime soon. I told him ""Only if you're good"" :)  tl;dr: Sent picture, discovered I now need to get a full wardrobe of sexy lingerie. I feel great!","I'm glad it worked out! Also, don't overthink responses like that (""Oooh very sexy! <3""). When my lady sends me a sexy pic (which I love) there's only so much appreciation I can fit into a text response without feeling like im forcing it.",1391
566iga,"I realize I'm older than most here, if not all of you. But internet has been my best friend in old age and I frequent this subreddit regularly.  I have two sons and a daughter (51, 50 and 44). I haven't talked to my sons in about 25 years and my daughter in 20 years. They chose to cut me off permanently and I respected their decision. With my history of mental illness they had every right to do that. I had problems with narcissistic personality disorder and anger which took many decades for me to overcome and I'm still fighting my demons to this day. I'm living the final months of my life. I have terminal cancer and will soon be gone from this world. I promised them to respect their wishes and I have for 25 years but deep in my heart I do wish to see them again, maybe to apologize for one last time before I'm gone. I don't know if I am being selfish as I can also apologize in my will. I want to do what is best for them. Will they be interested in seeing me before I die? There are considerable assets that I have which I am leaving all of it to them so they will hear about my death.  If you can provide some advice about my situation I will be grateful. You're all closer to my children or grandchildren's age and can see things from their eyes better than I can.    ---      **tl;dr**: I'm dying and have not spoken to my children in 25 years per their request. I am not sure if I should let them know that I'm dying. --- I never expected so much advice and love from you. I thank you all and I'm reading everything to come to my final decision. ","I will start by saying: For children to cut off a parent, that parent has to have done something that really, really upsetting, something so hurtful, so unforgivable. And for them to maintain that silence for 25 years reinforces just how bad it must have been. So, whatever happens between now and your death, or between now and them hearing from the executors of your will, you need to accept that they may never forgive you, in this world or the next.  That out of the way:  Write a letter to each of them. Apologise. Tell them you love them. Ask for forgiveness. Explain what you have done in those 25 years to try to become a better person. Apologise again. Maybe ask for one last meeting or some photos or a letter in return. But do not make excuses for whatever you did, because that will immediately put them off you forever - whatever you did to make kids abandon you for 25 years, my guess is that it is inexcusable.  And don't wag a will at them. Any bequest should be a surprise and a bonus. If you mention it now *even if the intention is to demonstrate your contrition*, it will look to them as if  you are trying to buy their love back. Good luck.  And if they don't reply you must respect that and leave them alone their new lives, without re-opening old wounds. Maybe just a quick call from the nurse as you are sinking.",6314
56sgxk,"I'm sorry for the length! I'm just really confused and emotional right now. tl:dr at the bottom.  Background: I volunteer as a videographer and photographer at a local church. All video and photo equipment is paid for out of my own pocket, and I do not receive any donations for my equipment or expenses. Which is fine, they do good work in a bad neighborhood, and I'm happy to lend my amateur services for free as a hobbyist. I've known the pastors' family for a very long time (17 years), and they have provided me with food and a place to stay numerous times during my turbulent childhood.  The media department has a windowed office within the church. There are patterns on the windows so you can't see inside, but it's common knowledge to everyone but visitors that our equipment is in there. There are two keys, one of which I have, and the other belongs to my partner.  A couple of weeks ago, the pastor's son asked me if he could borrow my camera. He said that it's ""just shooting a video, not that hard"". I declined, so he asked me if I could ""shoot a music video for him"" He said he'd compensate me and I agreed, knowing that once he realized how much work was actually needed he would reconsider. Anyway, we decided to do it that weekend, and I told him to call me during the week so I could verify my availability, and that Friday was my birthday, so it would have to be before or after then.  I hear nothing from him the entire week.  On Friday around 5am, he called me five times. I responded with a text saying that it was my birthday, and that I would be available the next day. He responded ""Alright"".  The following Sunday I go into the office and notice that there's a piece missing from my DSLR. My small RODE microphone is also missing. The settings are changed to auto and the picture style is set to monochrome, which is weird because I never use them.  At first I brush it off, thinking that I lost the stuff and just can't remember where I put it, and that maybe I was messing with the settings and lost the pieces myself. It's not likely, but my memory is pretty bad, so I let it go. Plus, the booth was locked and the door intact, so I had no reason to believe that someone broke in.  During the next week I lost my keys, so I was unable to do any volunteer work. I came in on Sunday to let them know, and the Pastor walks up to me and *hands me my camera*. She goes ""the office was left open, so I borrowed the camera. [Son] wants one so I wanted to see the model"".  Okay. Never mind that she's seen the camera hundreds of times, but okay. Sure. So I go over to the office that was ""left open"" to find that it's locked. Weird. Maybe my partner came during the week and left it open.  So I let my partner know later on in the week and they go put it back in the office and locked it behind them. They cleaned up my ""mess"" (as they put it), and also believed that *I* must have left the door unlocked.  Fast forward to this Sunday. I notice that the leftmost window has screws missing. The window is loose, and I'm able to pull it away from the wall and reach my hand inside. That's when I notice that my camera is also missing. I call my partner, and they say to take picture evidence. We confront the pastor, who admits that it was her son that took it, and that she was covering for him. I ask about my camera and the missing equipment, and she says that I should have kept it locked up better (?!) and that I should have come to her when I first noticed something weird. Whatever, but okay. But he still has to replace the fucking camera right? Or at least give back the one he stole? Wrong. Apparently he has ""two daughters to feed, so he can't afford to buy a thousand dollar camera"" and she ""doesn't know where it is or what he did with it"".  At this point, I have of course told them that I'm done volunteering for them. But I am torn about whether I should pursue this legally because of everything their family did for me in the past. I feel so betrayed and worthless. How could they treat me and my things with so little respect? They are supposed to be better than this.   **tl:dr** pastors son stole my camera, they don't care. Their family took care of me when I had nowhere to go, so I'm torn about pursuing this. Advice needed. Edit: It was suggested that I add this to my post as it may clear up why I am so reluctant to involve the police: Among other things, when I was 16, I was homeless and the pastor's family took me on for a year. They fed me and gave me a bed free of charge, and the Pastor stayed up late to make sure I had a hot meal to take to work every single day. With the exception of this incident, they have been very involved and concerned with my well being since I was a child. I feel extremely betrayed, but I am also not comfortable taking action (that involves the police) against them.   Edit 2: I'm really surprised this got so much of a response, and unfortunately although there was more sound advice than not, I'm even more confused than when I started. The overwhelming consensus seems to be to go to the police, which I am still uncomfortable with although willing to at this point. From what I'm reading, though, it seems that notifying the pastor ahead of time to see if we can find a better solution is illegal on my part, and falls under the category of extortion.  I've decided that I'm just going to go to the free legal aid office near my job, as I can at the very least get free counseling in regards to this issue before I decide to involve the police. Thank you so, *so* much for your support, r/relationships I was really feeling alone and betrayed about this, and many of your answers cleared a lot up for me.  There's no way I can fit all of the details and reasoning behind my reluctance to burn this particular bridge in this one post, so I'll just say that there's more to our relationship, many gray areas, and more sensitive issues that go into this. There's no way I can respond to all of you, but I still want to thank those of you who responded. I appreciate all of the advice given (and believe me, I've read every one). ","You file a police report, I feel like the threat of the law will get this pastor reconsider things. Theft is theft, this pastor admitted it knowing it was her son who did it. ",2373
56sijj,"Original Post: https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55zq1c/me_26m_with_my_livein_girlfriend_26f_10_years_she/?st=iu45ko64&sh=99d7b298 Hey guys I got some really good feedback to my post that made talking to my girlfriend a lot easier and I'm so happy so I thought I owed those posters an update! After reading all the comments and reflecting on our relationship I decided the recent lack of sex was not the problem but just the symptom of a much greater issue, my girlfriend's stress. Like I said in the original post, I was weary to bring these issues up because I did not want to add additional stress to my girlfriend's situation, she has enough to worry about right now. I had mentioned that weekends are her least busy times and that is when we get things done around the house and hang out with friends. Some users said we should focus less on being social and more on ourselves, and someone else suggested that I try to get more done during the week so we can relax more on the weekend. So on Thursday and Friday I got up early and did everything we needed to do this weekend, cleaned the whole house, did our meal prep (something we usually do Saturday) and got all the laundry taken care of. We're finishing our basement and this weekend was going to be the carpet, so I went to Lowe's and bought everything Thursday and banged it out alone on Friday. She noticed the whole house being cleaned Friday night and was really relieved that we didn't have to take care of it this weekend. On Saturday we got up and that was when she realized I had taken care of the carpet and everything else. It was awesome, she was giddy with excitement because she pretty much had nothing to do all weekend. So I asked what she wanted to do and it was stereotypical Fall couple stuff; went and got pumpkins and mums for our porch, went and got some new Fall decorations and candles and then just hung around the house being lazy. While I worked out and walked the dog she did a bit of work to get ahead so she wouldn't be as busy this week. We ate dinner and since we were in a Fall mood we watched Hocus Pocus.  On Sunday we slept in for the first time in ages... well first time for her, I sleep in all the time, don't judge me. We continued the fall theme and went apple picking. We came home and I made an apple pie. She started doing some work but after about a half hour she said screw it, went for a run and then came home and relaxed. We went to her mom's for a big Sunday dinner and when we got home I decided it was time to talk to her about her unsustainable stress situation.  I told her I loved her and was in it for the long term but that I was worried about her and that her current situation wasn't healthy. She started crying, she thought I was sitting her down to break up with her! She knows that the way she's working isn't healthy but she didn't think it would go on this long. She kept thinking to herself ""just a few more days and I'll get into a flow...just another week..."" and before she knew it it's been 3 months and she's still pulling her hair out. I wasn't going to talk about the lack of sex but she brought it up and apologized. She said her problem isn't the lack of a sex drive/attraction but that she's just exhausted all the time.  After we talked, I gave her a big hug, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex! woo! It's Columbus day today so we both are off and it happened again this morning, double woo!! Some people had suggested I say we schedule some times to hang out which I was against, but my girlfriend suggested something very similar. Saturday night is now the night we make a point to have sex. It used to happen naturally a couple times a week, but with her new schedule that probably isn't going to happen. Saturday night is now our designated night to stay in and make dinner or go on a date with just the two of us and then go home and have sex haha. So in conclusion, I'm going to take care of more of the housework so our weekends are less busy and we are going to make it a point to have sex at least once a week. We used to divide it pretty equally but I have a hell of a lot more free time during the week than she does. Also, communication communication, communication. I was thinking this was the beginning of the end, and after a few days and one honest conversation I think everything is going to be just fine.    ---      **tl;dr**: Busted my ass last week to get all our housework/responsibilities taken care of before the weekend. Hung out and had a great weekend together. Discussed our situation Sunday night, we figured out a system that will work, and then we finally had sex! I'm going to shoulder more housework/random crap during the week so we can relax together on weekends.  **Edit**: so I guess this post is locked so I'm sorry if I was unable to respond to you guys but I did read all the responses. Thank you for all the support I really didn't think this post would get so much attention!

56xjru,"About 8 years ago I decided that I don't want to live around people anymore. This isn't about something that happened or me thinking people are bad or other crazy thoughts, I just could never fit with people. I never had friends, but never felt like I needed them either. I think I might be somewhere in the autism spectrum but I don't have an official diagnosis. I'm cool and fine on my own. I grew up in NYC and finally decided that the environment there is no good for me. I decided to move to a different state, buy some cheap land in a very small village and built a house for myself. The only people I interact with in person on a daily basis are the people at the market where I buy stuff and when something is delivered to me. To be honest, it's the best decision I've ever made. I'm much happier and more comfortable. I have a lot of online friends. I'm a software engineer and make apps and games. I can work from the comfort of my own home and the living costs are so low that I have no stress about money. I've already made enough to last me 30 more years of living like this. Now my family are the only people that I have some sort of emotional connection with. I have a more or less good relationship with all of them especially my younger sister who visits me quite often. The thing is, they all say they miss me. They want me to come back living in NYC, they say I should get out of my solitary life and start a family for myself. I can't do those things. And my parents are calling me selfish for not even trying. I feel really bad when they're upset at me, it feels like everyone I know is upset so I must have done something wrong. I'm not good at communicating these feelings. I think they thinks I'm sad because I'm lonely but I'm not. It's by choice.  First, do you think I'm selfish? I know they want what's best for me I just don't think they know what is best for me. And second, is it selfish of me to not give things another try in NYC?   ---      **tl;dr**: I choose to live alone away from cities. My family want me to work harder to fit in.","There is a line between being *selfish*, and *living life as you choose*.  YOU are *living life as you choose* = you are not selfish THEY want YOU to live YOUR life the way THEY choose =  they are selfish Easy.

Strange enough I think I needed to hear the advice from people I didn't know, rather than friends and family who have been hounding me for a long time.   I guess deep down inside, I always thought I deserved better but my self esteem has been lacking for so long that I thought my fiance was the best that I could do.   I honestly believe now that he has many priorities ahead of me.  One of you asked whether I thought he would drop everything if I ever got into an accident.  I'm not sure he would, and that scares me.   Last night, I gathered up the courage to confront him about everything: the lack of romance, the lack of dates, the fact that he won't pay for anything or contribute any ideas to our wedding, and sadly, he didn't really react.  He just told me he couldn't discuss it now and needed to deal with something at work.   I'm heartbroken and ended it on the spot.  While I'm sure I made the right choice, I'm still so lost.  I'm 30 and now single.  I wanted to be married by now and have kids.  Feels like I'm starting over.  Hoping for the best, but 40 or 50 more years of what I have now would have been miserable.   Thank you all for freeing me.  I'm just trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces.     ---      **tl;dr**: Broke up with fiance for not caring about me or our relationship.  Trying to pick up the pieces.  ","I'm impressed, do you realize how many people would have sadly caved when they heard ""I can't discuss this now, got work stuff."" How many women in your position would've thought, ""OK, well at least I said what I needed to say and he's not mad, hopefully we can talk about it more this weekend."" Cue another year gone before she even realizes it.  But that's not you! You saw through his bullshit and ended it. Seriously, I hope you feel really good about that.  That relationship wasn't a waste of time, you're now better equipped to spot the warning signs even earlier, and you have a much better idea of the kind of man you want to marry. Many people would've gone through with the wedding hoping it'd get better, but that's a fantasy. Be proud of yourself for not falling into that trap.",2476
5e1mg2,"**Update** I'd like to thank everyone for all of the kind words and incredible advice that they have sent through both threads. I have not been able to respond to everyone, but please be assured that I have read every one of your comments, and I appreciate them all. Everyone is doing well on our end, and while the pain is still immense, sharing memories ad photos with his friends has helped a lot. I'm so proud of him and everything he did in his short time with us. Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5cuvee/i_59_m_recently_lost_my_son_26_and_dont_know_how/   I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my first thread. Your words were so kind and helped me out with a difficult situation. I'd also like to offer an apology, as I feel I misstated some things in my original post. My difficulty was not from finding out what kind of person my son was just before his death. Additionally, I got lots of posts giving advice to the likes of ""I would let them speak,"" which baffled me slightly, as I hadn't thought that that's what I was asking. I had never considered keeping them out of the funeral and letting them speak their words, however when I re-read my original post, I can see how I didn't make it clear that I was already working with them on delivering their speeches. For this lack of clarity, I sincerely apologize. However, I read all of the comments in full, and I greatly appreciate everyone's input. To update, the funeral took place yesterday was was, perhaps fittingly, a weirdly wonderful affair. My wife his, younger sister and I spoke, as did 4 of his friends. We decided to hold the funeral in his adopted city rather than here for 2 reasons: First was because we all know he loved that city so much, and Second was to make it easier for his friends to attend. (I should state, pretty much everyone in our hometown was in a position to travel, but his friends aren't, as they are students and it's midterm season for them.) Although people had reached out to me, I was stunned by turnout. I didn't get a proper headcount, but the room that I though was relatively large was down to standing room only.  The family's speeches and 3 of his friends were relatively normal for a funeral, and recounted fond memories of his life and personality. The 4th friend to speak was not. Quite simply, he wanted to roast my son, namely in the style of a comedy central roast. When he pitched the idea to me, I was a little hesitant, but I decided to give him his moment. Part of it was one of the few aspects of my son that remained constant throughout his life: he hated tradition for tradition's sake. He was always someone who would question (sometimes at unfortunately inappropriate times) why everything is the way it is. Think along the lines of ""Why is the bride supposed to wear white?"" while acutaly at a wedding. A second part of my decision to allow it was because a common theme I found out through his friends was that he was quite a joker himself towards the end, and would do anything for a laugh, going as far as making himself the butt of the joke just to get a positive reaction from them. Finally, I agreed because he was completely upfront with me about what he wanted to say (he handed me his script) and said that if I was uncomfortable with it or the idea, that he would still be honoured if he could give a more traditional speech.  This led me to the one difficult in the funeral, namely, where do I put this joker? Do I do it at the beginning to set a tone, or at the end to leave on a high? I discussed with my wife and his friend, and we agreed on a compromise, where he would give a short talk at the beginning to set the mood that wouldn't be all sad, and then he delivered his main set at the end, so we could all leave without tears in our eyes. So, as weird as it might sound, I think we all had fun at the funeral, and I was incredibly touched to have met so many of his friends. While I still sort of feel that I' mourning 2 people, I was so proud that my son broke out of his shell when he left. I know his friends are wonderful people, and I can only imagine how happy my son was up to the end.    ---      **tl;dr**: The funeral went well, and I was touched by the support his friends showed.","One great sign of a wonderful person is how many people are smiling while talking at the funeral and calling hours. My grandpa died when I was five and my memory of it is laughing while someone I don't think I ever saw again bounced me on their leg.  It's fucking awful that you have lost your son so early but he sounds like he made a lot of people smile during his short life. In your original post you sounded out of sorts about not knowing the man he grew into. This is a pretty common part of growing up and it sounds like he was in the weird transition stage between 'college kid' and 'grown man'. It's not out of the ordinary for you to lose touch in that period while he finds himself. I know I act very different with people I made friends with as adults versus the people I knew while I was young and awkward. It doesn't mean that he didn't feel comfortable being his 'new self' around you, it just means you were robbed of the opportunity to get to know each other on even footing as independent adults. I am so sorry that you didn't get to know him as the people his friends knew- I hope they shared as much as they could with you about the man they loved. It was incredibly generous of you to hold a service in the city for their benefit. I hope you got some great stories out of it.",257
5e43ld,"[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50tf15/me_34f_with_my_husband_40m_married_11_years_w_2/) It's been about 10 weeks since my post. Here's what happened.  The evening after I made that post, I told my husband there is no way we will be able to work everything out on our own, and we need to go to counseling. He reluctantly agreed.  We started couples counseling the very next week. It's realy quite strange how counseling has progressed.  1. My husband made one change - stopping with the yelling - immediately and totally. He hasn't yelled at me over little things for weeks now.  2. BUT I have progressively gotten more and more angry with, disappointed in, and disconnected from him because of everything he's said and done during these weeks in counseling.... which also caused me to sort of wake up to all that he has done in the past. I have an appointment with a lawyer next week. We are done.  \#2 takes a bit of explanation, so here goes.  I am quite stunned by how little effort this guy is willing to put into the relationship in spite of so desperately wanting to hold on to it. So he made one change - the end of all yelling. I was really, really relieved and grateful and impressed.... until he started complaining (about 4 days in!) that he was putting in all the effort and seeing ""negative returns"". This has remained his stance for all these 10-11 weeks.  I am flabbergasted. Our couples counselor has straight up said to him: ""I am supposed to be neutral here but on this I am comfortable saying you are WRONG, she is making a huge effort at this relationship and you need to know that."" But in private my husband dismisses everything I'm doing as ""intangible"" or ""selfish"" and therefore not real. And he complains nonstop that I'm not my ""usual self"" i.e. the doormat who danced around managing his feelings and walking on eggshells all the time. ""This is not the person I fell in love with,"" he keeps saying. ""Why should I bother making all this effort?""   For my part, yes, I am not the person he fell in love with. The couples counselor told me to stop trying to manage his feelings for him and try to be myself - and I took that very seriously. I no longer try to read his mood all the time and tiptoe around him. I no longer try to intuit when he is angry or hurt and ask him what's wrong and try to cajole him into working things out. I leave it to him to bring it up with me if something is bothering him. If he's in a bad mood and sulking, I just leave him alone and go on with my own thing until he wants to talk. If he is stonewalling me, which he has started doing for a few days after every single counseling session, I no longer let it affect my mood. This seems to be making him feel completely unloved and abandoned - which I only know because he has broken down and cried and yelled at me after the stonewall. ""You don't care about me anymore."" And I've been saying, ""If something is bothering you, you need to tell me. I won't read your mind. And I won't cave to your freezeouts."" Cue his standard line, ""What effort are you making in this relationship? Why am I the only one who's doing anything here? Why should I continue to do this work when you are being so selfish?""  The stoppage of yelling was homework from the very first session. He did that. But subsequent sessions' homework has been things like, ""Go on a date this week"" and ""Make one show of affection as soon as you're home from work"" and ""Make time for conversation before bedtime"" etc. -- all of which have been spectacular failures. On our ""date"" he refused to so much as hold my hand and spent all his time wandering off on his own (we were at a museum) - and when I brought it up later he got massively pissed saying ""WE WENT ON A DATE WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT"".  The  show of affection - well, he used to do it if he came home later than me, but if I come home from work later than him, he is always distracted and does not reciprocate my hug *even after I point it out*, and now since he started stonewalling me for days after each counseling session, I haven't even tried to do this homework because fuck it, who wants to hug a stonewaller (same goes for conversation before bedtime).  This shit has really woken me up, y'all. I don't know what sort of fantasy I had constructed out of whole cloth that made me love this guy. He really doesn't want to lift a finger. He seems to lose it completely at the thought of my leaving - cries, seems desperate - but it translates into ZERO action. He really doesn't care about me at all.  Anyway - I said as much to him early this week and told him I am leaving. Next week I have an appointment with an attorney to see what my options are. This shit is really happening. I am leaving. I am scared as shit and my emotions are fucking fried but I have never been more sure of anything.      ---       **tl;dr**: 10 weeks of actually talking about our relationship for the first time in 11 years - that's all it took to wake me up to the reality that I married a ridiculously selfish man. Fuck. :( ",I am SO proud of you for coming to terms with who he is and realizing you deserve better. It's a really hard thing to do and judging from your past post as well as this one i think you will get on marvelously without him!,1371

Link to the op: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5d299h/my_sister_23f_thinks_that_marrying_her_bf_27m_and/ Just wanted to say that my sister and her boyfriend decided to break up. And also that she's not getting pregnant and marrying him anymore. As some people advised me, I called my brother and asked him to help me. He came over on Thursday and had a serious talk with her.  He told her to think about the future. Don't think about right now. Think about your life in 10, 20, 30 years. Kids won't fix a broken relationship and heartbreak isn't the worst thing in the world, she doesn't own anything to that guy, but years down the line if she decides to marry him, she'll have to deal with her awful relationship and take care of other human beings with him. At first she couldn't accept it but after thinking about it, she decided that they should break up. Her boyfriend didn't seem upset at all and even though she's sad now, she'll get better and keep focusing on her education, which is important. Now I have to deal with my crazy family. My oldest brother from Europe is coming over on Thanksgiving... wish me luck. Haha But thank you so much for helping me! People here are awesome (sometimes). :) tl;dr: My sister broke up with her boyfriend and decided to keep going to college",So glad this worked out. Your sister was on the verge of making a terrible mistake. You are very mature for your age to be able to recognize that and find the best way to help. Be proud of yourself and happy your sister didn't make an awful mistake. ,683

I will respond to each of you individually. So, to recap: My STBX is a cheating ass, and he panicked and tried to erase his family. The update: This all happened on a Sunday, so there wasn't a lot I could do right then. I put the kids to bed, and called my mom and cried. Then, I called my mother in law, who was horrified. My inlaws came over that night with $200 in cash and a check for much more. My father in law is didn't say much, but he did fix my bathroom door (which is how he shows affection), and muttered that he would ""fix this"". I opened a new checking account at a new bank (THANKS FOR THIS ADVICE) with the check my in laws gave me. I opened a new credit card in my name. My mother deployed a niece to help with childcare for the next week, I called in a lot of childminding favors, and with the cash my inlaws gave me, I was able to pay the babysitter while I worked this out. I met with two divorce attorneys- both of them told me about what you had said, that he was legally screwed. I chose one, and we set the process in motion to get an emergency hearing, but by Tuesday, my old checking account had most of the money back, and my husband was asking to ""talk"". On the advice of my lawyer, I took half of the checking account money and put it in my new bank, and kept records of everything. I pulled our credit reports- He has over $40,000 in credit card debt. I also found out, that he received a raise last year, and funneled this money out of our shared accounts. I would have figured this out when I did our taxes, and this led to him panicking and trying to ""erase"" us. Keep in mind, this asshole gave me gonorrhea. I am an accountant by trade, and I'm afraid of CC debt the way some girls are afraid of spiders, so I was horrified about this, but my lawyer thinks it's likely that he'll have to have this debt on his own, as my name isn't on it, and it seems that most of it was spent on his side piece. We have started mediation, which he agreed to when he realized that he would need to pay for BOTH of our divorce attnys. My goal- which my lawyer thinks is reasonable, is to ask for alimony until I either re-marry (not likely) or my 2 year old is in school full time, and to have a reasonable amount of child support until she's 18, and then we'll split college costs for all of them. When all the kids are in school, I can concentrate on getting back to work. I also plan to sell the house and buy a smaller house in a less elite section of town. The kids can share rooms, and I can live mortgage free. So, I'm heartbroken, and diseased, but there's also an incredible weight that his lifted from me. Our marriage has been bad for so long, and I didn't even realize how unhappy I was, and how.. absent by husband was. It took my 5 year old almost a week to realize that Daddy was gone.",I remember reading the original. I'm glad you came through okay and I'm happy that your in-laws helped you. All too often in this situation people tend to stick by family even when they've done something reprehensible.  The credit card debt on top of everything else is pretty crazy. A person couldn't purposefully set themselves up to utterly ruin their own lives better than he did.,1601

Reading the comments ended up being very emotional- full throat constricting, tears and I had to take breaks because I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the advice.  I did take many people's advice and sort of made it my own. I took a week off work and read /u/Palavras and /u/riendlymarmite suggestions in particular about a memory jar and childhood milestones. Thank you guys and everyone else who mentioned a letter/adoption etc.  I ended up writing a journal that was addressed to them. Once I started I had a really hard time containing how I felt so the letter became quite long. So being the over the top person I am, I ended up on Pinterest, found a tutorial on making your own paper/ 101 book binding and basically wrote a mini journal/letter and then bound it. I also put photos in as well.  I would post pictures but it's a bit unpolished. I didn't want to commission art work or a quilt because I wanted to do it myself but my SO does embroidery and she says can do a little pixel persong a cross stitch portrait  so we're looking into that too - after our children enter the picture! I gave them the journal last weekend. They spent Friday/Saturday reading it, we had a very emotional dinner on Saturday especially after I asked them about adult adoption and changing my surname. They were thrilled! They had thought about it too but didn't want to feel like they were taking something of my identity away or pressure me. Cue more tears to the point of my SO joking about gluing tissue boxes to her person.  This has been a very dehydrating week. Thank you so much reddit, I am so glad I posted here!

60xit1,"About a month ago I posted about my worries on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5uq0sv/me_20s_f_with_my_fellow_student_20s_m_fellow/).  **tl:dr** of original: fellow student often harasses young female students and was applying for a job that would put him in a position of authority over exactly those students he targets. I felt I needed to do something to prevent this from happening.  My special thanks go out to /u/time_keepsonslipping and /u/Pillbot10011 who had a very, *very* good discussion on sexual harassment in academia and how this was quite a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation. However, they did help me see that I actually had a solution that was staring me right in the face.  I went to my mentor, a male professor who's high up the management ladder and actually even responsible for HR for the part of the organization that concerns this story. (Like I said, the solution was *really* staring me right in the face.) I trust this man and I knew he would believe me and follow up on my worries without a second thought.  I wasn't wrong. I went to see him and simply told him something was worrying me deeply and I needed some advice, after which I told him the story. Now, you should know, this man is a very calm and funny guy. This was the first time since I've known him to find him go quiet and to see anger build up in his eyes.  He asked me for the name of this person and I told him who it was. Then he told me he will go to HR straight away to ask about the status of his application, and if needed would use his executive position to veto the application.  He came to see me the next day to tell me the department had already turned down the guy based on his qualifications, so in the end, I was worried for nothing. **However**, we started talking about the subject of (sexual) harassment students may face and how they feel rather helpless because they don't really have anyone to turn to and the system actually discourages students from speak up about it. Turns out this professor has been very, *very* active in trying to implement integrity and equal opportunity policy on a university wide level, but this was only focused on staff, not students. He took it upon him personally to see policy will be revisited on a university level to also include protection for students, not just staff and that he would use my example as the reason why we need to do this as a university. He also told me that in terms of short term action he would personally go to each department head that falls under his jurisdiction to discuss this matter. When I spoke to him again some time later, he told me the department heads weren't really open to even acknowledge the problem (surprise, surprise) let alone do something about it. But he's not the kind of man to take no for an answer, so he's planning to go over their heads and develop some management tools for the whole organizational unit that he hopes will also affect the individual departments.  In the end, I am really glad I took action. Even though in the end, action wasn't needed to prevent the thing I was worried about, I think me speaking up to my mentor has triggered some processes on different levels in the organization that will hopefully lead to some change. I know from experience that this is a very slow process, and I won't notice much change before I'll leave my university, but still, a start was made. If anything, it will lead to more awareness of this issue on different managerial levels. I'm quite happy with how everything turned out.  **tl:dr** - Had a chat with a professor I know high up the ladder in management. Turned out, fellow student wouldn't have gotten the job anyways. However, my chat with that professor triggered - I hope - positive action on a broader, university wide level that will hopefully lead to some positive change in the years to come.

It's been a while, but I remembered this post by chance yesterday and decided to follow up. A lot of people in the original post said that he would likely lose interest within the next couple months. Well, here we are 7 months later, and he's still playing. The thing is, he got my mom to start playing with him! I pretty much never play now, but they have a great time playing together. My mother started in December, but she's already passed me in level and I think she has more Pokemon registered in her pokedex than my dad. I also haven't heard her complain about her foot pain in a while, so I don't think that should be an issue now. He has also stopped asking me so many questions and wanting that to be our only conversation topic, but that's probably also because he is now as experienced in the game as I am, if not more. Over the weekend, we all went out for dinner, and were walking around the outside mall while waiting for our table to be ready. My mom whispered a little ""Omg!"" and showed us that there was a Tyranitar right across the street. For those who don't know, it's an extremely rare pokemon, and I think the most powerful one in the game right now, barring a legendary. We were all able to catch it :) That's really all there is to say, and I think I was just worried that it would devolve into something addictive and unhealthy. But I see now that it's a fun little activity for the both of them, and I am glad we are all able to bond through it. tl;dr: Dad still plays PoGo, got my Mom to play too. Now they're having fun together and working to catch 'em all.","My husband is 43 and I've honestly never seen him move so fast as when there's a special Pokémon somewhere.

694z9h,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rmsqm/i_24f_need_to_tell_a_good_friend_24f_that_she/) It's been a while since I asked for advice on telling my friend she had a strong body odor. It didn't get a lot of attention and it was a good result so I forgot about it. I believe I called her the night I posted and pretty much told her what I said I was going to tell her. I let her know that I really wanted her to get the job and then asked her if she knew she smelled (in a more tactful way - can't remember the exact words). She said she did know and the conversation went from there. She didn't give me the exact reason why and I didn't ask. I mentioned that since our work requires a uniform (I wear mine a few times before washing because it's an office job and I don't sweat), she should be washing hers often if she got the job. She was thankful that I brought it up with her. I followed up with talking about the job and giving her other advice about applying.  She actually did end up getting the job with me (yay!) and has become more hygienic. She's still not the cleanest but she doesn't smell like she used to and her car/room don't have the same heavy odor. To be honest, I forgot for a while that we even talked about this and almost forgot that this was even an issue before. I don't think she really remembers, either. It was a fairly easy conversation once I told her and it didn't change anything about our friendship. I wish I had told her sooner, but I'm glad I did tell her. Kind of a boring update, but a good one. :)      ---      **tl;dr**: Told a friend a while ago that she smelled. She appreciated my honesty, we are still friends and she got the job!","Great update!

6admo7,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/69v77f/i_27f_just_found_out_that_my_teammate_24m/ Hey, My sincere thanks to everyone who replied to my original post with suggestions. I read every comment, though I didn't have the time to respond individually. Here's the update. About an hour after I posted on this sub asking for advice, I did the following 3 things: 1. Sent an email to the entire group, basically saying, ""Hey, this is what I've found, I don't want to accuse anyone of intentional plagiarism, but the school is certainly going to interpret it as such. I need EVERYONE to double-check their sections and confirm to me that they either have no issues with their citations, or that they are working to fix their citations."" 2. Reached out to the professor requesting an urgent phone call. 3. Spent the entire night looking through the entire paper. And guess what I found. Yep, *another person in our group did the same thing with her section.* It was actually even worse than what Guy #1 did, because she would copy/paste information from the same source for 3 or 4 sentences in a row, and then she would only add the footnote at the end of the very last sentence in the paragraph. The next morning (Monday), 2 things happened: 1. Only one person in the group (the 4th person) replied to my email. He confirmed that he did not have any issues with citation in his parts, and volunteered to help me look through the entire paper and check citations against original sources. 2. Our advisor and I had a phone conversation. She was surprisingly accommodating about the whole thing. She said that since I was voluntarily bringing it to her attention before the paper was due, she would be willing to give us some leeway. She gave us a 12-hour extension for submitting the paper, and she promised that after she runs the paper through a plagiarism detection software, if she does spot anything that is suspect of plagiarism, she would discuss it with our team FIRST before taking anything to the academic board or whatever it's called. Guy #4 and I spent all of Monday going through the paper again and pulling every single source that every single person had cited, looking at the exact page numbers in the PDFs and making sure that citations were done correctly. It was an absolutely exhausting, draining, miserable process. Guy #1 and Girl #2 were probably dead or something during this entire time, because we didn't hear a peep from them. We submitted the paper by the extended deadline, and I think we're good to go, even though I wish Guy #1 and Girl #2 had been penalized in some way because I worked so fucking hard to cover their asses. A couple of thoughts: 1. Don't believe anyone who says group projects are a taste of the real world. They are not. I've been working professionally for the last 6 years, and I can tell you, I have never worked with a single person - even government employees - who has been as incompetent, lazy and just a plain dimwitted fucknut as the people I've encountered in grad school. 2. We messed up long before this, by not finishing our paper sooner. Honestly, for me, I was the only person in the group with a full-time job outside of this full-time masters program, so I've been extremely busy, but I know it's not a good enough excuse for procrastinating. I guess I just never imagined that grad students would need someone to educate them about what constitutes plagiarism.  3. Yes, pulling something directly from a source without using quotation marks, even if you have a footnote, is plagiarism -- our advisor confirmed. 4. Don't do group projects! Period! I had the option to do a solo thesis and I chose to go the capstone group project route, because our program heavily discouraged the solo thesis option. Look where it got me!    Thanks everyone. Lesson learned. Never talking to these fuckers again.   ---      **tl;dr**: We got an extension from our advisor to double-check and rework the thesis/capstone. We submitted it and now we should be good to go for graduation. ","Former Harvard professor here. Your professor/advisor did not handle this appropriately or professionally.  She should have asked you for the unedited version, ask you which parts you and member #4 did, run it through the plagiarizer, documented the plagiarism by students #2 and #3, reported students #2 and #3 to the academic board/dean/whatever your school mechanism is, assigned grades to you and #4 based on your sections, given #2 and #3 Fs. Depending on the dean/honor board, etc. decision, either the Fs stand, they are dismissed from the program, or make them re-sumit a different project each written entirely on their own with a short deadline and with significant late penalties. No way you and #4 should have been penalized by having your asses hauled through so much extra work because of #2 and #3 cheating.  Had you not caught the plagiarism before submitting, you and #4 would have been in serious academic trouble. If it were me in your position, I would go straight to the academic board and lay out the whole case beginning to end, including all drafts of the project and including the fact that #2 and #3 did not respond to your email about checking for plagiarism.",3037
6e6hge,"Hi there. I'm writing this on a throwaway because to be honest I never thought I'd need to post here but what can you do. So I moved into this flat about 8 months ago. I met ""Lana"" online on a roommate website, and we clicked well. She's a bit younger but seemed mature. We quickly agreed to be roommates (both of us were under time constraints to find a place to live) but have got on really well so far (up until this). Our flat is a two bedroom, and to be frank, my room is clearly the better one. It's bigger and has built in wardrobes. When looking for the flat, I found the place first on my own and put down a deposit to take it off the market while I found another roommate. The flat was perfect, cheap rent and my aunt manages the property, so I was keen to snap it up before anyone else did. The area it's in is popular so I wasn't really worried about not finding someone to room with. Because of the above and that I was there first, I took the bigger room naturally. When showing potential roommates (including Lana) round, I was sure to show the smaller room and say ""this would be *your* room"". We moved in 8 months ago, and it's been happy families. Never heard Lana complain about her room. Because I have about 6x the wardrobe space that she does, I told her she's welcome to store her off season clothes in there, or whatever she wants to store, as long as she's not popping in every morning to get dressed. She was happy with this. Just over a month ago, I went travelling. Now I'm not the biggest fan of having people in my room, but I told Lana if she had someone stay (her sister, friends from home) they could sleep in my bed. She said thanks, and as she's been such a great roommate and rarely has guests except her boyfriend, I didn't worry at all. I came back yesterday. I was exhausted from the flight and travelling, and just wanted to shower and sleep. As I walked in Lana was in the living room with her boyfriend. We said hello and hugged, had a very quick catch up, blah blah. Then I dragged my suitcase to my room, opened the door and found it full of stuff that was not mine. I kind of yelled ""what the fuck?"" and briefly thought I was so jetlagged I was confused, but opened the door to Lana's room and saw all my stuff. I walked into the living room and asked Lana what was going on and she said ""Oh sorry, I forgot to mention, we put my stuff in your room just because it's bigger and you weren't here and you said I could use it."" I was honestly so tired I could have passed out then, so I probably wasn't in the best state, and told her to move it all back immediately. She said they were in the middle of making dinner and I looked tired so I should have a sleep. Her boyfriend then said ""And anyway, you pay the same rent so isn't it fair that you both get the big room at some point."" I was getting really frustrated and could feel tears welling up (hysterical from lack of sleep) so I just said ""We'll deal with this tomorrow, and it's getting moved back"" and then I went to sleep in *not* my room. I've woken up now and I'm so pissed off. Lana's at work so I can't talk to her but what should I do when she's home? I feel like this is going to turn into an argument, I don't think it'll be as simple as ""okay let's swap now you're home.""      ---      **tl;dr**: I went travelling for a month and told my roommate she could use my room for guests if needed. While I was gone she swapped all our stuff and moved into my much bigger and better bedroom. Never had a problem with her before but she doesn't seem like she's planning on swapping back. What do I do when I speak to her after work? EDIT: I've taken the advice of most people on this thread and moved my stuff back. It's taken hours and I'm knackered but I think if I left it another night it would be a real problem. I sent her a text when I was almost done (incase she kicked up a shitstorm and came home) to say ""Hi Lana! Hope you're having a nice day at work. Just to let you know I'm moving my stuff back into my room, didn't want you coming home and walking into the wrong one! :)"" (Yes I'm petty.) I'll be talking to her when she gets in because this is out of character for her, to the point of it being *bizarre*. She's never been anything but a model roommate, so I'm gonna give her a chance before we're donezo. If she wants to be reasonable and have a chat about rent portions I'm happy to do that. She's never had a problem with the rent before, and honestly I've never had uneven rent amounts in any place I've ever lived (whether I had a bigger room or smaller room) but a lot of people here are saying it's the norm so I'm open to talking about it if she's not ridiculous. EDIT 2: Lana should be home in a bit. I'll update when I can. **EDIT 3: Hi everyone, I've got about a million messages asking for an update but last night was a bit mad and I'm still pretty jetlagged so sorry but I went to sleep. Anyway, here we go.** **So as you know, I text Lana to tell her I moved my stuff back. She didn't reply to me, fine whatever, but she didn't kick off so I figured we were okay. I told my Aunt what had happened, who was as baffled as all of you, and I told her it was probably all sorted, just keeping her in the loop. I also told my boyfriend, who works about 5 mins down the road. He offered to come round, incase Lana's boyfriend came round, but I told him not to because then we're ganging up on *Lana*. He insisted on going for a ""coffee"" with his mate a couple roads away incase we needed backup. Which is a bit ridiculous but very cute of him.** **So I did get myself a glass of wine while waiting for Lana, not because I was nervous I just like wine, and she came home. I was sat in the living room and gave her a very cold ""hi"" when she walked in. She sort of froze, bag in hand, and her eyes darted between me and my/not her/our bedroom door. She blurted ""did you do it!?"" and I said ""what, move the rooms back? Yeah of course."" and her eyes went all wide and she dropped her bag and ran into the bathroom. I could hear her talking on the phone so I was like yipeeeee I guess Tom's coming round fuuuuuun!** **I  heard the door unlock and I was about to go full hulk on how psycho she is, when she came out of the door and stood between our bedrooms. Their doors are adjacent and she just stared between them both, breathing heavily? It was really odd. Then I noticed she was crying and getting a bit panicky, so I asked what was going on.** **She burst into tears and said ""Omg he's going to kill me"" and just sobbed so yeah it was the boyfriend's idea completely, as a lot of us suspected. She's honestly always been a perfect roommate, which is kind of why I came to this sub. If she was generally an arsehole, I would have known how to act, if you know what I mean? Anyway Lana has a bit of a breakdown, and it turns out POS Tom has always been a bit of a POS, very jealous (which I always saw hints of, but Lana never mentioned so I didn't), and has amped up his POSishness while I've been away. When I left he just finished school and basically moved in unannounced, and when she'd mention he hasn't been home in days, he'd give her the ""what, don't you love me, I treat you so well, you're so selfish, blah blah"" shit and refused to move. She showed me the texts he send her, absolutely horrific stuff, things like ""ring me in the next five minutes or we're over"" ""send me a picture of you at your desk with something showing todays date so I know you're at work"", just abusive stuff.** **ON TO THE ROOM: As we guessed, he moved it. He did it while she was at work, which is actually a bit gross thinking of him going through my stuff, and I'm considering somehow implying I have crabs or something he could catch just to make him squirm a bit, but I'll work on it. lana came home and said what are you doing, he made out it was just temporary and that I wouldn't mind (such a gentleman speaking on my behalf) and he would move it back, and he was doing ti for her and she was so selfish etc. When it got a few days before I came back, Lana suggested moving it back, and he completely denied he said that and told her it was her idea to move it and he only did what she told him but it's staying now or she'd be sorry.** **So basically Tom is a prick and Lana sobbed and apologised and cried and I fed her wine. She didn't want to see Tom (who obviously assumed he lived there now) so I text him from her phone saying our Landlady (my aunt) was coming round for an inspection and staying for dinner after with my family and he couldn't come over tonight. He sent a lot of begging, whiney texts, and then went on the offensive and called Lana a liar, so I rang my aunt, *explained everything* and had her write us a fake landlord email mentioning the visit and how she was looking forward to fajitas (because she's an absolute babe and I make good packet fajitas), which we forwarded on to Tom. He left her alone for the rest of the night, apart from a few texts.** **I'm not entirely sure what we do about Tom. Lana sounds like she wants to break up, judging from her crying and screaming"" I hate him, I hate him, I hate him"" into her wine. I think she's scared to though. I checked with her and he doesn't have a key, so that's a relief. I've told my aunt everything and she said she is happy to ban him from the flat, but Lana would need ot break up with him first and get all that sorted.** **Thanks everyone for the advice. I know it wasn't the most popcorny update, but hopefully Lana will be okay, and we're going to be doing some girly shit this week and avoiding Tom and yeah, god knows what will happen.**","She moved your things out when you weren't there. You're off work now, just swap things back straight away. Start with stripping the beds and changing the linen over. I wouldn't leave it till tomorrow, it normalises the situation. If she comes home whilst you're in the middle of it, just keep going or ask her to help you. Her bf should keep out of it. I assume he's lived there full-time over the last month, and he's seeing it as 'their' flat now. ",3353

I told her that I didn't want her to think I was implying anything, but that if it were me, I would want to know, and I thought she would want to know, too. She already knew. Not because they're in an open relationship, but because he had been having a three month texting ""affair"" with a girl last year. After that girl found out about Annie, she wrote Finnick a letter about how brokenhearted she was, then Finnick 'fessed up to Annie. Annie said she doesn't really considering it cheating, and that's fine, because it's her relationship and so she and Finnick get to determine the dealbreakers. I think she was a little concerned, though, because apparently he told her that he had deactivated/deleted his account, and that clearly didn't happen. She texted him when we were together and told him that someone else had found his profile. He apologized and swore that he didn't have the app downloaded but that he would go ahead and make sure his account is deactivated. I don't know how many people were really looking for an update, but I did get helpful advice on my last post and I really appreciated everyone's input.   ---      **tl;dr**: I am not a fan of Finnick. Wedding is still on. (minor edit: phrasing)","Well, you did the right thing, in my opinion. Going forward, I'd stay totally hands-off of anything regarding that portion of their relationship.

Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hc92o/my_26_m_family_disowned_me_now_want_to_reconnect/ I talked it over with my adoptive mother and my partner and I decided to see what my sister had to say. As a few people here suggested, I made a new email address and told her to only contact me there. I also told her I would only respond to her, that I wasn't ready to speak to my mother yet. I asked her why she was contacting me now, why she didn't stick up for me then, and what what she wanted from me.  She told me that when everything was happening my father had forbidden any of my siblings from talking to anyone about it or attending the trial. Everyone knew I was in therapy for being gay, but he told them that my ""legal troubles"" were because I had run away from therapy and I was selling myself and doing drugs and I refused to come home. None of that is true. I did have a drug problem later, but that's not what the trial was about and I never sold myself or ran away. I had to go to the hospital because I got hurt and the doctors there called the police. I also desperately wanted to come home but they didn't want me back.  Earlier this year my sister was playing a game with her son that she used to play with me when I was little and she realized there was nothing her son could do to make her stop loving him. She started asking my mother why they didn't find me and make me come home, get off drugs, etc. and my mother finally broke down and told her the truth. My sister immediately started looking for me but it took a while to track me down because I changed my name.  She says she doesn't want anything from me and I believe her. She said she's sorry for what happened to me and that she would have stepped in if she knew. We've been emailing back and forth a million times a day and we've Skyped. She still seems pretty conservative but she told me that she ""watches and enjoys Ellen"" and that my husband and I look sweet together in the photos she saw online. She still lives near the rest of my family, but she might come out here to visit. She wants to meet my partner and she sent a very nice e-card to my new mother to thank her for taking care of me. I'm really happy to have her back in my life.  I'm not sure what to think about my mother. My sister maintains that she really wants to see me and that she's so sorry and that my father made her do it, but she's still with him. And I'm even more hurt now that I know they lied about me. I put up with literal torture for them, and they threw me away and then told my family I was garbage so they would stop loving me too. She kept up the lie for ten years, and who knows how long she would have kept going if my sister hadn't been so persistent.    Anyways, thanks for all the advice I got here, especially from those of you who tried to be understanding about my mixed feelings towards my family.    ---      **tl;dr**: I decided to talk to my sister, my parents lied about what happened. ","I would move slowly and cautiously and establish a relationship with your sister first.  Then, perhaps, other siblings.

Originally, my weekend got a little more busy than I had planned, so I decided to move my coming out day until Tuesday.  So, on Sunday, I called my mom to set up dinner (if I hadn't, I knew I would back out and not tell them) and my mom was feeling impatient I guess, because she was just like ""let's talk about it now"" and put me on speaker phone with my dad right next to her.   So, I told them. And it went great. The first thing anyone said was when my dad immediately asked ""is that why you've been so damn weird the last three weeks?!"" Lol. Followed up immediately by a dad joke.  We are all going to talk to my little brother about it (probably today my sister, partner, and I are all still going for dinner.) And I asked my parents to pick out a new middle name for me (I've decided to stick with my given first name, it's androgynous). My dad's immediate response was ""Alwayswantedabeard Man Lastname"" So I decided to let my mom have the final say in my middle name lol.  I also set up an appointment to start hormone therapy in two weeks (and my insurance covers it!) So I'm pretty stoked about that.  I hope you guys all have a great week!  Tl;Dr parents give no fucks, I feel like I just had 600 pounds lifted from my shoulders, I'm starting testosterone in a couple weeks!  **Edit: to everyone PMing or leaving comments calling me a ""sick fuck"" or any other derogatory term, I hope you realize one day how hurtful and wrong you have been. Especially if you ever have kids that end up struggling the way I did.**  **And to those of you (the vast majority in this post) who have been supportive and excited for me, I appreciate every single one of you, as well as your comments. Thank you.** **Edit 2: my first gold ever, thanks guys. You've been overwhelmingly supportive. Thank you all. You're wonderful humans.**","I think it's very sweet and thoughtful of you to include them in the process by offering them the chance to give you your middle name. I *absolutely understand* that is not an option for most people who are transitioning, but you seem to have a good relationship with your parents and you suggested it yourself, so I think it's really cool. You get to keep your autonomy and do what makes you thrive, but also let them know that they're an important part of your life and identity. Or at least that's what I get from it. Congratulations! :)",1351
6sl3p6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6pm1qj/my_husband_m42_and_i_m32_together_6_years_fought/ I want to thank all of you for your comments and support; they made me realize really how shitty of a relationship I was in.  I did return home from my business trip, and after another physical incident, I said that was enough.  I called my parents (who are awesome), and my dad (who is awesome) came and helped me to safely get out.  We were even able to get my car out (its in only my name, and the lease is held by a major bank).  Funny thing was, that my dad had remarked to me that he and my mom had been waiting for that call from me for six years now.  In hindsight I should have gotten out *way* sooner, but hindsight is a bitch. During this process, the tribal courts and tribal police were way more helpful than I had expected.  A distant cousin of my spouse in the court actually helped us by writing a letter which would have compelled access to my car (and how to work the system), even though civil matters weren't his area and the obvious relationship.  (We didn't end up officially using the letter since we couldn't get is signed by a judge in time). The police were very understanding, and felt my request was extremely reasonable, and they did everything they could do to make sure the retrieval went smoothly. So after an over-night stay in a major PNW city, getting the car to a transport service, and a cross-country flight, I am safely with my parents now.  It's not the house I grew up in, but it still feels like home.  And by the way, my boss and his boss are fantastic.  They have been nothing but understandable and willing to work with me so far, and that is absolutely fantastic. So now I begin the process of rebuilding.  I'm going to focus on me, and do things I want to do which I know I wil enjoy.  I *will* rebuild myself financially and emotionally (my spouse subtly and not so subtly siphoned off resources by not having much free cash of his own, since he kept buying shit), and I will rebuild relationships which have frayed either due to alienation or distance.  Friends I have already talked to have been nothing but supportive, and I have warned them my spouse might try to manipulate them to get to me. What about my spouse you may be wondering?  Well, as soon as he realized that I had left his parents' house, turned off a family locator app, and was not answering his calls, he tried to guilt his way back to me.  He supposedly had a nervous breakdown, and was admitted to a local hospital off reservation.  When I landed last night there were messages from him that he had moved to the psych ward at a larger regional hospital, that he was going to try and get money back to me that I had given him for closing costs on the home purchase, and that he was sorry.  While if that is really the case, I'm sorry it happened that way, but I have the closure I need, and from now on I need to focus on myself. --- **TL;DR**: I got out of my (financially, emotionally, physically) abusive relationship Monday, and I am not looking back, since I have amazing people in my life and things can only get better from here.","I am so glad you got out! I hope anyone who is currently in an abusive relationship especially reads this: >Funny thing was, that my dad had remarked to me that he and my mom had been waiting for that call from me for six years now. In hindsight I should have gotten out way sooner, but hindsight is a bitch. Many people think they have nowhere to go, that no one cares, that their friends and family either accept the situation or have given up, and will just pile on with ""I told you so"" and not be sympathetic.  That those they've cut ties with in whole or in part won't care. In fact, everyone who really cares about you will be relieved and happy you've escaped.

6v2xd3,"[Original post]  (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6tntf0/my_m42_gf_f36_of_2_years_she_says_she_likes_to_be/)  When I made my original post, I was feeling at an impasse and thinking I was going to end a relationship I valued, only because our sex life was starting to slacken.  Initial responses were confirming this fear ""oh you have a dead bedroom... bail on that""  Then I got a few comments about our poor communication, which I kindof knew... but also about how my perception of what my GF was saying she wanted (being taken) was in fact me being stubborn about what I thought it would make me to fulfill that role for her.    I think, being my age, I get prone to thinking I know a lot.. but in some aspects, I'm as stupid/innocent about things as it can get.    Prior to the post, I was pretty strict about ""anytime someone utters no, that is full stop"".  I haven't changed the spirit of this - but the comments also lead me to understand that sometimes knowing that you drive a person so crazy they just can't keep their paws off you, lead me to realize I do in fact feel that way about my GF - and that I was intentionally suppressing something that she likely really wanted to feel.  Since the post, the next time we went out, I intentionally was oogling her and telling her ways I was attracted to how she was behaving, looking.  I also took a quick second to tell her that I've been thinking about our bedroom issues and that I decided upon a safe word that she could use later if needed... I told her the word, then went back to smirking at her as I looked her up and down and... she was just radiant about it.  She lit up with smiles and I literally could just tell I had said exactly the right thing to her.    I'm a ""physical touch"" person and I just notice when she gives more than not - but her contact frequency with me has been outstanding since then (it had dwindled).  Our bedroom situation has shifted to zero complaints for me as well - but our general connection just seems to be a complete reverse from where I felt it was.  I don't think my original post gained much attention, but I wanted to post an update to thank those who took the time to respond and help me out.  This literally took the best possible direction for me - better than I had hoped for in fact.  It wouldn't have been possible without those who took time to respond.  As for me, I already knew there are things I'm ignorant about, but it was another good lesson to realize I can be a stubborn asshole and become too entrenched without realizing it.  The next time I feel like I'm facing an impossible issue with someone I care about, that is going to be one of the first things I take a serious look at.  As people had pointed out, she was telling me what she wanted (if not 100% direct, she was communicating it).  I also think she wasn't listening to me either - but there was enough there to align us back together to where now I'm very happy with us again.      ---      **tl;dr**: Just an update on where reddit helped uncover some of the issues I was dealing with and now I'm rounding out to a week of ""back to great"" with my GF - thanks Reddit!!!","Good for you!

75qugw,"Hi Reddit. A little while back I wrote here for advice. [Here is my initial post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/73kzs8/me_33f_and_my_husband_34m_together_for_10_years/). I didn’t expect it to be nearly as big as I thought it would be. I went into it trying to reply to everyone, because I expected a handful of comments. I tried replying to as many of you as possible but I did miss some, I’m sorry! Besides a particular comment that accused me of sexually assaulting my husband (which has since been deleted) most of you guys really had helpful responses and anecdotes. I really appreciate that everyone took time out of their day to read through my post and give me advice. On to the update. This feels a little messy, because I'm having trouble organizing my thoughts, and I apologise. But this update did not go as I expected. A commenter said that it sounded as if my husband directing his emotions about unrelated issues onto me. I replied to be polite, but honestly kind of put it out of my mind. My husband has never really done anything of the sort, and I had no reason to suspect he would do that now. Well, turns out that commenter is clairvoyant. It turns out my husband’s mother has been diagnosed with a medical issue and does not have very long to live. She was initially in the hospital about 2 weeks before my post, which I knew. What I didn’t know is that the doctors found some things that gave her a very short life expectancy; they weren’t sure what the problem was, but they knew what the problem would lead to. I, and my husband's siblings, were told it wasn't a big deal. My MIL didn’t want any of her kids to know until she was diagnosed properly with the real source of her issues. My FIL went against her wishes and told my husband, who convinced my FIL not to tell any of his other children. He also didn’t tell me, out of respect for his mother’s wishes, until a couple of days after my post.  So obviously my husband had been going through a *lot* of emotional things, that he didn’t share with me out of respect for his dying mother. He felt he couldn’t disrespect her wishes after his father already did, so his worry and his inability to lean on me for support culminated in him struggling emotionally, which led to our minor argument. We have been discussing that our communication suffered  – and that it led to the conversation about which I asked for advice. That really hurt, and isn’t a good habit to have in a relationship. My husband had never done anything like this before, and he was quick to own up to responsibility about this. We’ve mostly been dealing with my MIL and trying to make her comfortable and happy, but we have spoken a little about what my post was about. As I said in my post, usually my touching wasn’t ‘too much’ for him at all. But if my touching is just too much right now because of everything else going on, that still needs to be addressed. My husband admitted that he usually loved it, but right now it felt like he was being overloaded with *stuff* and my touching contributed to that. He also admitted that he didn’t communicate that properly. We agreed that my husband would practice being more upfront and immediate about any discomfort I might bring if I helped him along by more regularly asking boundary questions when I *do* touch him, which I will of course be reigning in until he communicates that that can change. We ended up agreeing that diversifying the way we show love would never be a bad thing. I showed him my post and we want to look through the love language stuff and communicate better about everything that I, and your advice, brought up in the post. But right now, we’re focusing on his mother, so we haven’t gone into it as deep as we’d like.  So… a lot of what was in my post *is* a problem, but not as big of a problem as my husband initially made it seem like, and potentially it might be temporary (or it might not be). I’m just happy my husband and I are communicating again, so we can tackle everything as a team. We will still be looking through all of your great advice, but right now it’s just not a priority. Thank you guys again. It’s only one update per post, so I won’t be able to update further along in the future when we’re more actively putting all your advice into practice, but I hope this update suffices. **Tl;dr:** My husband was going through issues that led to our communication suffering. We’re dealing with that now, and it’s going pretty well. ",Sorry to hear about your MIL. What a shitty time. Glad the other was more temporary though. Communication wins again!,63

All of your comments were really appreciated and definitely helped me think.  So for the last week my ex has been staying with family when hes not at work and we have been sharing time with Sarah. We met up this weekend to talk about everything and our life plan. He basically said that he does still love me, but that his schedule is just not something that can change for him anytime soon. I am trying to be understanding and supportive, because I do want to be with him and Sarah. We are going to look into counseling for us as a couple, and also family counseling for the three of us. I did bring up legal adoption of Sarah. I was shocked when he said he was thinking of the same thing. He said that no matter what happens with us as a couple he always wants me to be a parental figure to Sarah. We had both hoped that someday I would adopt her, we just didn't see us breaking up or it becoming an issue. I am so glad we are on the same page about that. I am over the moon and were going to meet with a lawyer on Friday to get the ball rolling on that.   I am hoping that this relationship can be saved because I really do feel like I have a family with them. My number one priority throughout this has been Sarah, and I am cant even explain how happy I am that I will get to legally be her parent. I know I wont ever be her mother but I'm glad that we will be together no matter what. Thanks Reddit! Sorry this is kind of all over the place. We're still figuring everything out, but I wanted to update! tl;dr: We are going to start couples and family counseling, as well as beginning the process for legal adoption!  Edit: Thank you so much for all your comments. This got bigger than I expected. Thanks for all the kind words. To people think that I am being taken advantage of for free child care please realize that I've happily cared for Sarah for the last 5 years and have no problem continuing to do so. To whoever gilded me for this thank you so much! ",This is a good update. I really hope everything works out for the both of you. I'm so happy you talked about adopting Sarah and he agreed!

I had last spoke to him on Wednesday, where I told him unless he could let go of the past and stop bringing things up, then this relationship was over. I was done being the emotional punching bag. I ended up breaking up with him on Saturday. I wasn't sure what I was going to do, but there were a couple of things that really sealed the deal for me. When he came in the house, I hadn't even brushed my teeth yet so I went to go do that. As I'm brushing my teeth, he immediately stated that I was brushing my teeth wrong, and, ""When are you ever going to listen to me about how to brush your teeth?"" Then, when we went to my room, he asked how much I had cried since Wednesday. When he said this, he looked happy. Like it made him happy that I was so upset about this whole thing, like he took it as flattery.  It was at that moment I knew it had to be over. I love him so much, and am pretty miserable, however I know I needed to do it. I keep thinking that if I were in his shoes, and the relationship was so rocky, I wouldn't be criticizing him on how he brushes his damn teeth.  When I was breaking up with him, he kept saying this was the wake up call, and he was going to change. That I was giving up on him, and at least he can say he tried and I can't say that. He was relentless, but I stuck to my guns. Before he left, he told me he really hoped I would see a therapist, because I needed help.   It should also be noted that I am the same user who wrote a relationships advice post about having a boyfriend who wanted me to change my hair color. I'm pretty sure I deleted the post, so I cannot link it, but I honestly should have listened to you all then and not gotten so invested in someone who constantly felt the need to want to change me through controlling comments.  EDIT: OH MY GOD! You guys are so awesome. I have been so upset, but reading these posts have further let me know I did the right thing. The hardest part is that there were great times, and even reading my posts I worry that I was too hard on him and painted him too negatively, but I'm seeing now that this is just me making excuses. I feel terribly guilty about how sad he must be, but I know this will soon fade. You are all absolutely amazing and kind. Just to clarify, I was the girl whose boyfriend wanted her to stop bleaching her hair blonde because he couldn't date me unless he saw me ""natural"".       ---      **tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I broke up, absolutely heartbroken but know it had to be done.

She didn't want to go through the gate, because she'd never visited the grave. Even when the funeral was held, she didn't want to go because she didn't want it to be real. I waited for her for about thirty minutes, then decided to go on without her so I could at least see Diana's grave. After another thirty minutes, my mom came and joined me. She started sobbing that it wasn't real, that it was all a bad dream. I just sat there and let her cry. I'd watched Diana die- I knew it was real. So, I just let her try and understand what I knew all along. It made me feel like a robot. I felt even worse when I looked at her headstone, and just felt nothing. Obviously, I miss and love my sister, but I just didn't feel *sad*. It just felt like looking at a stranger's headstone, and thinking, ""Hey, we have the same last name."" My mom eventually wore herself out, and just hugged the headstone and sat there, sniffling. I got up and started to look around, checking out the other gravestones. I have no idea what happened, but I was staring at a headstone, and doing some mental math to find out how old the person was. They were thirty. All of a sudden, I just started bawling. I was thinking about how excited my sister was to turn thirty, and I realized she would never get to turn thirty. I sat in front of a total stranger's headstone, and cried like a baby. Eventually, I managed to get back to my mom, and we held each other for a while and cried together. She told me she loved me, and I told her I loved her. We just stood there for a long time, then my mom told me she wanted me to have ""my moment"" with my sister, and went off to a different part of the cemetery. I sat with the headstone for a while, and just started talking about my life. I talked about my job, my lack of success on Tinder, how badly I wanted a cat but my apartment complex didn't let us have animals. I kept waiting for her to tease me, or tell me I was being ridiculous, but she didn't say anything, and I just broke down in tears every time I finished a sentence. I went to find my mom after sitting there for about forty-five minutes. We went to go get breakfast at a nearby diner. I asked my mom what she was doing since Diana died. She said she'd been going to her counselor, but also found a local group of grieving parents who do a group therapy thing. I asked if she had hobbies outside of Diana. She said that she did what she did before Diana died, and I asked her to do something like scrapbooking, or cooking, or just take a class. I even offered to pay, and that snapped my mom out of it pretty quickly- she swatted at me and told me not to pay for her. Once she got home, she signed up for a meditation class, and at my request- also started taking an art class at her local rec center. I like to think she's doing a bit better. The other day, she sent me a picture of me and Diana from the day she moved out. It was really sweet, and I asked her to send me a physical copy so I could frame it. I think I'm also doing better. I visited Diana last night, and I felt really good. I brought her some flowers, and I just stayed and chatted for a little bit. I got myself into a grief handling program, and I'm excited to attend my first group therapy session. This festered in me for a long time, and I let myself believe I was okay because we didn't have a ""real bond."" But we did, and I loved her, and I've been trying to heal in a way that was just... Going through the motions. I had to let my world stop turning for a while, and experience it like my mother did. Before that visit to the cemetery, I would cook for myself every night. Since then, I've been going through frozen meals like crazy. I would shower everyday, make sure I curled my hair every morning, wore matching socks even if my boots were too high for anyone to see. Now, I let my hair get kind of gross and let it stay straight for a while. I drag whatever socks I can get out of my dryer. I let myself be sad, and gross, and ugly, and unfortunate. I eat lunch by myself at work somedays, and hide in the bathroom when I feel grief coming on. I've ripped the band-aid off, and am letting all the bacteria and ick get into the cut before I pour hydrogen peroxide in it and let it really be fixed.  It's bedtime for me now, but thank you to everyone who reached out and commented and was kind. And to the people who weren't, thanks for still taking time out of your day. TLDR: My mom and I had a catharsis moment at my sister's grave, and have been slowly healing and rebuilding ourselves. We're doing okay, and are slowly getting back to being happy and normal.","Hi, I know I'm not going through exactly what you're going through, but last month, I lost my boyfriend suddenly. He was 25. All throughout the next few days, through the private visitation, the dinners with his family, the funeral, etc. I was weirdly stoic. I mean, I definitely cried, but it wasn't all the time. At his funeral I barely cried at all. Looking at his body didn't even feel real - it felt like it was a weird wax dummy of him or something. I kept waiting for him to pop out of somewhere and start making jokes about the whole situation (as was his nature). As his girlfriend and probably the closest person to him at the time of his death, I almost felt like I was playing ""hostess"", having to greet everybody and saying ""thank you for being here, it means so much to myself and his family"" over and over again. Now, it's been a little over a month since he passed. And I mean, I bawl. Like a lot. All the time. I cried while I was making pancakes this morning and my eyes got so blurry I couldn't see to flip them properly in the pan lol. And the littlest, innocuous things ""trigger"" me - a photo, a sunset, a glass of water, Poptarts, you name it lol. I look at his Facebook and all of his photos and read all of the messages on his wall every day. I also look at all the phones and videos on my phone every day. I changed my lockscreen and background to two different photos of him. And I write my diary entries as letters addressed to him. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I really know what you're going through. After the initial shock wears off, it's like you didn't even know your body had the capacity for this much sadness, or the ability to cry so freaking much. But it's ok.  Everybody always looks kind of freaked out or upset when they see me crying about what happened. But honestly, in this weird cathartic way, it feels so good. It feels so good to just think about him and let it all out. And a lot of times I end up feeling just so fortunate to have ever known him, and so grateful for life in general, as strange as that sounds. I'm almost *grateful* to cry because that means that I loved him so much that my body really feels and expresses it. Anyway...I don't know if this will help you at all but I had to share my story. I really relate to you and I hope that dealing with this gets easier with the passage of time. Good luck to you <3 Edit: I just want to thank everyone for your kind responses, it’s been amazing and I never expected this comment to blow up so much. Thank you whoever gave me gold! And thank you all for leaving your condolences and sharing your stories with me. I hope we can all heal together ❤️",1435

Against my better judgement, I decided to give him another chance.  Anyway, I'll get to the incident which was the straw which broke the camel's back.  Last Sunday, I enquired whether we could spend the coming Friday night together so we could get an early start to the weekend. He replied that he would let me know how his schedule worked with that. The following day (Monday), I received a dinner invite for Friday from a bunch of good friends. Since X hadn't confirmed with me on his schedule yet, I assumed things were still up in the air with him so I accepted the invitation.  I informed X that I would be doing dinner with my friends, so I would be meeting him a couple of hours later than I had initially suggested. He FLIPPED OUT on me.  He yelled and screamed at me on the phone, cursing me out and demanding to know who was so fucking important I was going to meet. He asked me if a frivolous dinner with mere friends meant more to me than spending time with my SO.  I responded that of course I valued my SO's, however there were other people I also liked to have in my life. He told me I could go and date those people then. He went on at how I was incredibly disrespectful towards his time and that I was jerking him around. I told him that I didn't see how that counted as being disrespectful of his time since it was only Monday and the invite was for Friday - I was keeping him updated of the dinner way in advance so that he could plan his time for those couple of hours ; it wasn't as though I was pushing plans back at the very last minute or even cancelling on him.  I told him that in my perspective, since he had yet to get back to me on his schedule I had the impression that we weren't confirmed hence accepted the invite.  I also told him that from my point of view, when I make plans with someone for the whole weekend and they push things back a couple of hours (for whatever reason) it wouldn't be a big deal to me so I didn't see why he was being so drastic.  He then said to enjoy myself with my friends and that he hoped the dinner would be worth the cost of our relationship. I responded 'ok'.  There's still some stuff that both of us have at each other's places though so we're meeting up later this week to return things.  Tl;dr - he made things easy by breaking up with me. ","Oh man, this sounds exactly like my ex bf and same age too. I wouldn't be surprised if he tries to manipulate you when you go to exchange things and starts saying he doesn't want to break up, but that he was just hurt by your actions. Run far away!",2717
7j6hws,"This is a really strange situation. I hung out with a guy I sort of know at a bar for a while, and he asked to see my gaming PC so we went over my apartment. Jokingly, his friends were saying we were going up there to fuck (I live above the bar). We did a tiny bit of coke while we were up there, hung out and played games and talked about the PC for like maybe an hour and a half or so, then he went back down and I stayed up there.  While he was down there, I dont know what got into him, but he must have told his friends some story that ended with us having sex. Or its possible one of his friends just thought that? I have no idea, he was really coked up when he left downstairs so I assume it was him who told the story.  the next day I awoke to a whole lot of people messaging me saying that they heard me and george (the guy) had sex and that they had no idea I was gay and they wanted to congratulate me and all that. I am not sure HOW this spread so fast, but 4 people hit me up. Apparently the rumor developed into not only did I have sex with him, but I also came out to him as gay?  Either way, I wrote a FB status right there and then seeking to end this tirade, saying it didnt happen, me and george didnt do anything, its just some weird lie or rumor. A person (a gay man specifically) wrote that he didnt think george would lie about that and that he is disappointed that I felt so embarrassed to come out as gay that I would deny it after, or to accuse a gay man of lying just to protect my masculinity. that comment got 6 likes, and a few people responded saying they agree, that it came off like I was denying it to protect my masculinity, and that they believe george over me. Another girl wrote as her status ""when straight guys call a gay man a liar about them having sex just to protect his masculinity"" and it was kind of obvious she was referring to me.  I dont even know what to say. For one, I hit up george, I called him, its been 4 days, zero response. I am not even sure if I have the right phone number. I am not even sure if its HIM spreading this rumor at all, it could have just been someone who saw him go up to my apartment. I've gotten a few more messages from people congratulating me for coming out, and that ""they had no idea!"" and stuff like that. I've told every single one, sorry, its just a rumor, some of them were like 'oh okay sorry'  and some didnt even respond, presumably because they saw my status and that guy who commented on it.  I don't know what to do. I dont give a shit if I was gay, but I don't want to be known as gay when I am not. Its just a weird feeling because people have accused me now of homophobia over this and I just feel terrible because I have no bad feelings towards gay people, but I just want people to know, I am not gay. Like, this isn't true, at all. But now everytime I deny it it just looks worse. One of my friends hit me up and she said ""look, I know you are denying it, but on the chance you are gay and just feel embarrassed thats okay too!"" and it just made me realize I may never be able to shake this off What the hell do I do? I barely even know this george guy, he might never respond!  Edit: In the title I said 'refuses to tell the truth', really its more like he isnt responding at all       ---      **tl;dr**: Being accused of sleeping with a dude, I am not gay. Its spreading all over facebook. ","Honestly, on those statuses, I would say something like ""please stop erasing my sexuality - while I understand there is a stigma against being gay, it's incredibly insensitive to erase my own sexuality because of your preconceived notions. When I say I am *not* gay - you should respect that as much as a gay man when he says he *is* gay. You do not get to say these things to me.""    EDIT: if you really want to stick it too them, you could say ""and furthermore, in the future, if you think someone has been outed as gay and it was obviously not their decision and they are appearing to deny it, maybe you shouldn't insult them. If I actually had been gay and decided to deny it, that would have been my choice, regardless of what you think of gay people who do that. I'm kind of surprised at the insensitivity people have been expressing to me when they think that I am hiding my sexuality - perhaps you are more a part of the problem for people in the LGBTQ community than you realize.    As a sidenote - everyone should know I am a safe person to reveal these things to. And while I am not gay, I have no problems with anyone based on their sexuality. That's the end of my discussion on this.""    EDIT 2: I like what someone said about sexism being at play too - taking away sexual agency from you is demeaning, you can work that one in as well. Like ""By the way, on top of all of this - when you perpetuate this sexual rumor that I have clearly told you is not true, you are taking away my sexual agency. This is no different than some dude at a party lying that he banged some young woman upstairs. Me telling you that it's not true should be enough for you, and when you refuse to believe me, it's insulting to me and everyone else that is at the recieving end of lies like this.""    Your ""friends"" are all pretty rude.    EDIT 3: you are free to use all of that verbatim if you feel like it.",3278
7jfdqt,"[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7iwjca/my_23m_girlfriend_21f_of_1_year_is_going_through/) My girlfriend and I were sitting on the couch together. Randomly, she said “I love you”, and explained how grateful she was to be with me. She told me I was making it a lot easier to grieve her brother’s death, and she wouldn’t know what to do without me. She said I was the best boyfriend she could ever wish for and my company alone was helping her tremendously. I couldn’t believe my girlfriend. She'd witnessed her brother die, was still grieving his death and yet could still find the strength in herself to make my day a little better. I turned soft -- I felt something inside of me… something I’d never felt before. My eyes started to water. I couldn’t believe it. I was going to cry. My girlfriend saw this, and she couldn't believe it either. That was my trigger. I started bawling. For the first time in my life, I cried. I was embarrassed. She started crying too, we embraced each other. I cried with her until my tears ran dry. I told her how much I missed my brother. I told my girlfriend how afraid I was of losing her because of my lack of empathy. I told her how unfair it was for me to put my emotional distress on her.  My girlfriend was very receptive. She said it was okay for me to be emotional around her. She said helping me find my lost emotions was the most meaningful thing for her in the world. My understanding of life has changed for the better ever since that day. I feel like a *real* human being. I’m able to understand what my girlfriend is going through. It took me 8 months, but I’ve finally started mourning the death of my brother.  My girlfriend has been a lot happier these last few days. She says it’s a direct result of me finding my emotions. This couldn’t have been possible without her. I'm so grateful to have her be a part of my life. My love and undying gratitude for her can't be translated into words. She's the only woman that gave me a chance after hearing about my “condition”, and the only one to help me with it. I couldn't ask for more from my girlfriend. I love her.  --- **tl;dr:** My girlfriend and I were sitting on the couch together. She said she loved me and gave me compliments for being a great boyfriend. My eyes watered and I cried for the first time in my life. I told my girlfriend how afraid I was of losing her. I told her how much I missed my brother. I told her how unfair it was for me to be putting my emotions on her when she's in a time of need. My girlfriend reassured me. She said helping me find my emotions was the most meaningful thing in the world for her.  My understanding of life has changed since then. I feel like a real person now. Someone who can express the full range of emotions that a normal human should be able to. This all happened because of my girlfriend, I love her so much. I can empathize with what she's going through now, and fully support her in her time of need.","this is wonderful, OP. i'm so sorry for the loss of your brother, but it sounds like you have a wonderful partner in life to help you through it.

7k4hpj,"I got a lot of really great feedback from the original post about 3 weeks ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fka81/how_do_i_26f_stop_feeling_bitter_about_my/) and guess I just wanted to say thanks.  It took a few days to digest what a lot of people were saying.  At the end of the day I hoped to approach the situation as me wanting to be close to my family again and basically trying to ignore the money part.  For the next couple of weeks if I wanted to talk to my mother I made sure to call at a time I knew she wasn't swamped with work (either before she left for the day or before going to bed) and if anything to do with money came up, it was treated as a side note. ""Oh dad won 4k last night online? That's awesome for him. Where are you travelling for work tomorrow? Have you been there before? Are you looking forward to it?"" and she just sort of.. opened up. I told her how I was feeling slighted, fully addressed the issue and even told her how I felt the slight favoritism towards my brother, because he was present, was getting to me.  My mother is an extremely intelligent woman, reading back on my posts I think I stressed this a lot but she really, really is. We had our one super feelsy chat and moved on but she's been going out of her way to show me she's serious this time with actions not just words. I was over recently and before she dropped me off at home (we live about an hour away from one another) she stopped to at a store and remarked ""your dad and brother lost 600$ last night online, what kind of fucked up logic is it that I can't afford to buy you some groceries?"" . Our upcoming Christmas plans, which I was dreading, are now actual plans. She's picked out a theme for before and after dinner, neither which involve gambling, and is incredibly focused on us spending time away from a computer screen. Our gift exchange is a 20$ limit and she found some game online so that nothing is tailored towards anyone and we all feel included. She's been providing ideas for the wedding planning and even called me the other day saying ""Well you call me all the time and I was thinking about you so I thought I'd call you!"" just to chat. Overall... Im kind of stoked about where this is going. It's only been less then a month but I've never known my mother to commit to something and not stick with it so, I'm remaining hopeful. Thanks for all the insight, personal experiences and words of advice for coping. I read every single one of those comments over and over for weeks so I figured some kind of update was warranted. TL;DR: Talked to mom again. Used a lot of points from my previous post and communication saves the day once again. ",Seems like the gambling addiction-sized elephant in the room remains...,543
7kgmom,"[Original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ioujo/my_21m_girlfriend_27f_of_almost_3_years_proposed/) I wrote a letter to Sarah. I told her I was sorry for not being empathetic to what she was going through. I told her I didn’t understand how much the proposal meant to her. I apologized if what I said misled her into thinking it was okay for her to propose to me. I listed my timeline. I said I'd like to be engaged around the time I graduated university and I wanted to get married the same year. I mentioned I was open to having children with her. I gave Sarah the letter when she came home from work. She read it and we had a discussion about everything over dinner.   My girlfriend apologized for mistaking my words as a green light for her to propose. She expressed regret for withdrawing physical intimacy and distancing herself from me for 3 weeks.  Sarah explained to me how she never wanted kids or marriage at the beginning of our relationship, but seeing all her friends get married made her question that. My girlfriend realized she wasn't content anymore on staying child free and not getting married for the rest of her life.  My girlfriend told me my timeline was acceptable for her. Sarah asked if I could be the one to propose to her this time - I told her I would. I’ve never seen my girlfriend so giddy with excitement before. I’m glad we could come to a happy solution. I’m excited to spend the rest of my life with this woman. I love her with all my heart and I couldn’t see myself being with a different person. I know I’m young to get married, but I’m absolutely ecstatic to start a family with my girlfriend.  Our relationship is back to normal, we have sex everyday and she’s comfortable initiating with me again. She doesn’t cry in secret anymore and we’re back to our regular levels of physical intimacy.  I deeply regret rejecting her proposal because in reality this is what I wanted the whole time. I just needed a few days to seriously think about it. I'm glad my girlfriend has forgiven me for this. I know both of us are equally at fault because of our lack of communication but it really did suck having to reject her.  --- **tl;dr:** I wrote a letter to my girlfriend explaining to her when I’d like to get married and that I was open to having children with her. Her and I apologized to each other for not communicating clearly enough. We agreed on my timeline and I’m going to propose to her next year when I graduate! ",You handled this really well!

7ncait,"We talked the day after I made the [original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mjb8x/my_19f_best_friend_since_childhood_18f_told_me/) The advice I received helped me a lot on how to handle this, many thanks to y’all.  I told her that I still saw her as my best friend, no matter what her sexuality was. I said I loved her, but only as a sister. I apologized for misleading her into thinking I had romantic feelings for her. My friend thanked me for being supportive of her coming out of the closet. She said I was the first one she told about her sexuality. I told her I was honoured that she came out to me first, and that it really meant a lot for our friendship. She told me the things we did together didn’t cause her to think that I had feelings for her, and that really close girl friends do stuff like that with each other all the time. Hearing her say that relieved a lot of guilt from me. My friend was okay with me not liking her in the same way, and that she expected it. She explained to me that our friendship was one of a kind, and that she wouldn’t let anything get in the way of that. I told her if she needed time away from me that I'd be completely fine with it, but she said she was okay and that she’d already dealt with her feelings for me before telling me. Our friendship has not changed. She’s still the same person that I’ve known since grade 2. I don’t feel at all awkward being around her knowing that she’s a lesbian. She said coming out to me made her feel a sense of freedom, she told me it was hard to keep such a big lie from me when we tell each other everything. We’ve been through so much together. This is another bump in our journey that we’ll overcome. In the end, I feel like her coming out to me has brought us closer together. I’ll always be her best friend no matter what, and I’ll be fully supporting her when she starts telling everyone about her sexuality.   ---      **tl;dr**: We talked about it. I said I didn’t like her romantically but that I still saw her as my sister and best friend. She thanked me for being supportive of her and told me she wanted to keep our friendship the same. Our friendship has not changed in anyway. She’s still the same kind and caring person I grew up with and have always known to be my best friend. ",I love happy endings.

7z936w,"Here is the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7yn3jg/my_28m_husband_31m_of_6_years_takes_ridiculous/ So that post totally blew up. I posted it at like 7:30 Monday morning while the family was getting ready, got zero responses and went out skiing, by lunch time it had like 200 responses and by the time I got in that evening it was over 500. By far my biggest reddit post ever (mostly DIY and crafts stuff). I spent Monday night carefully reading every single response because there was a ton of value in all of them.  One post stood out and I apologize to whoever made it that I can't mention it them by name, but essentially they said it appeared I was conflating two issues, my husband taking risks and him not being social on vacation. I guess in the interest of brevity I had left out some details, I found out about Gregory's back country skiing because he is essentially my dad's hero and my dad sat there like a star struck school girl while Gregory regaled him with tales of backcountry skiing with local teenagers and jumping off 20 foot cliffs into powder. I was deeply annoyed with Gregory because it was the first time he was social with anyone. We were on day 3 of the vacation and he had literally gone to bed at 8 every night to get up and ski. I was jealous of how much fun my brother's wife and my two cousin's spouses were so engaged with the family. So I conflated my annoyance with both him (and my dad frankly) for being anti-social and taking risks. The posts the other day really helped me realize that and I made it a point to be nicer to him.  It also helped that Monday night my cousin's husband got rip roaring drunk in our condo and started cursing up blue streak. This with kids aged 1-10 all staying in the same relatively small space. He and my cousin had a extremely embarrassing and public fight that started inside and ended outside within earshot of the entire base area ""village."" It made me realize that no matter how annoyed I can get with Gregory and his desire to not be social on most occasions, he will never, ever put me through that which helped me gain some perspective.  The yesterday afternoon as my cousin and her husband were getting ready to leave, he was acting like a jack ass while driving (he was probably wickedly hung over) in the parking lot and ended up sliding right into a snow bank, giving their new Lexus some significant body damage. He got out cursing and spewing in the parking lot all while basically standing like a helpless baby screaming at my cousin that she needed to ""call someone goddamnit."" Gregory and my Dad very calmly dug his car out of the snow, dug up some gravel for traction and then backed his car out. It took maybe 10 minutes. It made me realize that quite possibly, all of Gregory's experience in remote places while biking, skiing, bowhunting, etc... have taught him to be relaxed and knowledgeable in a high pressure situation and he just did what had to be done. I felt very lucky and felt very sorry for cousin. I was watching this very hungover, overweight man cry in the middle of a parking lot because ""that's a $6500 grill on that car!"" while my very attractive and in shape husband who doesn't drink was calmly digging the entire car out.  Yesterday, morning I asked him if he would be willing to ski with me that day and he said absolutely, that he was hoping we would get at least one day together. So another strike on me for not communicating with him and assuming that he would see me as something of a ""burden"" to his ski day so I didn't even want to ask if he'd ski with me. We actually had a great time together and he's so experienced he actually taught me more than I probably ever would have gotten from a paid lesson.  While we were on the chairlift that day, I very calmly brought up my concerns about the back country skiing, leaving me to watch the kids (on other vacations, as I've said my mom and aunt are on ""kid duty' this trip--though me and my brother's wife are watching the kids today while my mom and aunt ski) while he goes and does activities. He assured me that the back country skiing at this area was very safe but that in the future he would get all the equipment necessary (float coat, peeps) in order to reduce the risk and he said that he was sorry for leaving me to go surfing on our last trip and that he would try very hard to communicate before hand what his desires for any particular trip will be in advance and have it be a dialectic conversation with give and take vs him just assuming he can bolt off whenever the waves are big. I also said I was sorry for being so cold to him since the trip started but that I would appreciate him trying to hang out for a little longer each night. He said that it's thinly veiled secret that he can't stand my cousin's husband because he is constantly trying to ""one upping"" and ""talking down"" to Gregory for a myriad of reasons (they work in a similar field, so I guess there's something of a rivalry) and now that he's gone he will be more comfortable. So last night Gregory cooked steaks for everyone and stayed up a little later (8:30 is later right?) and chatted and seemed to have a good time. So today, since this was a planned day off for me to watch the kids, we agreed that he could meet his new friends really early so they could do some in area hiking before the lifts started and that he could stay out as late as he wanted if the snow was good.  So basically all is good, I love my husband more than words can possibly say and I'm glad we had this time together because I think while we had relatively minor problems in the grand scheme of things, we are coming out healthier and happier for it.  If I hadn't made my post Monday morning, I very well have made the rest of the vacation miserable for both of us. Thank you very much for all the all the help!       ---      **tl;dr**: follow up to my post from Monday about me being angry at my husband for taking extreme risks while doing his sports. But was probably more about me being annoyed with him not being social and me not communicating with him. ","It's really nice to see such a positive update, I'm happy for you OP.  I know what it's like to hide out from horrible family members, too, so I get it.  Keep talking to one another!

7zom8g,"[link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7wewwb/a_colleague_30ish_m_that_i_28f_dislike_keeps/) I wanted to post a quick update because a lot of people here seemed  as annoyed with this caveman as I am.  I got a ton of great advice (thank-you!), and I started practicing what I would say to his face the next time I ran into him. I also considered alerting the management at the club he chased me out of, but I didn’t have to do that. Apparently he brought it to the club himself and tried to rat me out for my “rudeness,” but it totally backfired.  One of the managers approached me a few days ago and said “Justin” told her about what happened. My stomach sank at first because I thought she was going to encourage me to talk to him, but she said just the opposite. Without even hearing my side she told him that I don’t have to talk to him if I don’t want to. She also said she won’t be booking us on the same shows anymore, and that the staff knows not to allow him into the building on nights I’m performing. She said she wants me to feel safe at the club, and she’s got my back. What a win for sisterhood! After that, he tried reaching out to my SO who also shut him down and told him to leave us alone. I don’t know if he’s let it go at this point, but I’ve been making notes about everything like some people wisely suggested, and I’m feeling validated and supported. TL;DR: creep tried to rat me out for being rude, and it blew up in his face. ",Yay for creepy mother fucker getting his ass handed to him... himself!,1462

I’m seeing him again soon, thanks for all the advice! Edit 2: I posted an update on /u/jong22! Edit 3: I can’t post the update on a different account. I’m sorry :( - - - I've known my friend since high school. We go to the same university, and we live close by so we walk home together every day. Today, out of nowhere, he held my hand. He’s a really shy person so this was completely unexpected. He looked nervous, so I said that his warm hands felt nice on a cold day. He didn't expect me to reciprocate, and we just walked the rest of the way home in awkward silence.  I realized how nice it felt to hold his hand and how much I wanted to date him, so I sent this message to him shortly after arriving home: “I really liked it when you held my hand today, and I want to talk about it.” It's been a few hours and he hasn't replied back. I'm not the type of person that expects an instant reply, but he left me on read, and he usually gets back to me immediately. We were also supposed to play league of legends today, but he wouldn't get on discord or reply to any of my mentions. So what's happening here? Did I scare him away? Am I being really annoying by messaging him? Help! --- **tl;dr:** My friend held my hand while we were walking home today. I sent him a message that I liked it a lot and wanted to talk about it more, but he left me on read. He's also been ignoring my other messages for the whole day.  ","I'd say if he made a move by holding your hand he is into you. But if he's anything like me he panicked when things went well. Like everyone said, be patient, give him some time. I once had a girl try to kiss me and in my utter disbelief and panic I hugged her.... She was not understanding and it didn't work out. So don't stress, he's just shy. ",2801
8pv1v3,"My first post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8nusfi/how_do_i_31m_assure_my_wife_26f_that_she_has/). Thank you for the wonderful messages of support, advice, and even some of the harsher reality checks. I realized really quickly that the issue wasn't guilt about being a SAHM. It was that I hadn't been communicating well about money. I approached her when all of the kids were asleep/busy/etc. It wasn't the type of discussion that I wanted to get interrupted. I, as directly as I could, told her about my concerns and worries about everything with money, her feeling afraid, what everything looked like from my side and apologized that I hadn't been direct enough in telling her. She admitted that it did bother her that she didn't know how much I was making which left her blind as to what was okay/what wasn't. She also shared with me that when we were at a small get together for my family that a family member of mine (cousin, not parents or siblings) made a few snarky comments about how one of her friends was a SAHM and then her husband left her with nothing, got bitter about it, what does she do all day, yada yada. A bunch of bullshit. I guess she had also made a few comments about how a lot of men got their wife expensive gifts when they were cheating. This cousin is nothing but a raging mess who can't keep a friend or a boyfriend around for more than 3 weeks at a time. So she can go fuck herself. I don't have a big connection to her anyway. So its not like it'll cause a bunch of drama for me to block her everywhere. So we did that. I offered to let her go through my computer/phone/etc. I didn't know what else to do there to prove that I'm not cheating. Keep in mind \- she was NOT aggressively insisting it. She didn't really, actually, truly think I was cheating. The comments just made her insecure because she (her words) has baby weight to lose. My wife assured me that she didn't want to go through any of my stuff and that she trusts me. I'm still slightly fuming about any family causing drama, but thankfully I only have to see her once every few years. I figured (after I thought about it) that a serious family discussion didn't need to happen in a FA's office. At least not immediately. I did re\-give her his number and she can go see him whenever she wants if she needs assurance or something else. We sat down and talked about my income each year, how much of that was going into what, and how much was left over for ""fun"" money. Guilt started bubbling and she felt bad which is when I did whip out the prices of nannies, cleaning ladies, etc. Thanks for that suggestion. My wife (as precious as she is) made me cut down the maids portion in half because we do still have someone come in sometimes. Either way \- it was still a large amount. We talked for a few hours and I asked her if she wanted to see the FA. So we have that scheduled to go there soon. It was a long discussion that got interrupted despite our best efforts. I asked if she wanted to go therapy and she said yes. So she made me take off how much it would be to get someone to regularly come in each week off of the babysitting column of my ""this is how much money you save us"" list. So shes going to start therapy in 2 weeks. I love my wife. We talked for a long time about retirement, the kids future, money in general, how she felt about it, etc. Sorry I don't have any super exciting news or drama to report. I just wanted to tell anyone (who was curious) how it went. I know we probably still have some communication issues to work through. Her making me cut down and edit the ""list of services"" shows me that she still does have some old issues surrounding money (which she did admit to). But as long as we're going forward we'll get there. P.S She did go and buy her regular non\-cheap skincare stuff. TL;DR We had a really long talk about everything and how we would handle money going from then. A cousin had made her even more insecure that I was buying her nice things cause I was cheating (but she was already nervous before that). We talked about money and shes going to go therapy to work through issues rooting back to taking care of everyone else for years. EDIT: I can't reply to everyone, but thank you so much for your wonderful comments and messages. I hope you all find someone who makes you very happy :) ","This is such a good, heart warming update and it’s truly touching to see how much you value, care, support and love your wife.

Thanks to everyone for their advice and sharing their personal stories. It really helped assure me that I wasn't crazy.  I decided to call my dad's bluff and not change the location of the party. They text me a week ago saying I hadn't updated them on the location of the party. I simply said ""Son's party will be on this date and time at our house."" The reply was ""well maybe you all can come by the day after"". I didn't reply and just went about my business.  The party was yesterday and surprise surprise they still showed up. My dad decided to sit on the back porch the whole time and kept trying to get me to move the cake and sing happy birthday outside (which I did not do) and wanted to get the song out of the way as soon as possible. I was too busy talking to guests and hosting to even entertain him. His wife stayed in the house most of the time and even offered to help with setting things up.  At the end of the day, it was all about my son and everyone had a good time. My son even slept through the night which he never does, so win for me.  Tl;dr Didn't budge on location, dad showed up anyway  ","Excellent update! I enjoy how you were graciously immovable with your father, and then to have your son sleep through the night is the cherry on the sundae of his birthday. Well done OP :)",1897
8s52b2,"Title editorialized because it was so long to begin with. [Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lfif4/my_24f_mum_54f_has_not_seen_my_dad_52f_since/) It didn't get a lot of traction but I was asked for an update, so here it is. I write nothing but novellas. I know a lot of people wanted me to call out my dad or uninvite him entirely, or basically somehow see him get what he ""deserves"". Fair enough. I felt the same way for most of my life. But I can tell you from experience that taking the scorched earth route comes with a whole lot of negatives for me and my family, including my mom. Since my mom's family is basically also my dad's family, trust me, it's so much nicer for all of us when we just don't rock that boat. And frankly, their marriage and their parenting relationship is really not my business and definitely not my responsibility. The advice I appreciated the most and ultimately ended up following was from u/punfull who said something along the lines of: [You are a bubble floating through the breeze. You are completely unaware of any undertones or subtext or sarcasm or snottiness. You are not available for venting. You are not the mediator.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lfif4/my_24f_mum_54f_has_not_seen_my_dad_52f_since/dzfpv18/) It was such great advice that I told it to my mom, and advised that we all follow it. While punfull recommended that me and my boyfriend be the inner bubble, it ended up actually being me and my mom. Nothing went exactly to plan, of course. For one, it turned out that my graduation tickets were indeed assigned seating, so my mom, dad and boyfriend were indeed forced to sit right next to each other, right in the front so I could watch it happen from the stage. My boyfriend's dad was unexpectedly very sick and had to cancel on dinner, so we ended up having to schedule an additional event with less friends and even more mom-dad face time. At first my parents asked which one of them should be there, and I said to both of them, ""You are both invited, and I would love it if you both could come. I trust that you guys will be able to figure it out."" My dad strongly hinted that he might not want to come to dinner after all. I'm in a bubble I'm in a bubble I'm in a bubble. As expected, my Dad and his wife were somewhat obnoxious. They rented an insanely expensive car, he talked a lot about how successful they are and how much money they make/spend, he wore an expensive patterned suit when I told him to dress casually, they drank a fair bit, he paid for everything even when my mom offered just to make a point of it, and he generally tried to steal the show when possible. They got me a really gaudy graduation present that was very expensive but not really in my taste. He made a bunch of off-colour comments, etc. However, that said, everyone did show up to everything, and nothing terrible happened. Everyone followed their directions to distract my dad and support my mom. My boyfriend's parents spent all of their time engaging my mom, despite my dad's best efforts to pull them away. As expected, my boyfriend's dad spent basically the entire time telling sob stories, but my family dutifully smiled and nodded and only minorly made fun of him. Bf's dad was busy having fun putting two and two together insofar as where my personality comes from (i.e., I am Nana 2.0). My Nana kept repeating to everyone that we were 100% Team Mom. My friends kept everyone occupied so I could relax. My mom handled everything like a champ. Eventually she even walked right up to Heather super confidently and introduced herself saying, ""Hello, it's so awkward to finally meet you."" Heather practically had word vomit after that which was pretty satisfying to watch lol. My mom acted and felt very comfortable. She took pictures with me and my dad and operated the camera when it was my dad and Heather. She said she honestly felt fine. She found my dad annoying AF but she always has. I was really proud of her anyways, and I told her so. Interestingly, it was my dad that was clearly uncomfortable. He always talked louder when she came close so that she would hear him self-aggrandizing. Several times I caught him staring at her from across the table/room. Sometimes he would say something and me and my mom would laugh and roll our eyes at each other. My dad tried to make some sort of sexist joke to my boyfriend about the nursing class and he pretended not to understand. He seemed to slowly absorb that he was not the star of the show and to his credit, he never made a scene about it. And as for me, as soon as the first meeting was out of the way and nothing terrible had happened, I immediately felt more relaxed. Stuff went wrong but I literally kept saying to myself, ""I am in a bubble, I am in a bubble,"" and it would pass. I almost fell down the stairs in my long gown and high heels while walking towards the stage, and I definitely accidentally flashed the entire audience with photo evidence. But I was pretty much riding the high and it didn't seem to matter. So yeah it went well, good times all around, the last of my family just left yesterday afternoon and I am having a good time in the bathtub, enjoying sweet silence, and being officially graduated! Thanks everyone :) **TL;DR:** It happened. I followed u/punfull's advice of pretending I am in a bubble, unawares of the drama around me. My mom also followed this advice and we ignored everything that wasn't good and enjoyed everything that was. When not encouraged with attention, my dad was nothing worse than annoying. Everyone can now be considered on polite and speaking terms and nothing terrible happened except for accidentally showing the convocation audience my vagina :)","Congrats on graduating and on surviving that. Please, please, please always remind your mom what an awesome person she is. It must be so tough for her and she was the brightest star in the universe that night! ",1917
8s86ql,"Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8q10gs/my_20f_friend_21f_is_going_to_great_lengths_to/ So I posted a few days ago about my housemate Emily who had made it her life’s mission to try and make me see that my long-distance boyfriend, Sam, was cheating on me. After posting my original post I sat Emily down and told her that I would not be engaging in conversation with her about Sam at all. She tried to claim it was all in my best interests to listen to her, but did reign it in. Drama over. … Until it all blew up. I got a very angry message yesterday from Emily’s boyfriend calling me every name under the sun, including a ‘home wrecker’. I asked him what the hell was going on, and he said that he knew all about how I’d been cheating on Sam and how I’d convinced Emily to do the same to him. It turns out he’d found out that Emily was on Tinder and was talking to guys, and had even met up with a couple and done whatever. I had no clue she was doing this - whenever she left the house for the night, she always said she was staying at her boyfriend’s. I told him in no uncertain terms that I had not encouraged Emily to cheat on him, and I was not cheating on Sam. He then tried to claim that Emily had told him that I was away getting with some Tinder guy on a specific evening that I wasn’t in the flat… I was celebrating Sam’s birthday with him in his city, and had the timed and dated photos to prove it, and of course Emily knew where I really was. I have no clue whether or not her boyfriend believes me, but I haven’t had any other messages from him since. Emily was wailing my door about 10 minutes later, saying that her (ex) boyfriend had gone insane and she only cheated because he was abusive (I can’t say I saw anything, but I also can’t say this was a definite lie) and she was scared about his reaction so she said I was involved. She then said that I would understand her position if I had broken up with Sam like she wanted me to. I’ll admit, that got my attention. I asked what she meant, and she said that she had wanted us both to be ‘free’ from our partners but she knew I wouldn’t cheat on Sam so had tried her best to convince me that he was cheating so I would leave him. She got the door slammed in her face. Even if she did want an escape from her own ‘abusive’ relationship, her non-stop attempts to persuade me to leave my boyfriend just for her own gain is enough for me to just cut her off. I didn’t even wait until Emily woke up this morning to put my plan to move out into action. The landlord has been contacted and is very understanding (we’re very close to the end of our tenancy anyway) so I’m breaking my lease, and I’m going to spend the night in a friend’s spare room before making my next move. I might write her a goodbye note, but she hardly deserves it. I’ve been wondering for a while whether or not I should move to be with Sam, I think this is now going to be a big part of my decision. Also a lot of comments in the original post were suggesting that something had happened between Sam and Emily while he was still living in this area, and she was trying to make me see that without coming clean. I didn’t reply to any comments because I know the sorts of responses I would have got to ‘I know he’s not cheated on me with Emily’, but I do know he didn’t. He never contacted Emily privately, and was really only friendly to her because she was my housemate. Sam was just as unlikely to cheat with Emily as I was with any of his friends, family or housemates. I know some of you may still think that he could still have cheated/cheat in the future and I can’t definitively say he didn’t/won’t, but I’m not going to ruin my relationship with ‘what if’ style thoughts. TL;DR - Housemate who was trying to prove to me that my boyfriend was cheating was actually cheating on her boyfriend and wanted me to ‘join in’ by convincing me to dump my boyfriend. Found out from her boyfriend, who had been told that I was the one telling her to cheat on him (I wasn’t). I’m moving out as quickly as my legs will let me.","Make sure to photograph the apartment so that you can protect yourself should Emily try to damage the apartment after you break your lease.

8tq98r,"Update/More Fuel: We talked last night, and he told me he met this girl a few years ago in London while he was in a pub. They “got on”, exchanged numbers (he didn’t offer that, i had to ask). The million dollar rhetorical question: Did this happen while we were together? “Yes. Am I not allowed to get on with people?” I left the room. My mother works for a law firm and has sent me the names of immigration lawyers. I’m processing everything I need to do before I make an emotional decision and potentially screw something up. The kindness-and humor- have been stabilizing and have genuinely kept my knees from shaking. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  —————————————————————————————————————————— My husband moved here from London to marry me in February of 2017. Honestly, it was a weird transition going from long distance to suddenly living together and married, but I figured that was something we’d navigate together.  The last few months, I noticed  a change in his Whatsapp activity- constantly online, last seen time stamps at really early hours in the morning...combined with zero sex, zero touching, barely any talking,I tortured myself over what could be going on. Long story short: I confronted him about it, even used the name of the girl he was talking to (my friend was holding my husband’s phone when a message from her showed up) and he denied denied denied. Tonight, for absolutely no reason whatsoever, I decided to scroll through Venmo feed. Seriously I was just vegging out and scrolling. Saw my husband’s name, and transfer to the girl’s name with the title “Damsel in Distress.”    Confronted him. Then he told me he’s having doubts about this, about us. I do understand how difficult it has been to move from London to a suburb, but my empathy stops there. The lies continued. Tells me he booked a trip to Denver last Thursday to see “a mate”. I look up the girl on Facebook, what do you know, she lives in Denver. He then admits he was going to see her while he was there. The ease with which he lies is unnerving... So here I am. He wants to work things out. I don’t.I don’t trust he won’t come back from Denver in July and tell me it’s over, and here I was, waiting for him and twiddling my thumbs. He’s controlling the situation, and my trust in him is gone. I want to tell him to either leave now, or plan to relocate to Denver bc he clearly has intentions. How do I approach this? His “I want to try to fix this” rings hollow and leaves me open to be stomped on at his will. TL;DR: Husband has been talking to another girl, lied about it, cites difficulty adjusting here, has flights booked to go and see her, and only told me because I pushed. ","I'm sorry, you're second place.  He plans to fly to Denver to meet this girl, and if it does not work out with her, THEN he'll be kind enough to return to you - UNTIL the next girl comes along",5611
8vc871,"[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/) I know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it). Through interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.   1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested. 2.  He see someone psychologically. 3.  Couple's counseling. I decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either. He took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.   And then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time. A few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day. I headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce. I drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.   She left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for. So I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up. I worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process. More recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was. On the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own. I started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex. So I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite). I decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things. I had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this. So when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry. But nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt ""forced"" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally. He then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.   I think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.   I should have listened to my gut all along. We had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.     I don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about. Overall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other. And thank you everyone for all your help. tl/dr:  Put off divorce due to spouse's sister dying and despite everything we worked on together, found out he never really loved me.","Jesus, I'm so sorry. That is rough.  You have every right to be upset, but as you mentioned, his willingness should make the splitting process easier for you both.  You have so much left to love and give, and he seems stunted. He clearly has a lot of personal introspection that he needs to do before he can ever be in a proper relationship.  Good luck to you, you seem strong and smart, you got this. ",1503

People gave me a really hard time in my original post and it really made me realize how much of a dumbass I was being. I apologized profusely to Olivia and called out my extremely stupid behavior and basically begged for forgiveness. After a couple more days of being mad at me she was willing to talk to my parents and my brother who apologized and told her that they really loved her and that they didn’t mean to hurt her. They tried to explain the situation with my grandmother and why she behaved the way she did and they were just trying to minimize drama but that what she was saying was wrong and they should have stood up to her. My mother got her a gift set from bath and body works, costume jewelry and chocolate to go along with the apology.  So Olivia did forgive me and my family which I am so relieved about because I really am crazy about this girl. I’m definitely not going to take this for granted. A week ago my brother, Olivia and I went to an amusement park and my brother and her actually got along really well and she’s definitely convinced he doesn’t secretly hate black people. (I never thought my brother was racist - when he was in middle school he “dated” a black girl.) He's only 15 so I definitely don't blame him for what happened. It was my dad's fault for laughing. But yeah he really likes her and is glad she doesn't hate him. My mom invited Olivia to a beach with our family on Saturday (My abuela stayed at home) and although she mostly stayed by me and my brother she seemed to get along reasonably with my parents and seems to believe their apology (she was a bit hesitant to go).  I have told my grandmother that if she wants me to be actively part of her life she must apologize to Olivia. My grandmother actually agreed to apologize but my gf doesn’t want to talk to her and I told her I will not force her to be around her but I did tell her that my grandmother is sorry for the way she behaved.  So yeah that's my update. I appreciate all the replies no matter how harsh. It really made my realize my stupidity. Still have a lot of growing up to do but I am really happy she took me back.       ---      **tl;dr**: Olivia forgave me after my parents and I apologized and we are still together. She still  understandably doesn't want to talk to my grandmother though. ","You’re really lucky Olivia forgave you. Folks, it’s time to stop “trying to avoid a scene” with our racist family members.

Looking back on this post, I can’t believe what a difference 4 months has made. After posting it, I read my own words and realized that the relationship was over. I was making excuses for him and justifying staying miserable in the relationship because I just loved him so much.  We had a talk when I visited my hometown and broke up. We both were emotional but knew it was  for the best, and I was content thinking we were going to spend time being single and discovering who we are as individuals after being so close for so long.  Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. I found out he had been cheating for at least a couple months before telling me he wanted another break. He began officially dating the new girl about 3 days after we broke up and he moved in with her after a couple months of dating. He has always been super resistant to commitments before, so that came as a shock. My self esteem took a huge hit.  Now things are different. I discover new things about myself every day, I spend time with my friends who make me feel loved and important, and I’m truly happy for the first time in a long time. At first I wanted to start dating again and I told myself I was ready, but the truth is that there’s so much I don’t know about myself yet, and I want to get to know me before I focus on another relationship.  Anyway, thank you to the people who commented and let me know that something was going on. As obvious as it was to them, I was completely blindsided. I’m just grateful to be out of that situation and I’m excited for what’s ahead. Tl;dr : we broke up, he was cheating, I’m much better now",Congrats! I'm glad you're happier now :),1720
8wwfsw,"Original Post: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8w5vf1/i_30f_just_found_my_fiance_30m_on_an_online/ I posted a few days ago because I found my fiance on an online dating site. I took reddit's advice and catfished him... A few hours after I set the bait, I found that his profile had been deleted. When he came home from work I showed him the screen shot and asked him what was up. Long story short, He was hanging out with his coworker and the coworker was frustrated with figuring out how to navigate the ame dating site. My fiance signed into his old account (opened in 2013) to try to help his friend figure it out. Apparently a lot had changed on this particular site and he realized that his knowledge on the site was too out of date so he logged out and that was it. A few days later he saw in his email that he had gotten a message from a woman on the site and he then deleted his account. He obviously couldn't show me his dating site account, but he did volunteer to show me his email account with all the alerts from the site, the only woman that had messaged him recently was clearly my fake account. He also realized when we were looking through his email that he had an unused old profile on another dating site, he signed in and deleted that one in front of me. I fessed up about catfishing him. He wasn't upset at all. Said he understood completely considering my history. He was more upset with himself for not realizing that his behavior would make me so insecure. I apologized for not trusting him and catfishing. He apologized for being so distant lately and not deleting his dating profiles ages ago. He offered an open phone/social media/email policy between us, in case we ever stumble across another ""trust but verify"" type of situation. Tl;Dr: It was an old profile. He signed in to try to help a friend figure out the app. He saw the message from my catfishing attempt, thought they were real and deleted his profile. We talked it over, no one is mad. Life is good.",This is the best ending. More endings like this please.,1465

My post didn't get a lot of attention, but I wanted to update the people who commented and sent me PMs. I applied for the job. I landed an interview. I got the job. I told my mom the day I got the call for the interview that I applied for it, and now I had an interview in a few days. She wasn't too pleased that I didn't tell her I applied for the job anyway, but she quickly got over it when I informed her again that I would love to get the job and if I did get it, I saw myself staying with the organization for probably the rest of my life. She became excited for me, and the day before I left to go to the interview, she expressed how much she was proud of me for following my dreams, like she did not, and not letting anyone stop me, like she did. She wished me good luck and told me that she knew I'd do great. I start the new job in a few weeks, which will give me plenty of time to get my things together and prepare for a huge move in my life. My boss is extremely excited for me (tbh, I think she helped get me the job. I listed her as a reference, and she knows most of the people I'll be working with), and can't wait to see me succeed in this new position (conservation is a small world). Thank you to those who told me to go for the job anyway, because without that push from strangers, I don't think I would have applied. **tl;dr**: I applied for a dream job with a dream company, landed an interview, and accepted the job.

We officially broke up a few weeks ago, and he moved his furniture out of our apartment this week. I received incredibly varied advice from my original post. I took all of it into consideration, and let him read the post as well. We tried our very best over the last few months to move past this, but we were not able to. Breaking up seemed like the only option left. To all of you that told me that he wanted to be with me, but didn't want to get married, you were right. I didn't want to believe it, but after months of circular conversations, it came back every time. He just didn't want to get married, he didn't feel like he was ready, and he didn't know when he would be. Basically I wanted to post an update on this thread because I needed to get it off my chest. I always figured that maybe some of you were in similar situations and you were hoping to eventually hear the outcome. Thank you to everyone who had originally commented on my post! You definitely gave me a lot to think about. TLDR: \*\*6 year relationship ends after disagreement on planned marriage/proposal\*\*",I’m so sorry.  But thank you for sharing. The timing of your post is hitting me hard. My boyfriend of 11 years told me in April that he would propose in July. This was not our first discussion. He texted me a little while ago today that he had some errands after work and would be late getting home. One might think that’s a good sign. But I think he was just out buying clothes. I think he’ll have more excuses when I talk to him on Aug 1st. Your post makes me wonder if it’s worth trying to salvage things after that. ,4102
92ssov,"Wendy and I have been friends for several years. We used to live in the same city and see one another often. I knew she had a history of traumatic relationships and had hence decided not to date, but I also knew she had a pretty intense crush on a friend of a friend I had never met, James. When I moved to another state, we stayed in touch via phone calls. She told me that her feelings for James were becoming stronger, despite the fact that they had no contact. Soon, she began telling me that they were in love but his ex-girlfriend was preventing them from being together. Because these conversations became so odd, I stopped the calls and stepped away from the friendship.  This week, I visited my former city on an impromptu trip and met up with Wendy. She told me the exciting news that her and James were finally getting married after this ex had kept them apart so long. She showed me photos of a home he bought her, of horses he bought her, and of her in a wedding dress. She told me the name of the venue and invited me. Then she dropped the bombshell that James is apparently a millionaire.  All of this seemed off to me and when I got home, my concerns mounted. Her house was not packed despite the fact she is supposedly moving imminently. Money seems tight for her, she is living in relative squalor, if she has a millionaire fiance, why isn't he helping her?  I did some digging. I found the house she showed me on Zillow, still for sale. I found the horses on a website for a local ranch that does tours. I called the venue and they told me they are unbooked on the supposed wedding date. All the available evidence tells me that she is not getting married. My gut tells me that her and James are not even in a relationship or have any contact.  I don't know what to do next. Do I confront her? Do I warn James? Are these simply lies or are they delusions and the symptom of a serious mental illness? How do I help her? TLl;DR: My friend claims to be getting married, all evidence points to that being a lie or delusion. ","My sister tells fantastic lies kind of like this. She's never invented a millionaire fiancé, but she has a whole story about how at age 14 she leapt into a flooded river to try to rescue a drowning kayaker, and another story about how she was doing sound for a famous band and in the middle of the show the lead singer stopped the show to talk about how beautiful she was. I guess what I'm saying is that, based on my experience with this kind of thing, the person telling the lies is not exactly delusional but more driven by a pathological need to impress other people and to portray their self and their life as better, the best, just so amazing.  I suspect your friend is having a fairly bad time and really, really does not want to admit that she's single and poor. Of course I may be wrong and James may end up locked in her basement.",4130
949kg5,"My father was diagnosed with lung cancer 11 months ago. This was a very hard time, my father and I were close and it was just horrible to see him this sick. My best friend and I are friends since we were both 4 years old. I thought real, lifelong friends.  My best friend was on a trip in New-Zealand for most of the time when my father was ill. She did not have much internet access so we did not speak much. I informed her about my dad often but since there were some internet problems we didn't talk much. My father died 1.5 months ago. My best friend was back in the country for a month when it happend.  Her reaction when I told about the passing; omgg i am so sorry are you ok? I said; well, not too well but what can i do.. I was obviously very sad. She then started talking about a fight she had with a friend of her. I was quite shocked but just talked along with her. My father had a small funeral, only the closest family members were allowed. After the convo where I told my friend that he passed; she never asked about him again. This is 1.5 month ago. Not once did she ask about the funeral, how I feel, nothing. I am so baffled and sad. I always have her back when she had troubles. Now I feel like she does not care at all. What can  I do? She is basically my only friend..i have social issues that's why. **TL;DR my father died and my best friend doesn't seem to care. It hurts. **  UPDATE;  **Wow. I am so overwhelmed by all the sweet comments. Thank you so much, it really makes me feel a lil better in these difficult times. I will politely discuss my feelings with my friend and then see how she reacts. Thank you reddit ❤**","I am so sorry that you've lost your father at such a young age. I lost my father when I was 16. I've been exactly where you are so I hope I might be able to help you out here. Unfortunately, it's not all good. Teenagers tend to be fundamentally self-centered. No offense meant. It's just kind of a fact of nature. Most kids your age are completely unprepared to deal with something as serious and impactful as this. Their typical response will be to just ignore it. It's awful, but they're really not equipped to do much else. I'm sure you've noticed this in other areas. You probably feel that most of your peers are still living in a naïve, childish world where everything is easy and the biggest concern is who is dating who. While you have been forced to grow up and face the real world. When my father died, I also lost my best friend and our small group that we hung out with. They stopped calling, stopped inviting me out, and I eventually quit trying. It was hard. It hurt a lot and it honestly still hurts a little bit. But as a result, I was forced to seek out new friends (I had social issues as well) and become much closer to the couple of acquaintances that didn't push me away. I found much kinder, empathetic, and overall better people to be friends with. Those people are still my best friends. I think you should reach out to your friend and tell her how you feel. Try not to be accusatory or attack her. Tell her that you're having a very hard time, you miss her, and you could really use her help getting you through this. Don't make it about the fact that she's been neglectful because that will just make her defensive. Make it about the fact that you need her help right now. She may step up to the task or she may not, but you should let her know that you need her help. If it doesn't work out, you should know that there are so many other great and worthwhile people out there to make lifelong friendships with. Most people don't end up staying best friends with the friends they made at 4. You're going to make lots of new friends as a young adult that will be in a mental place to empathize with you, cry with you, and love you.   Again, I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. Please do not hesitate to seek out grief counseling and other forms of therapy.  Edit: I'd like to add a little more to give some insight into your friend's headspace. It's very hard to know what to do in these situations. My best friend just lost his father a few months ago and even with my experience, I still struggled to figure out what to say and how to reach out. I love the dude, but I didn't know what he needed from me. It may just be that she's scared of saying something wrong and making things worse. If you reach out to her and let her know what you need from her, she might be happy to help you out. It's very possible that she's just scared and doesn't know how to approach the situation.",1934
94lmrw,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92wuub/my_boss_24m_is_dating_my_ex_19f_and_now_i_19m/) Thanks to everyone who gave me advice on my first post. For the past week, I've been trying to focus on myself and my work and not care about my ex and my boss who's dating her. It worked pretty well, I started a painting and I'm pretty close to finishing it and I impressed my boss boss (the professor who owns the lab, not the one dating my ex) by staying late for two days in a row to finish a really difficult experiment. During our lab meeting, my boss boss shouted me out in front of the entire lab and said he was really impressed by my hard-work and dedication. That felt good. As for the situation with my boss and my ex, he found out. Like I mentioned in my previous post, when my ex told me who her new boyfriend was, I didn't mention that he was my boss so neither of them knew. Two days ago, my boss and us (two other undergrads) were in a conference room discussing a paper when my ex came in. She came to drop off my boss's wallet that I think he forgot or something. Anyway, she saw me, did a double-take and went, ""Jaaaake?!"". She was definitely super surprised and caught off-guard and her boss was already like ""wtf"" so I was just like, ""heeeyy 'Sarah'"". She shot me another shocked wide-eyed look and left. Suffice to say the rest of the meeting was pretty awkward.  The next day, it was obvious that my boss now knew our history. Things just turned so awkward. Like he didn't now how to act around me anymore and what to say. Now we're both awkward around each other. He's still nice and all but things are just uncomfortable between us two now. It's not his fault though. I think that things will get better between the two of us but as of right now, I actually feel kind of relieved that he now knows. Something about how both of us now don't know how to act and what to do kind of makes me feel reassured. ""Sarah"" also called me the night that she found out I worked there but I missed her call and forgot to call back. It's good though, I've been trying to think of her less and distance myself a bit.   But if things continue to remain really awkward to the point where both of our work is affected, I'll consider talking to my boss boss about switching me to work under another grad student instead.  But yea, that's about all. Again, thanks for the help guys. TL;DR: Been focusing on myself and my work. Boss found out that I'm his girlfriend's ex and things are now awkward but bearable.  ","I am actually sort of glad you didn’t answer your Ex’s phone call or return it. I cannot imagine, for the life of me, any usefulness to that conversation.  I mean, did she not know anything about the department you were in at school? Or the likelihood of seeing you if she kept her dating pool there? IMHO, you really demonstrated an ability to be above drama by not immediately telling your boss or Sara about your previous work/romantic relationship.  And i’m super stoked that, instead, you just focused on work and got praised by your boss boss. Good for you! ",2157

I should have left that night. Not too long after posting that, the emotional abuse finally turned physical. I was held hostage in my home for over an hour while I was assaulted, demeaned, and scared for my life. I left that night.  It was a hard road. I’ve questioned myself, my sanity, and sometimes even whether I did the right thing. Emotional abuse took a huge toll on my psyche and self-worth.  I am happy to say, though, that life has drastically improved for the better. I bought a new home for my kids and I. We’ve got a sweet dog and two precious kitties. My son just started 2nd grade and really enjoyed his first day. Everything is falling into place. I feel horrible for what I put them through, and I know there will probably be rough patches ahead, but we are infinitely better off than where we were.  If you read my original post and it resonates for you, please take the advice of the commenters. Get. Out. Leave. No one deserves that sort of treatment, and it’s only going to get worse.

Unfortunaly things with my family escalated as this kind of things do. I’m fine as I already have some experience with them going crazy lol. My poor brother, on the other hand, was completely blindsided but we talked and I helped him set up some security devices/tips to avoid our parents. This did made things take a weird twist and now the whole family is convinced I somehow turned my brother gay(which, ignoring the glaring HOW, is the why I’d do this) and I’m the bad influence. Nothing like waking up to your mom blowing your phone saying you’re going to hell eh? My brother is pretty shocked and confused. This, at least, gave me the opportunity(after a couple of beers) to talk with him about our family, how I was treated and so. He was pretty heart broken and feeling guilty but I did my best to show him it wasn’t his fault. I think this conversation really made us closer and made me feel more at ease with the situation. A week or so later he asked if I was alright(I tend to freeze when I’m awkward) and I explained I was a bit intimidated by awesome-ness(not like this lol). He was actually very understanding and said he knew exactly how I felt. Then he started talking a bit about his fuck ups and how he screwed things up. This helped a lot to take him off the pedestal I had put him in. Right now our relationship is great, I regularly have dinner with them, they met my friends and we’re both supportive of each other situation with our family. I don’t think he’s going to return contact with them, at least until they truly apologize, stop blaming me and accept his husband. Overall, I’m still not sure of what the future holds, I’m still awkward and kinda flopping around life trying to do things but I’m not so insecure and now I know I have my brother to help me out. Thanks for all the advices guys! TL;DR: my family got even crazier but at least this made my brother and I closer. I talked about how I was a bit intimidated and he was great. Life is still hard but things are better now",Your family sounds toxic and I would seriously consider cutting them out. Life is too short and you don't need that negativity in your life.

A background piece not included in my original post is that all the players in this scenario are connected by a recovery community. Because of this connection, I knew the ""ex"", Ashley, some years ago and we were still on one another's social media. I decided to reach out and ask about James. That evening Ashley called me and we then conferenced in James. As it turns out, he is married to another woman and they have a child. He and Ashley never dated and aren't even really friends, they simply used to chat at a large meeting that was also attended by my friend, Wendy. They believe that she saw them speaking there and created a delusion that they had dated and Ashley was now poisoning James against Wendy, all the while he was married to another woman.  Over the course of the last two years, Wendy has approached James at multiple meetings with declarations of love. He reiterated to her each time that he was married and stopped attending that meeting to avoid her. But oddly, she ended up at his meetings again and again. She approached his sponsor and friends telling them they were in love. She also approached Ashley threatening her with a restraining order because she believed Ashley was conspiring against James and her, as a couple, because they were ""together"" now. The second time she approached her, six months ago, Ashley called the police and made a report.  Until our conference call, Ashley and James didn't realize how they were connected and they didn't know the extent of the delusions. When I told them about the marriage date, they were very concerned. James called the police. I called the emergency mental health line looking for help, but their only suggestion was to call the police and ask for a welfare check on Wendy, which I did. Knowing that she has no connection to James and is living in a complete delusion made me so concerned for her. Once the wedding date came and she didn't get married, what would happen? How would she mentally process that?  I was given a reference number and when I called back, was told they made contact but did not intake her since she didn't appear dangerous. Since the check, she has ignored my calls. The wedding date came and passed and I heard nothing. At this time I feel like I lost a friend, but she was already gone in these delusions and I did what I could to help.  Going forward, I hope to get updates from other people in the community that she is doing better, and hopefully abandons these delusions. TL;DR: There was no wedding or relationship, James is a real person with no connection to Wendy, she was fully delusional. ","OP, what’s safest for you is to worry about taking care of yourself. She doesn’t seem like a safe friend. She’s not your sponsor. She has bigger problems than you can handle.  You did the right thing with this situation. ",554
96zhur,"Update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95s4ri/recently_found_out_that_i_17m_got_into_my/) On Saturday I was able to speak to my brother and tell him that I got into the university. He was really happy for me, like a lot of people said he would be. When I told him I got in he gave me a huge hug and was really excited. It was such a huge relief.  He asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out.  When I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad.  We talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great.   Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is. TL;DR told my brother I got into the university and he incredibly supportive and happy for me. He told me not limit my success to make other people more comfortable, and that he was proud of me (which meant a lot to hear).",Your brother sounds amazing!

99zefi," You can read the original thread at [this link ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/99dlda/i_24f_think_my_dads_ex_girlfriend_50sf_is/) First I want to clear some things up about my job. I work 4AM-8PM Monday through Friday. I get paid for driving, so the 2 hour commute to and from work is included in those hours, not on top of them. I don’t work for any school - my company is a contractor with many different schools. It is illegal to make employees work so many hours where I live, but most of the people who work here either don’t care because the money is so good or they quit early on. I don’t want to say what I do specifically because from there it would be easy to find out what company I work for which I imagine could get me in legal trouble. I didn’t want to call my doctor yesterday because I was afraid to leave work and because I didn’t want my coworkers or anyone at the school to hear what was going on. However, I ended up doing so because I noticed there was a teacher with my last name (which is also my dad’s, and is quite rare unlike the girlfriend’s common name) and I panicked a little. I excused myself to the bathroom and called my doctor, who advised me to come in, and then I told me coworkers I had to leave because of a medical emergency. I was not medicated before, but I have now started a new medication which will hopefully work. I have some mental exercises that I used the one other time I have had a really bad delusion like this (I thought my house was infested with fleas but they were really just on the dog) and they’re helping to ground me. I think I am afraid of my dad trying to get back into my life (he does this every so often) which is why I jumped straight to thinking it was his ex stalking me, and my doctor agrees. I also have put in my two weeks notice at work. I have enough money to get by for the next few months if I can’t get another job right away, and this job is destroying me physically and mentally.

9a7ovz,"[Link to original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/96tmu5/my_26f_coworker_found_my_boyfriend_27m_on_tinder/) My (26F) last post didn't get too much attention, but I figured I would update as 1.) it's cathartic and 2.) things got pretty intense. Essentially, if you didn't read the last post, my coworker's housemate spotted my boyfriend (27M) on Tinder. He said he didn't use it. Which was clearly a lie, as many of you stated. I truly wanted to believe him when I made the post, even though my gut (and the evidence really) told me not to. So I made a fake profile with one picture and no bio and searched for him with no luck, I matched people to keep the algorithm working but didn't send messages. I left it at that for the time-being. I saw my boyfriend last weekend and I still didn't get an explanation. Or an apology. Or anything even near the truth. So I decided to snoop (edit: through his messages). I'm not proud and I owned up to it, partially because he had some weird exchanges with girls. This isn't important to the story, but when I confronted him, I got half-assed responses and we continued to hardly speak throughout this week. He also is currently at a festival this weekend, so I was still feeling even more insecure. I had no explanation for TWO possible cheating situations now. I was a bit tipsy last night and decided to bring up the old fake profile, setting the distance on maximum to pick up the festival location. And what do you know, he appeared. I was too afraid to match him so I messaged my coworker's housemate. She stopped by my job the other day to introduce herself and apologise for the whole situation. Apparently her ex-boyfriend also had a tinder profile and that's why she ended things with him -- she said she had my back and would keep an eye out for me. I thought she wouldn't find him when I told her, as I was under the impression that profiles disappear after you swipe left. However, she found him and they matched. I texted my boyfriend immediately saying it was over because he's still on Tinder and here's where it gets insane. He responded that his best mate has apparently been chatting on Tinder with a girl from my country and living in my current city. My coworker's housemate is from my country, which is super rare. It honestly wouldn't surprise me that she would get on with my boyfriend's best mate. I know she has friends that live in his town and is there from time to time, because she said that's why his profile came up straight straight away. Anyway -- when my boyfriend's mate went on about her, he thought I was being a catfish so apparently he decided to download Tinder at the festival to try to catch me. Honestly, I can sort of see why he'd think that in a roundabout way because we're very similar. Still, I told him that his accusation and excuse for being on Tinder was ridiculous, although I owned up to making a fake profile to try to find him. I also said I know the girl who was chatting his mate, because she's the one that found him originally and matched with again him today. I then reiterated that we were through because there is obviously zero trust between the two of us. I don't think I was right in snooping and making a fake profile, but I felt as if I deserved the truth. I also asked if I needed to go to the GUM clinic, even though I'll go anyways. He said he would respond tomorrow, but it's well into the afternoon and nothing. Closure is overrated, I guess. I'm pretty numb to the whole situation, although I'm gutted that I'll lose our mutual friends because I'll be the crazy ex who catfished their mate. ​ tl;dr -- My now-ex-boyfriend 'wasn't on tinder' but I caught him on it at a festival. Instead of owning up to it, he accuses me of catfishing his best mate. Our relationship is over. ​ ​ ​","Don't feel ashamed about following through on your suspicions, and don't just assume your mutual friends will choose him.  Keep showing up, maintain connections, and let him deal with the discomfort of knowing that you are still around. You aren't in the wrong here.",3275
9aojry,"My friend came to me yesterday at lunch with screenshots of my boyfriend's tinder profile. The pictures were all old photos so I confronted him immediately expecting to hear something like ""Yeah, haha I forgot to delete that."" which is cool. He denied being on tinder at all and my friend suggested that she make an account, set it to his specifications, and see if he turns up. and there's his profile. So, this means that my boyfriend has been active on tinder within the past two weeks. I confronted him with this and he changed his story. Now he's saying that his friend has been using his account. He shows me his phone and says, ""Look, I have nothing to hide."" and of course the app is deleted. So I take his phone, download tinder, log in with his facebook and see that he has been active, albeit infrequently. There was one girl that he tried to meet up with back in May when I was out of town. The girl gave him her phone number and even though he deleted whatever messages they exchanged, I still saw that he had her saved in his contacts. So that's about everything that I know. He either cheated on me or planned on cheating on me while I went out of town, and I'm sure this isn't the only time it's happened. This relationship is pretty much over. He is swearing up and down that it's not true. He doesn't use tinder and he doesn't know this girl. I'm going crazy with how much he's outright lying. He seems so sincere, but I KNOW what I saw. I can't listen to him deny this one more time. I know that this is the end, I guess I'm looking for advice on how to end it in a way that doesn't leave me second guessing myself. and moral support. TL;DR: Caught my boyfriend on tinder trying to meet up with girls while I was out of town. He's denying it so vehemently that I almost believe him. What do I do? Edit: This blew up while I was away!I'm sorry I won't be able to respond to every comment. So I did some stuff that was kind of petty and stupid today: I made a fake tinder account, matched with my boyfriend, and he starts messaging me and immediately asks me to meet him for a drink. We agree to meet by a fountain in the center of my town and I pack up all of his stuff in a tote bag, put on a great outfit and went to the fountain. I stood kind of out of the way of the fountain in the shadows where I could watch the street that I knew he'd be arriving from. I was devastated, but I figured this way I could catch him without a doubt and end things quickly. All the time, he's messaging this girl on tinder. But he didn't show up. Two of his roommates did. We didn't speak (I don't know them well), but they watched me for a while, figured out what was going on after a few more tinder messages, and left quickly. So I wait a few minutes and I call my boyfriend and ask him where he's at. He says he's just gotten off of work and he's going to meet his roommate for a drink. I confront him with the fake tinder profile and he's dumbstruck and furious with his roommate, who he swears up and down is behind all of this. I'm at home now, just emotionally exhausted and confused. Whatever is going on with his roommates is super sketchy and creepy. advice please? Edit part two: Thank you all so much for your advice and support! A few things that I think are important * Up until this point my boyfriend and I had a great relationship. Really, no red flags anywhere. If I had already been suspicious that he was cheating this would be a much easier break for me * The most recent message on his tinder account when I checked it yesterday was sent to a girl he had matched with before we met. It said ""Would you want to meet up with my friend?"" * My boyfriend is the kind of person who's iphone passcode is 0000. I wouldn't be surprised if his roommates did know all of his passwords.  &#x200B; So, his tinder account is still matched with my fake profile. To me, that indicates that he probably isn't the person operating the tinder profile. If it were him, wouldn't he have blocked the fake profile immediately? &#x200B; A lot of people have said that he probably sent his roommates to check things out for him. I can't write that off entirely but my gut says that it isn't true. I just don't think it's very likely.  &#x200B; When it comes to his roommates, I'm very concerned that they have been using his profile to trick women into meeting with them. The fact that his profile hasn't been deleted makes me worry that my boyfriend is in on this. So that's about where I'm at right now. I'm worried that all of them are working together to at best, scam women, at worst, assault them and my boyfriend is at least passively involved. Either way, I feel some responsibility to do a little more digging. ","Gaslighting. That’s what this is. And this is exactly what my boyfriend did to me when I caught him cheating. I was literally logged into his POF account looking at the messages and he was trying to deny it, and trying to make me seem crazy for believing it. You are not crazy, he is a cheater. You are not crazy. One more time for good measure: YOU ARE NOT CRAZY no matter how he makes you feel about this. ",4383
9du198,"I'm an idiot. I'll try to keep this short. Also, I was a bit drunk when this happened. Noah and I have been best friends since 2nd grade. We live together with one other friend near the college we go to together. He came out to me when we were in high school. It didn't change anything. When we got to college, I came out as bisexual. Last night we were hanging out with some friends and I had a bit to drink. When we were walking home I could tell he was nervous so I asked what was up. He asked if I wanted to go out with him. He literally said ""do you want to go out with me"". I don't know why, but I thought he meant as friends. Thinking back he made it really obvious it was a date, but I'm an idiot and I was still a bit drunk. I said yes. He suggested Saturday night. I said yes. I left to go to the gym before he got up so I didn't see him. While I was at the gym, the friend we live with texted me that Noah was really happy this morning and she didn't know we were going to go on a date. She congratulated me and said we make a cute couple. This happened literally six minutes ago. I'm panicking right now. I don't know what to do. I love him but he's like my brother. I can't go out with him. How can I tell him I'm not interested without embarrassing him more than I have to? I don't want to mess up our relationship. We're supposed to have lunch together in a few hours. What do I do? tldr: I'm an idiot. My best friend asked me out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date. How do I fix this as easily as possible for him? UPDATE: Thank you guys so much for the advice. I only saw the first 30 something comments until just now, and I'm blown away by how many people have commented to give me advice. I tried to take a lot of the advice I got, but some of it was contradictory so I couldn't do all of it. Thanks again to everyone who gave advice, even if I didn't see it until after we talked. I texted Noah and asked if we could skip lunch and go home instead so we could talk. I tried not to make the conversation dramatic. I apologized to him for misunderstanding him, and told him I knew it must have taken a lot of courage for him to ask me out. I told him that he was my best friend, I loved him, and that would never change, but I had never thought about a romantic relationship with him. I apologized for fucking up and getting his hopes up. He asked a few questions, like did I really not know he meant it as a date. He apologized for ""fucking things up"" between us, but I told him that I wasn't uncomfortable with him feeling that way about me. I told him that I understood if he wanted space to process it, and I would give it to him if he wanted, but I also told him how important he is to me and how much I love him. He said he didn't think he wanted space. He just wanted to try to move on with the secret out. We've always been totally open with each other (well, except for him liking me I guess) and he said he was happy he wasn't keeping his feelings a secret anymore. We had a cheesy moment where I told him he could always talk to me, about anything. It was like straight out of a romcom. We talked for a long time after that. Apparently he's had a crush on me since before he came out in high school, and after he had a few drinks last night he decided fuck it, why not try. By the time he had to leave for his class this afternoon, things felt normal. I don't feel weird knowing about his crush, and he doesn't seem to feel hurt or anything because of my fuck up. Maybe just a little sad. I'll definitely keep an eye on how we interact and how he acts for a while. A few people warned me against accidentally flirting with him, and I'll try to keep anything like that in check. I guess this is a happy ending. I know there are still things to be aware of, but right now it looks like the conversation went pretty well. Thanks everyone for commenting and supporting. It helped me not just with advice but also with calming me down when I was really panicky this morning.","There's no easy fix. Contact him and clarify: ""Noah, did you ask me out on a date or are we going out as friends?"" It's going to hurt him regardless. The less time you allow him to dream about this, the fewer fantasies he can build. Likely, rejection is the end of your friendship, but it's more fair that way than him sticking around to think he'll eventually have a chance. ",2325

His other unsuspecting girl reached out to me to tell me the details and saved me from further heartache. They’re now together and he has contacted me in an attempt to get me back. I’m not interested, but should I tell her? &#x200B; Update: Sorry for the delayed update for anyone that was interested, but I moved and life has been hectic. I read every comment on the original post and considered every option. A couple weeks after my ex initially contacted me via email, he sent me a text message asking if I would ever talk to him again. Like before, I didn't respond. A couple days after I moved, I messaged his gf/the previous ""other woman"" on Facebook since that was my only form of contact with her. I first asked if they were together, to which she responded ""yes"" a couple days later. In a brief conversation I told her that I felt I owed her the courtesy since she once extended the same to me. I told her he had contacted me twice in the last month and gave her the gist of his email. She said she figured that's why I was contacting her, said she really appreciated me telling her, thanked me, and said she hoped I was doing well. I told her good luck and went on my merry way. No catfighting, no unnecessary chatting.  In the end, I feel bad for her. Yeah, she made the horrible decision to get back with him but I'm sure she did hoping/thinking he had changed. He never will. Men like that don't. I was his unwitting fool for nearly 5 years, now she has that burden. I haven't heard from him since or heard anything from his family who still occasionally keep in touch as to whether she dumped him or not...my gut instinct is she didn't. Either way, my conscience is clear, a ""favor"" has been returned, and I'm still happily no longer with a cheater. Cheers folks! &#x200B; TL;DR - Contacted the gf, told her everything, she said thanks, we went our separate ways. No Jerry Springer.",You did the right thing. ,1504

I dwindled my days down to 2 and have recently started training at my new job the remainder of the week.  I developed alopecia and started losing my hair from the stress. I was not going to allow this woman to take my hair along with my sense of self worth.  The news went better than expected when I explained I was leaving. Of course I didn't tell her my true reasoning, I cited somewhat truths to keep her happy and my side gig secured with her.  She offered a huge raise and other benefits, but nothing could keep me there, minus her pressence.  She said I was irreplaceble. Too late for praise now, maybe you should have treated me with respect. I didn't say this, though I wanted to, oh how I wanted to.  2 decades of stress, anxiety , and being talked down to by my boss is officially coming to an end and I have the very kind redditors who messaged me and responded with words of encouragement to thank. Some of you offered to help me write a resume and some even offered me a job. If I could hug you guys I would, I'm truly that grateful.  My poor replacement is already feeling her wrath. I have warned her and told her to not allow herself to be a doormat. She's young, so I'm worried she's a bit naive, as was I and will accept the abuse.  I was offered a job as soon as I mentioned wanting to quit to a friend. I have benefits and work in a laid back atmosphere where I'm adjusting to not working under a narcissistic , bullying dictator. I'm learning I don't have to apologize constantly over the smallest mistakes to my new boss to keep them calm and happy. It's absolutely refreshing.   Thank you. **Edit :**Holy hell, reading these comments there are far too many clones my ""boss"" out there lurking amoung us.   If my story sounds familiar, please work on an exit plan. This is not normal. This is an abusive relationship. The longer you stay the more ammunition they compile to use against you to keep you.

9jxf3j,"Warning, wall of text - but suffice to say this isn't your typical MIL move in post. My wife and MIL have a toxic relationship. Most of it is related to my MIL allowing her ex husband to savagely beat my wife as a child and refusing to leave the realationship, even lying for her husband when my wife was finally old enough to tell someone. It only stopped when he abandoned the family for a younger woman and eventually died.  Despite this my wife has saved her mother time and time again. MIL had a Brain tumor when we first got married and her husband at that time wanted to refuse treatment. We basically kidnapped her , took her to the best treatment center, paid thousands of dollars out of our pocket to ensure she got the best treatment and let her live with us for 6 months , my wife quitting her job to be her caretaker, getting her to rehab before moving her back home when she was well enough to be self sufficient. She was given a second chance by my wife. Her husband never visited in that 6 months. How did she repay my wife? A few months later called her on her birthday and accused her of stealing $300. Keep in mind she had lived with us for 6 months, we took care of everything, including thousands of dollars in medical bills but her husband had become enraged over a check she had written to my wife when she offered to help with some bills ONE time. She actually threatened charges so my wife despondently hung up, I immediately wrote a check (it wasn't about the money) and a letter about how much she had hurt my wife and they only spoke rarely for the next 5 years. One of those conversations was an intervention to ask her mother to please pay for a long term care policy as now that we had children we couldn't repeat the financial commitment we had made earlier. it was about $300 per month and we offered to pay half. Her mother is high maintenance and spends quite a bit on herself but refused to pay anything so we didn't do it. Fast forward to 6 months ago, MIL had a serious fall and her terrible husband let her lie on the driveway for 3 hours because he didn't want to pay for an ambulance. He got his redneck kids to pick her up and take her to ER further injuring her. She was completely unable to walk for 4 months and now is barely able, has trouble dressing herself and going to the bathroom.  Of course my wife saved her again because her husband had her in a terrible facility and she was calling my wife begging to be saved. We took her to a rehab place near us (we live 10 hours away from her home) her insurance paid for 90 days but the last 3 months we've been paying thousands out of pocket while hoping she can qualify for PACE. She doesn't qualify because she's still married and her husband has plenty of assets. He refuses to visit or help out with bills. Her only option is to divorce him and sue him to sell the assets to get herself some sort of cash or at least qualify for Medicaid. She's been kicked out of her current assisted living for refusing rehab and berating staff (she's racist) we simply can't afford to put her somewhere else so until she is divorced she's going to have to live with us. This is a depressing reality and my wife has admitted she hates her mother, gets no joy from their realationship but feels responsible for her care. We have a two story home with our master on the bottom so we are having to make our kids share a room and sleep in a small guest room upstairs for the foreseeable future. This would be easier to swallow if MIL was grateful or helpful in anyway. She's bossy, entitled, horrible to our children, and just a weird petty person. This isn't just my opinion, I've sat in my wife's therapy sessions and heard her say all these things about MIL. My wife knows how terrible she is, how much I dislike her (but don't show it to MIL) but I  understand how my wife has to do this. Any tips on making it work? I honestly don't want to be at my home.  I'd rather work late, travel more and be out of that place. I love my wife and kids and would miss them terribly but MIL makes me miserable and my wife miserable abd she lashes out at me and the kids. Gonna try to suck it up and deal with it but the future isn't bright  TL;DR: horrible MIL moving in for foreseeable future, I'd rather go get my own place, need coping tips","Your wife is going to live the next several years to possibly decades dealing with this terrible woman, and all because she feels guilty? That’s what abuse does. She’s feeding into the cycle. Your wife needs to break it. The fact that she feels it’s her responsibility to give up her happiness for the sake of family is super unhealthy and I’d worry about how that’s going to impact any children you have. Your wife needs to be able to set healthy standards, because people that don’t often end up showing signs of being negligent and abusive, even if they are the sweetest people otherwise.  Go to couples therapy. Ask your wife to go to therapy on her own too. ",3330
9kznlb,"I’m kind of in shock right now. I decided yesterday to end my 9 month relationship...we have been arguing constantly recently and it was turning toxic. It had got to the point where my bf said his mom has overheard our arguments and he said she thinks I treat him like shit. (Im not sure if this is entirely true as his mom has always been absolutely lovely to me) Regardless i was so mortified to hear that, embarrassed and ashamed,  so I said that is a prime example of why we shouldn’t be together. He said it didn’t matter what anyone else thinks and he wanted to work through things. In my mind though things had gone too far and we needed to split. I told him in person yesterday when I was at his house that we needed to break up , that the arguing was too much and it wasn’t good for either of us . Id brought his belongings that he’d left at mine and I tried to be as nice as possible. He turned on me and said “no way, you’re not doing this to me you fucking idiot. How dare you come round here with the intention of breaking up? Are you mental? Are you sick in the head?” He called me the most disgusting names.  I said I needed to leave and I was sorry but he locked the front door and wouldn’t let me go. It was only us two in the house at the time. I begged for him to let me leave and he wouldn’t. Instead he started to interrogate me about the reasons I wanted to leave. Kept wanting to know if I’d met someone else and was I leaving him for another guy. I couldn’t get to my cell phone as it was in my purse out of reach so I couldn’t call anyone for help. Then he changed tactic and said  we can work things out, backtracked on the thing he said about his mom, said he loved me and didn’t want to break up. In order to keep myself safe I kept him sweet and I agreed to stay together; he had calmed right down by then and I felt relieved.  Long story short I’m still with him. He said he wants to come to see me later and make things up to me. He said he will buy us takeout and we will have a nice evening together. I don’t know why he is so intent on wanting to stay in such an awful relationship. He tells me I’m a complete pain in the ass all the time and how he’s had enough of me so why the hell wont he just let me go. TDLR: tried to break up with my boyfriend but he turned nasty ","You're in an abusive relationship. That is why the relationship has felt bad and toxic. This is why he wants to stay with you even thought he calls you terrible names.  A common feature of abusive relationships is the abuser escalates when the victim tries to leave the relationship. He escalated yesterday - he held you hostage in his home and abused you until you agreed to stay with him.  This is really concerning behaviour. You need to end this relationship and get away from him. Please reach out to your friends and family for support, and read the book 'Why Does He Do That?' by Lundy Bancroft. He might escalate further into threats of violence and stalking when he realises you are serious about not being with him and you need to have your friends/family there for you. ",5267
9mjhkw,"[Link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6cjph9/how_do_i_26f_tell_my_husband_31m_im_addicted_to/) I've been sober since May 22, 2017 :) It's been almost a year and a half since I posted, I was a mess that day and really overwhelmed. You all gave me the push I needed to gather my courage and tell my husband about my drug use, **thank you so much for that**. I mean it, I knew he needed to know but I couldn't make myself follow through until I received encouragement a bunch of internet strangers. I hate to think what might have happened had I continued hiding it from him. My husband has been supportive, compassionate, and kind throughout my recovery. I wouldn't be doing so well today without him, there aren't words to express how much I love him and how grateful I am to be married to such a good man. With the help of my therapist I was able to open up to him about being raped (it was a violent, ugly, all around horrible incident) and the effect PTSD has had on me (it's an explanation, not an excuse, for the drug use).  We've had to work on rebuilding trust and I realize that's going to take time. He still prefers I stay home most of the time and he has reservations about new friends- both are totally reasonable in my opinion. I understand his feelings completely. We do more together now and I feel more included in his life, which has really helped my mental health. Every day I do my best to prove my love, appreciation, and respect for him. We're both continually putting effort into ourselves and our marriage. As for my recovery, I honestly feel a little weird calling it that. I didn't use long term and didn't face many of the same challenges as other addicts. But I am an addict, I'm always aware of that and I realize I'm no different fundamentally from someone doing heroin on the streets. Drugs were a distraction and a way to escape bad memories and nightmares. They were also part of my social life as my only friend in the area (at that time) used them too. Once I accepted that I had, and will always have, PTSD and began getting proper treatment I didn't want anything to do with drugs. I'm extremely lucky and thankful I stopped when I did. Dealing with my mental health hasn't been easy. Last August I went to a behavioral health hospital for six days. I didn't want to go at first but my husband and therapist convinced me I needed to- they were right. I felt much better afterward and I met a few people like me while I was there, it made me feel better to know I wasn't alone. People can say that you aren't alone all the time but it's different when you actually experience it. My husband and I went to couples' therapy for 3 months. It helped us quite a bit, we realized we needed to talk about things that hadn't occurred to either of us before sitting down with a therapist. It helped me understand his feelings and how my drug use (and concealing it from him) affected him. It helped him understand why I did what I did. It gave us a safe place to talk and that eventually led to better communication in private. I'm still seeing a therapist twice a month and attend group therapy once a month. I'm stable, healthy, and happy. I love my life and I'm really excited about the future. We're expecting a baby in the Spring and I can't wait to be a mom. I'm so looking forward to raising a family with my husband. Life is good. :) Thanks again, /r/relationships  **TL;DR**: I've been sober since May 22, 2017. My husband and I are doing well, we're happy and very much in love. He's supported me and loved me through this process. We've had a few struggles along the way but we work through things as they come up and move forward. I'm continuing to receive treatment for my mental health and I feel stronger than I ever have. I've learned I can't hide from my problems and now that I've received the appropriate treatment for PTSD I don't want to hide from it anymore. I'm finally happy and excited about my life and my future.","Well done OP :) Thank you for sharing this update too, it's important for people to see that things can get better.",721
9mv737,"Link to OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mql7n/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_of_10_months_is_best_friends/  I wrote my previous post over a year ago, and a lot has happened since then. I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.  For a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.  Things got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.  While I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship.    I didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.   As of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.     TLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend. He ended his friendship/partnership with his ex and we have gotten back together.",Wow. Good for both of you that the communication ended up working and you're happy together now. Congrats and hope it works out.,2225
9pjl0z,"Together for 5 years now, first year married. We bought our first house 2 years ago and are currently in the market for something larger. We're in no rush and are waiting for the perfect house. Yesterday our realtor showed us a listing for a house that my wife absolutely fell in love with. It's a house I've actually been in before and it is **really** nice. I work as a community nurse and one of my palliative patients from a few months ago lived in this house. While the house does check all of my boxes off too I fear that living in it will constantly remind me of my work in that house. Drawing up meds, doing assessments, rushing over to their house at midnight multiple times after they called my pager frantically, calling 911 during an emergency situation , and eventually returning to pronounce the patient's death all over the span of a couple months.  My wife thinks that I'm just being silly and once we move in, renovate, and make it our own I won't feel that way anymore. I strongly disagree. I've been doing my job for 4 years now and while you certainly become ""desensitized"" to the work there's still certain cases and patients who stand out.. and this was absolutely one of them. The house checks literally all of our boxes (under our price range, perfect size, large property, and ideal neighborhood) so she's really insistent. I don't even want to go for a viewing of the house.   **TL;DR:** Wife fell in love with a house. I'm not interested because I had a palliative patient who lived there. Am I being unreasonable?  **EDIT:** It wasn't a traumatic event for me. I specialize in palliative care and this was an expected death in the home. I've lost count on the number of patient's that I've pronounced or help stay comfortable during their last days and weeks - it's something I do at my job daily. That said - I still don't find it comfortable purchasing this house because of the history. I don't want to come home to somewhere that I used to work.   ","We bought a house that I knew as well.  I was friends with the previous owners and was in the house a lot.  Mind you it wasn't a traumatic experience but I strongly associated the house with the previous owners and felt like a permanent guest in someone's home at the beginning.  But then we renovated, painted everything, and moved in our own furniture.  And instantly it was my house.  I don't even think of the previous owners anymore.  The transformation was surprising and within a few weeks.  I think your wife is right.  You can make the house your own.",5351

He was really chill and empathetic about it. He invited me out to drinks later that week and since, well, everything was already known it was actually pretty easy to talk to him about it, and we laughed it off. I let him know I was still into him but wanted to give him space and also didn't want to complicate our friendship. He was very kind and affirming about it. &#x200B; Later that night, he asked if I wanted to kiss and I say said hell yes, so we made out a bit - it was amazing. We made plans to hang out later that week and one thing led to another and we did the monster mash. It was a graveyard smash. :) Our friendship seems to have deepened a bit as a result and I'm super happy with the FWB arrangement. I'm doubtful that the future will hold any further romance between us other than physical, but honestly I'm pretty happy with it? &#x200B; My sister and I also talked it out and everything is good between us now - she apologized, agreed to start therapy (recognizing the pattern of her going after people I like) and has been checking in with me to make sure I'm okay. &#x200B; TL;DR: Everything is cool, I'm banging my hot crush, we're still friends, my sister and I are cool, communication wins.","Glad things worked out for you. You mentioned he's your crush but now you're in a FWB arrangement while he's on rebound, just be sure you stay clear-headed about the FWB fact and keep your crushy feelings in check if he ultimately doesn't plan pursuing an emotionally invested relationship with you.",1981

I asked him out over email. I translated ""Will you go out with me? I really like you"" into unicode. He responded (also in unicode) that he would and also sent some ASCII art.

9qrxn7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9oqcoa/18_m_my_parents_found_out_i_have_a_girlfriend_18/ My parents recently gave me an ultimatum - break up with my girlfriend or face them turning their backs on me, prompting me to drop out of university. They are very conservative and religious (Christians) and they said I should only date when I'm done with school. Growing up I wasn't allowed to date at all. Prior my first girlfriend, I had only kissed one girl. My parents have always been very strict and unrelenting in what they think is right and what they think is wrong. Sex before marriage for them is an absolute no no. I come from Kenya but studying for my BA in England.  My parents found out I had a girlfriend due to Facebook - yeah, I learned from that mistake, big time - and they flipped. My dad called me and told me to break it off, or else they would stop paying for my BA and I'd be forced to drop out and come home. Initially, my plan was just to lie them - they are thousands of miles of away and with me being much more savvy with FB privacy settings in the aftermath of what happened, the chances of them finding out I was still with my girl were slim. However, that didn't come to pass because I got very pissed off by what my dad demanded of me. He required "" physical proof"" that the relationship was over. Over the weekend, he called and demanded that my girlfriend should record a video of herself, saying it was over.  I'm a shy, reserved person who has always been obedient to my parents. But for the first time in my life, I stood up for myself. I've never spoken back to my parents before but on that day, I did. I told my dad that he wasn't living in the same universe as everyone else and that there was no way I would humiliate and degrade my girlfriend in such a manner. That such a proposal was insane. He then started screaming and shouting at me (characteristically so). I cut the line. He tried calling again - I answered and he continued shouting. I told him I wouldn't talk to him until he started acting in a civil manner. I hung up again and didn't respond to his calls. He then sent me a string of angry messages, saying he will stop paying for my tuition and that I'm not his son anymore. My mum called me a few hours later and she imitated my dad's angry rhetoric. But I calmed her down and we spoke. I told her that I absolutely love her and my dad, and that I'm grateful for everything they have done for me in life.  But I stressed the fact that I'm 18, I'm a man living in a completely new country, absorbing a completely new culture and making my own way in life. And that I'm old enough to have a girlfriend. I told her my girlfriend makes me happier than I've ever been, that she got me out of isolating myself in my room during those first weeks, when I was too shy to meet new people and make new friends. She continued to object, and went to the extreme justification of her reservations - pregnancy. Going so far as asking whether we had slept together! I told her that respectfully, it's none of her business.  After that she hung up on me. I didn't hear from my parents until yesterday. It was my mum. She said she and my dad will continue paying for my tuition, but that they are very disappointed in me and  they regret sending me off to Europe to study - that it was better for me to go to a Kenyan uni. She added they raised me to be a better man and that the path I'm going down isn't right. I was planning to go to Kenya for the Christmas break but with the way things are, I don't think I will. My older sister lives in Seattle and she said I'm welcome to stay with her over the Christmas break. But that will probably be too expensive of a proposition for me. My girlfriend is Norwegian and she said she would love it if I spent Christmas with her and her family back in Norway. Her parents would be cool with it. Norway is a much more realistic destination for me. It's much closer than the States and thus much cheaper. **tl;dr** I'm not gonna lie, I kinda feel bad. I mean I'm happy that I stood up to them and it was such a relief. However, some of the things my parents wrote and said kinda stung. Was I wrong in my approach with them? And how should I approach them regarding our relationship, in the future?","Hey, as someone who grew up with really strict, conservative parents... I'm really proud of you. Standing up to parents isn't easy, especially when they steamroll you with demands and ultimatums and yelling. The fact that you got your protests in and did it with civility and class (seriously, when you told mom that you and your girlfriends' intimate affairs was none of her business I nearly cheered) is great and I'm glad that it worked out, more or less, in the end. I hope your study abroad goes well, and I hope things with your girlfriend do too!",4896
9rknqb,"My GF and I have been together for about a year. Most everything is great except one thing: If I tell her I'm sick/not feeling well/hurt she refuses to believe me. If I have a cold, she tells me I'm faking it until it goes away and then says ""see, you are fine!"" I'm rarely sick, so it's never been a major issue. But, she has zero sympathy when I'm sick.  She grew up with hypochondriac parents who were always ""sick"" with something, often self-diagnosing themselves with fatal maladies. She has limited contact with them and the time I met them, I was told (by them) that ""they didn't have long left to live."" I get it, growing up in that household must have been awful. But, what happened on Sunday just sent me over the edge.  GF and my sister [29/F] wanted to check-out this event and we were all supposed to go. I woke up with excruciating back pain and could barely breathe. GF got so mad at me for ""ruining this"" that she wouldn't speak to me. As she was about to leave I asked her not to leave because I thought something was wrong. She said no and left. I threw up in my bed and eventually called my parents (I was too embarrassed to call 9-1-1) and my mother and brother hauled me to the hospital.  I was whisked back and after ~20 minutes I was diagnosed with kidney stones. Fentanyl and gravol and I had a CT scan and then went for a procedure to bust the kidney stones. (Anyone questioning whether or not to have the procedure: DO IT. The side effects are nothing).  5 hours later and I was laying on my parent's sofa in a haze. I have never, and hope to never, feel pain like that again in my life. I was sure I was going to die. The attending in the ER told me it's worse than child birth and that they've had it before, too.  I didn't text my GF throughout because I really didn't have the strength or foresight. I was drugged up and uncomfortable. My sister found out that I had been in the emergency room and soon after my GF called me. She was pissed off I didn't call her. Then I reminded her that I begged her not to leave as I thought something was wrong. She got quiet and eked out an apology. I got furious and said something rather nasty things.. among them ""f-off"" and some other unsavory things.  In fairness, I was on dope, still sore, peeing blood and felt like someone had punched me in the gut. Standing was incredibly painful. I needed to take two days off of work & school, I rested in bed and the only thing you can think is ""the person who should have been there didn't even believe me.""  She's texted me this week a formal apology and wants one in return for saying nasty things to her. I've been avoiding her texts/calls. I've felt like shit this week and picked something up in the ER so I laid low, took a few days off work and relaxed. She wants to meet tonight and talk about everything, but I'm still so mad I don't know if I should hold off seeing her.  Is this as big a transgression as I feel like it is? Am I blowing this out of proportion because I felt so shitty?  I just am so annoyed and angry.  tl;dr GF didn't believe me something was wrong and I wound up in the ER with kidney stones and needed a procedure. She was mad that I didn't call her (I was too doped up) and then when I blew up at her she felt bad. I'm still mad at her. Am I blowing this out of proportion?","I’d have to real hard time getting past this. And even if I did, I’d be worried that I’d have to deal with her nonsensical bullshit every time I got sick. Who wants to deal with guilting and doubt on top of feeling physically sick? For fuck sake it sounds like you have to be hospitalized for her to believe you? She can kick rocks. ",5263
9ti2nf,"My original post was just over a year ago, and it's finally time for an update. Link to original: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/70q1an/my_29m_former_fwb_25f_claims_to_be_pregnant_feel/ Original tl;dr: Former FWB who lives in a different country says she's pregnant and keeping the kid. Don't know what to do. Advice please. At the time, lots of you saw many red flags that I didn't and you were pretty sure she wasn't actually pregnant. You were right, she wasn't! After telling her I'd only continue talking to her when there was a paternity test, she initially agreed. She then made up more stories about hospital visits, problems with the pregnancy and got angry that I wasn't being supportive. I held my ground and told her I wouldn't communicate further until the paternity test was done. About a week later, she finally admitted it - it had all been a lie to get my attention. I sent her a message asking her to get help and never contact me again. Blocked her everywhere. That was over a year ago, and I've had occasional messages (from other numbers) since then, either asking for forgiveness or getting angry with me for not offering forgiveness. I generally ignored them, though she did get in my head once by sending a message that she was so worried she'd damaged me and I replied telling her that I'd moved on and forgave her.  About 2 months ago, she text saying she was visiting the city I live in and wanted to meet up for a chat. I ignored it and blocked the number. Didn't think much of it. Then, 1 month ago, while I was on holiday, the receptionist at my work sent me a text. Someone had enrolled in a course in the where I teach who was asking about me. 27-year-old Russian. Holy shit, it was her! I had to tell my manager the story and she agreed to me taking some extra holiday and working remotely to avoid any unpleasant situation.  I received a few texts from her, telling me she had enrolled in that school by coincidence (no chance) and finally one to 'congratulate me on avoiding my idea of hell'. Her course finished last week and I found out from some social media stalking that she's now in another city. I think (hope!) that's the end of the story. Thanks for the help reddit. tl;dr My ex wasn't pregnant. One year later she travelled to my city and enrolled in a course to try to see me. I managed to avoid her and it seems like it's finally over.","This is actually stalker behaviour. I hope you haven't responded to her since you've said you forgave her. I hope you've blocked her number everywhere. And when you get texts from random numbers that are clearly her, take a photograph, block and move on. The photographs will come in handy if you ever need to get a restraining order against her. I doubt that this is gonna be the last of her bullshit. She came all the way over from Russia to see you and enrolled on a course where you teach. Depending on what kind of school this is, she could do this again and again. (But that also depends on any visa she holds - that's an area I really don't know a lot about). Make sure all your doors and windows are secure at night and don't hesitate to call the police if she tries anything. I'm sorry dude but I really doubt this is over. But since she's Russian, she'll have to go back to her own country eventually. Just be wary until then.",2068
9vjxrb,"I live alone in a city and I've had some trouble making friends. I go to the same cafe every day and the owners have taken on almost a parental role since my family is so far away. I'm close with them and I trust them and they care about my wellbeing, so when one of the owners, Sara, gave me the number of another regular, Derek, I trusted her judgment. I know Derek a little bit from spending time in the cafe. It's a small place and we both sit at the counter so we can chat with the owners. Usually, we sit next to each other. We've chatted about movies, he once helped me with my language homework, and he's generally in the cafe hanging out most afternoons. Sometimes reading, sometimes working on his computer. He's also friends with the owners of the cafe and has always seemed like a nice person so I certainly wasn't against getting to know him better. When Sara gave me his number yesterday, she was selling him pretty hard. I asked her about the book she was reading and she said, ""Derek lent it to me!"" and when I asked about a card game she said, ""Derek taught it to me!"". So I said, ""okay, I get it. I'll text him."" I texted Derek after I left the cafe and I thought it was maybe a bad idea because if things went south, it would be uncomfortable to see him in the cafe almost every day. But it seemed like Derek had already set things in motion by asking Sara to slip me his phone number in the first place. Derek told me that he could use more friends in the neighborhood and that he'd like to get to know me outside of the cafe, so we went out for a few beers. So, last night I learned that Derek is 31, unemployed, and he sees dead people. He's a full-on weirdo, which is fine. I still had fun hanging out with him and I didn't feel unsafe or threatened until I got home. In the 10 minutes it took for me to get into my apartment and get ready for bed, Derek sent me about 20 messages about how he wanted to kiss me and asking if he could come upstairs. I told him ""no, thank you for a fun evening. good night."" and went to bed. My phone died overnight and when I woke up and plugged it in, he had sent me more messages confronting me about blocking his number, which I didn't do. These messages were over the top and intense and honestly, they worry me a bit. It's obvious to me that I need to back away from this person, but right now I have no idea how to do that gracefully. I wouldn't mind a friendship, but he's made it clear that he's interested in a romantic relationship. I just want to be able to get coffee and enjoy myself without any awkwardness. What can I do? What should I say to Derek? And should I tell Sara that this guy freaked me out? TL;DR: I went out with a regular at my local cafe and it didn't go well. He's maybe a little unhinged. I don't want to lose my favorite coffee shop. How do I handle this without any awkwardness? Update: Thank you for your advice! I just went to have some coffee and talk with Sara. I didn't tell her everything but I told her I found Derek a little strange and she asked me what happened and I told her what he said about seeing ghosts. I mentioned in one of my comments that Sara shares some of Derek's interests in spirituality and mindfulness. We talked a little more about this. she's a very open-minded person. Sara knows that Derek believes he sees and hears ghosts and said she wasn't sure if it was true but she didn't believe he was deranged. I probably misunderstood some of what he was telling me about seeing dead people because we weren't speaking English. She asked me overall how I felt the date went and I told her that he was getting pretty intense, he's too old for me, and I'm feeling a little uncomfortable. She told me that she thinks Derek is a good boy but agreed that he can be a little over the top and told me to let her know if he did anything else that made me uncomfortable.","Screenshot the texts, tell Sara about your date (and your reservations about his mental well-being), and show her the screenshots. She is the owner, she has the right to refuse service if she feels someone is a threat to other customers. You also say they have a ""parental"" role to you; someone in that role would likely want to protect you. Don't blame her for setting you up (it doesn't sound like you took much convincing, so his facade of normalcy must be pretty good), and don't demand she ban him from the store, but explain that you aren't comfortable around him and let her take the lead and see what she does. As for Derek, block him. Don't try to be his friend after he has already harassed you.",3016
9vrxi5,"I'm kind of a moron sometimes when it comes to being aware of my wife's sensitivities. But I love her so much, and she loves me, so it's seriously bothering me that I screwed up. She is the best wife a man could ask for. We've been married for 4 years. She gave birth to our second child a few months ago. As you would expect we've been quite emotionally attached to one another during her pregnancy and after she gave me our second son, but when I offended her a week ago she has sulked and ignored me as much as possible. I rush home from work like I have been doing, eager to see my wife and our sons, but now she says ""you're dinner's on the table"" and she leaves me alone to eat while playing with our son and holding the baby. We've always had a ritual that has been extremely important to me: I get home from work and we make out for about 5 minutes, act all lovey-dovey, then we eat together with the boy(s). It's been devastating for her to abruptly change like this. So here's the stupid thing I did. When we married she was very skinny/petite, it was just her natural body type (and she exercised a lot). Since having the first child she has steadily gained weight and become a little plump. Her body definitely has changed and she's not looking skinny and petite. But she's still just as beautiful and this has never been something I've seen in a negative light. But this was apparently devastating to her self-esteem, to an extent that I wouldn't have imagined. I've always told her when we're intimate or she's getting changed near me that she's so beautiful. In fact as she's gained some weight I've said it more and I can sometimes barely keep my hands off her when we're alone and she's changing or something. Yet she's always responded to this by saying ""she's gotten so fat"", ""I'm hideous"", ""I'm sure not what you signed up for am I"", and all that crap. One night I said the wrong thing (though I didn't know it would be when I said it): I kissed her thighs and said ""your curves have gotten so amazing"" and she just flipped out and started crying, saying ""so now you're just acknowledging how fat I've gotten out loud"" and she's been seeming sulky ever since. When I told her that she's not ""fat"", that she's just as beautiful as before and actually more so, she just gets more upset. How do I fix this stupid mistake I made? I love my wife more than anything, and she's never gotten this upset or sulky before. &#x200B; **tl;dr My wife has gained some weight since having our 2 kids. I didn't realize how serious it was to her, and I commented about how ""sexy her curves have gotten"". She flipped out, cried, said that now I'm finally telling her ""how fat she's gotten while giving me 2 sons"". My life revolves around my wife, our daily affectionate rituals are gone, and she sulks a lot. I don't know how to fix it and make it up to her when she's so hurt and upset over this.**","This is definitely a self esteem issue. You can't say or do anything to fix it because she is telling herself she is fat. All you did was say something that she was able to use to justify her self hate. You can tell her until you are blue in the face that she is beautiful and desirable, but if she doesn't believe it, she won't hear you. It could actually be a little bit of post partum depression. Have a real sit down chat with her. Ask her to sit down with you and discuss her body issues with you and tell her it concerns you that she is so hard on herself. If she exercised a lot before, she may have always had this complex and being pregnant took that control away from her. Counseling may be in order here. ",6480

They were there for about 4 or 5 months, while my brother finished high school and during the summer I got to help them move into a place rented out by an old friend of my mom's for a lot cheaper than what the rent usually is for the area. But he started to get weird and moved friend into the backyard (he lived on the property as well) and then decided to rent the place out to someone else after my mom was living there for about 3 months. Finally my mom found out a family member had a duplex for rent and she's moved in there. All while this was happening my grandfather decided that being a jerk to my mom would somehow help her? He was unsupportive of my mom from the start and blamed her for getting kicked out. He tried to get us to move into his and my grandmother's place for a few months but as soon as we started moving stuff in he would make snide comments about how he didn't expect us to move stuff in (which is a lie, him and my grandma talked about it multiple times), and was just a jerk the entire time. So that's when my mom asked her old friend for help instead of moving in with her parents. Ever since, my mom has tried to contact him by wishing him happy birthdays, etc and he won't respond. It has gotten so bad that I finally snapped last month and laid into him, now he won't respond to me and says my mom has brainwashed us. So Thanksgiving should be interesting this year haha. I haven't heard from my mom's ex boyfriend and don't care to. We heard he is seeing someone else and has been for a few months but will try to still text or call my mom. My mom is cordial with him since she still cares about him but she is enjoying focusing on herself and getting to explore what she likes to do again. My mom is doing well. She has had some crazy stuff besides getting kicked out happen to her. She had a sort of skin cancer (not dangerous but still scared us until we knew what it was), her friend died, our cat that we have had for 17 years died, and now she has to have back surgery. But with finally being in a place where she can stay for as long as she wants, she's excited. She has been talking about starting online school after her back surgery and my brother is staying with her for awhile so they can both save up. As for myself, it's been rough but I realized I needed to seek some help feeling so overwhelmed. So I'm seeing a therapist and making sure to take care of myself while still being there for my family. My original post was a lot of me freaking out but everyone is doing well despite all the bad circumstances. &#x200B; Thank you to all the people who commented or offered advice. I appreciate it! &#x200B; TL;DR: Mom and brother bounced around a little but have finally found a place they can afford and stay for as long as they want. Mom has had some health issues but now that she's found a place she's getting those taken care of and is working on doing things she's wanted to do for awhile (schooling, new job, and dating again). Grandfather is jerk to his own family and has tried to be even more of a jerk while his family is struggling. But we are all doing well and trying to destress after all of this lol","I'm glad your mom got a good living situation.  She really dodged a bullet by nope-ing out of your grandfather's place.  It would have been hell for her and would have really gotten her down mentally.  I'm glad you're getting help too, it's always good to get outside perspectives on how to balance being good to others and still being good to yourself.  It can be easy to overextend yourself which is okay during a short-lived emergency but not so okay long-term.  ",470

We broke up. In my original, I stated that our relationship was otherwise 'fine', but I see now that I had been deluding myself. My boyfriend never treated me right, and used me more like a mother (did all cleaning, cooking and organising... yes, I made his doctor's appointments). One of the few times he could bring himself to have sex with me, my period started unexpectedly (*really* unexpectedly, as my implant meant I hadn't bled in two years!!) and he continued to bring up how 'disgusted' by me he was for months afterwards and used it as a reason that he couldn't have sex with me. So what was the real reason for the abstinence? He was cheating, of course! Found that out after he got stupid drunk at my mother's house, puked everywhere (I cleaned it up) and I tucked him in bed and put his phone on charge... which made the screen light up, and there was a text from her. I got the hell out of dodge and moved in with one of my best friends and his girlfriend. Now, I'm happy to report that after some dark months of dealing with my first real, painful break-up, my life has been moving in an upward trajectory! I found a much better job, my social life isn't confined to the friends of my partner who hate me, and I have a boyfriend of 9 months who never lets me doubt that he loves me. Guys, he can cook and clean and I don't have to call his doctor or mobile provider. I am so happy. Please, if you feel like you aren't being loved and respected in your relationship, GET OUT OF THERE!! I guarantee someone out there will treat you like a human being!! Thank you to the few who commented, it made me feel better about a shitty situation at the time. Oh, and my current squeeze never lets me go more than a few days without some lovin', so that got better too ;) **TL;DR** he cheated and it sucked, but not really because he was an awful partner in hindsight. new man much better and my life is more fulfilled :)",I'm very happy for you. You learned an important lesson earlier in life than a lot of women I know. Congratulations on not wasting more time on an unfulfilling relationship. I think very often all you need to do to be happier is lose the dead weight and make space for the good stuff.   Keep on keeping on :),544
9yhlte,"Hi everyone, so a few days ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9xoy6k/this_girl_early_20sf_in_is_tearing_our_dnd_group/?sort=confidence) about this girl (Sam) in my DND group who everyone has a crush on, and how it's causing a lot of my friends to turn on me cuz they think she has a crush on me. &#x200B; TL;DR at the bottom. &#x200B; So I wanted to thank everyone for all the great advice I got, and it led me to take some action over the weekend. So on Sunday (yesterday), I was txting with Sam and I decided to bring up and ask her how she was feeling about our gaming group. She confessed to me that she's been feeling really stressed out lately because she feels that Jake and Dave (our DM) have really been ostracizing her, because she's been getting closer to me. She told me that Dave would send her private angry or rude messages, saying mean things about me to her behind my back. I was shocked and honestly kind of defeated to hear how these guys who I thought were my friends treated me behind my back. She said she was so cut up about this and that she didn't want to come to DND anymore because she didn't feel like it's any fun anymore, and that hurt me the most, having her lose something she loves because of some dumb guys. &#x200B; So, based on the advice I got here on my last post, I did two things after getting this knowledge. I called up Dave, and told him that he either needs to grow up, and treat her with the respect she deserves, or she will leave the group. He was backpedaling, but eventually came clean that he has a thing for her as well and was just jealous of the attention I was receiving from her. He said that it's not her fault and it's not my fault and it's just something he needs to work through on his own, so at least he was able to be cognizant of that. The second thing I did was talk to Sam frankly about us and our relationship. I told her that I really liked her, and asked her if she liked me as well, which she said she really did, and had for a while now (which made my heart want to explode out of my chest). I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, even with all this drama going on, and I told her that I was on her side and would support her whatever she wanted to do with our gaming group. In the end, we've decided that we are dating now and we'll both be taking a break from DND for a few sessions before we go back and tell everyone. I am just so happy to have her in my life, and if my friends can't get over the fact that we're dating, she and I will start a new DND group with people who can be adults about it. &#x200B; Anyway, thank you all for your help, and I'm glad I bit the bullet, I couldn't be happier right now! &#x200B; **TL;DR: I asked the girl out, she said yes we're dating now :) I called out our DM on his BS and he apologized and said he would cut it out. Looking forward to brighter DND days with my girlfriend!** &#x200B; **EDIT: 1.2K?? I never expected this to blow up so much! Thank you again, everyone, for your kind words, thoughts, anecdotes, and advice. I've talked to Dave again today actually and told him that Sam and I were officially together and we want to be able to come back and play all together again, but my respect for Sam's feelings overcomes my want to continue playing with them. Dave told me that he was really sorry for being such an ass before and that he is happy for Sam and I and doesn't want this to come between our friendship. I am hopeful that we can move past this! Also -- to those who suggested Sam invite a female friend to our group, she reached out to one of her best friends from high school who still lives in the area, and she is interested in joining! I think Sam will feel more comfortable, and it'll take some of the spotlight off our new relationship if we invite a new player into our group. Anyway, wanted to update and thank everyone again for all your kind comments.** ","That’s awesome!! My husband and I just  started playing D&D together a few months ago and love it!  Sorry your group got stupid, but hopefully now that you are a couple, they’ll get over themselves.  Maybe not playing characters that are a “couple” also will help keep them more friendly. And if not, I hope you guys find another group of good people. Maybe more couples... haha. ",2469
9ysdlt,"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8547ag/my_boyfriend_25m_cannot_handle_being_alone_when_i/).  It's been eight months, and I thought I'd give an update.  First of all, we're still together. The advice was overwhelmingly along the lines of ""this is a major problem and will not go away"" - and I agreed with it at the time. However, after posting, I decided to wait a bit just to see how things went because I really liked the guy.  There are a couple of things that affected his behaviour that I didn't really understand before:  * He is not fulfilled by his work, and so any time not spent in work is really important to him and he wants to make the most of it * Most of his close friends are big drinkers, and he was trying to cut back. This meant that he was not seeing his friends as often as all they do is go out on the weekend together.   These two things together meant that he was alone a lot more than he used to be and he was feeling frustrated in general. So here's what has happened since:  Over the summer, I wasn't in classes anymore and we spent a lot of time together. This sort of goes against intuition, as I thought more time apart would be better. But there are a lot of days when I don't feel like doing anything, so if he wanted to spend time with me, that meant that he had to come up with something to do while I was reading or sewing or doing whatever on my own. He got comfortable with watching something or reading something while I was sitting there doing my own thing.  He figured out how to hang out with his friends without making it a big drinking night. They started going out to dinner once in a while. He would go out with them occasionally and just not drink as much and go home early. I think this really helped him not feel so alone.  He came to terms with how unfulfilling his job is and he's currently working to fix that. A few months ago, we started having some honest conversations about what he really wanted to do, and he was trying to figure that out for a while. Well now he has a solid plan of getting to that new career, and while it will take some time, he gets so excited just talking about it. I think this has helped tremendously.  Thanks to everyone who commented. I think everyone was exactly right that it was a pretty major problem, which is why I posted. I appreciate everyone telling me that though. Sometimes you need to hear that. I'm glad I gave it a chance to fix itself though. I honestly couldn't be happier in my relationship than I am now. tl;dr: boyfriend and I are still together, he's figured out to be alone, things are great.","This is a great update and I'm happy for you guys. This is also serving as a reminder to pretty much everybody not to neglect your own happiness and try too hard to derive it from a relationship. We all need to function outside relationships, and have our own goals, hobbies, friends etc. I know I myself can get so wrapped up in new love that I forget what I used to enjoy on my own before.",1613

I had a lot to think about and consider. Two days before Thanksgiving I decided to ask my mom if she knew what was going on with my sister. She told me that she just found out from the kids that my sister and her husband took off to another state for a last-minute vacation, without the kids. She didn’t tell anyone and left her kids pretty much alone. My parents live nearby and would have been happy to have them over. Apparently, my sister’s mother in law lives on the property in an RV with no electricity. Mother in law has schizophrenia and does not take her meds. I didn’t mention in my original post, but the kids are 16M and 15F, the older kid does not have a driver’s license. They also live out in the woods, a good distance from the closest town. At this point, I had decided not to invite her over.  The day before Thanksgiving, my dad called and told me that he believed my sister was under the impression that she was coming to my house with her family, even though I haven’t spoken to her. I told him that her husband was not welcome, and he said I needed to tell her because he didn’t want to stir up trouble. I didn’t want to call her because she was alone in another state with her husband and I didn’t want that to start a fight. My dad took it upon himself to call her and ask her directly what her plans were for Thanksgiving. She said she was coming to my house and he told her to call me first because there are issues. She never called me and told my mom later that night that she wasn’t coming home until after Thanksgiving. My mom invited both kids to my house for Thanksgiving. My nephew decided to go to his cousins (on his dad’s side), where there is absolutely no supervision. My sister and husband are apparently okay with this. Thankfully, my mom was able to get my niece to come with them to my house. I took the opportunity to spend some time alone with her. She opened up about her problems at home and asked for a lot of advice about college, jobs, etc. I told her she is always welcome in my home and invited her to spend some time with us on her Christmas break. I gave her my number and told her to text me anytime, especially if she needs a break from her home. I don’t know if she will take me up on my offer, but it’s there.  I’m pretty disappointed that my sister would leave her kids on Thanksgiving. Her daughter was hurt by this, but now she knows there is someone that will support her and be there if she needs it. All in all, we had an awesome, drama free Thanksgiving.   TL;DR: Did not invite my sister to Thanksgiving because of her abusive husband, but was able to give my niece a lifeline which might make all the difference. ",You need to call CPS and report all of this. Protect those kids. They don’t deserve it. ,2172
a0acid,"Hey all,  I made a post and got a ton of answers. It was pretty brutal but I appreciate every message and the advice. I tried to reply to each one and thank them, but it quickly became too hard. Thanks so much everyone. The link to my original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9xnqpo/my_31m_boss_35m_just_made_me_aware_im_not_well/  Anyway, to the update. I went to see my boss and another boss, one of which I wasn’t sure how she felt about me so figured it would be a good idea to ask someone I’m close to and someone I’m not to cover all the bases. It turns out it actually is just the two I’m aware of that don’t like me. However, it was also pointed out that while people do love my sense of humour, I need to be more aware around people who don’t know me because I do come across as condescending or rude.  I’ve gotten lots of great tips from you all, and from my bosses as to what to work on and how to be more appropriate at work. I’m going back to therapy this week as well. It was suggested by some Redditors that I don’t seem happy and maybe that was an issue. Turns out I’m still holding a lot of pain and defensiveness from a past abusive relationship so I’m working on that too.  It’s a long road ahead but I’m going to work hard to make it to where I can let go, be happy and learn how to better understand others and be more appropriate. I really appreciate the replies from everyone, so thanks again.  TL;DR - had a conversation with two of my bosses and discussed how to be more appropriate as well as figuring out how to work on the issues I have. Feeling more optimistic and already doing better with some colleagues.","While many people said that you are not socially aware (and they are not completely wrong), you are conscious enough about your surroundings that you not only went and asked for advice but also followed it. That is pretty good and better than a lot of other people can do. Give yourself a pat on the shoulder for that! I wish you all the best in your social endeavors :) It's an uphill climb for the best of us.",1944
a0g3v4,"Previous post here. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9x3n6l/i_32f_dont_know_how_to_handle_thanksgiving_with/ I got some really good advice about how to handle the first Thanksgiving after my husband passed, since I wanted to see his family as well as spend the day with my boyfriend Alan. So I knew how much it would mean to my late husband’s family for me to at least stop by their dinner, but I also didn’t want my boyfriend to feel awkward or pushed aside. I’m happy to say he was an absolute gem and dinner at my mom’s was great. We played some games and ate a lot, then Alan drove me to my late husband’s family’s dinner and dropped me off. I said hello to everyone and had a small plate (so much food!) then left after about an hour. My MIL was so happy to see me, and even though it was hard — she pulled me aside and cried a bit — I’m glad I went. While I visited, Alan drove around a local park and played Pokémon Go, haha. So he was happy when he came back to get me and he had hatched a few eggs in the meantime. The next day we got our Christmas tree. Communication with all parties wins again! Not a super exciting update but I’m glad I was able to make everyone happy and still have a good holiday myself. I know Christmas is going to be very hard but with the lovely, supportive people I’m lucky enough to know, I’ll be okay. Thanks again for your advice, all you kind folks! **TL;DR** Attended both Thanksgivings, boyfriend played Pokémon while I visited late husband’s family and everyone was happy so I was happy.","This makes me happy, I’m glad you’re happy :) ",871
a1ta8x,"So many through comments and PMs requested an update from my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9vlueu/i_29f_am_traveling_overseas_to_meet_my_online/) and so I thought I'd do one! After my post I FaceTimed him to say my what I wanted to say and end things. He tried to get me to post-pone my trip and even tried to give me money to make me less mad at him. I told him whatever we had was over as I could no longer trust him. He cried which made me feel weird. I wished him and his ex the best and ended the call.  I went on my trip and had a top class time. The Reddit community really astounds me sometimes. I received a lot of PMs of suggestions of things to do and see and the trip to Ireland became a trip of a lifetime. In Dublin I did meet up with a very kind Redditor who showed me around the city and came with me to a bunch of museums during my stay. I saw amazing sights, met a bunch of really cool people through my travels, and met a few really cute Irish boys. (; I learned a lot about myself on my first solo trip abroad. I am pretty self reliant and I did a lot of self reflection. This ""relationship"" was my first ""serious"" one after my ex and I split up. I think in my desire for closeness with someone I ignored a lot of red flags and downplayed my self worth. I am now focusing on making real connections with people I meet in real life and have decided to stay away from anything long distance indefinitely.  My first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) and he said he was sorry but it was what it had to be. It didn't really seem sincere and it extinguished any romantic notions I had.  Thank you to everyone who commented and PM'd me. It really made me excited for my trip and it was the best time! TLDR; Online BF backed out but after some logistical rearranging I still went on my trip and had the best time ever. Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.

a1ury1,"Hi Guys, I am back with awesome news!  tldr: We are engaged and everyone is doing better. My old post is here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9oeq0k/i_30m_was_planning_to_propose_to_my_girlfriend/  Okay so in my last post my girlfriend was being very aggressive towards me about not proposing before her father passed away. She stayed relatively upset and cold towards me throughout the funeral, but afterwards it seemed like we started to get closer. That week was honestly living hell, having to go to a man I truly cared for's funeral, while his daughter is mad because she thinks i'm not proposing, all the while I am but cant tell her right now. It sucked However, time went on and things started to get better. Two weeks after the funeral, early November, I talked to her Mom and she helped me develop a new plan. I had convinced my girlfriend to take the whole week of Thanksgiving off, which wasn't hard because she knew the first holiday without her father would be really hard. So I took her on a surprise trip (which was our original mountain trip just later). Our plan was to leave Sunday evening and return Wednesday in time to help her family prep for Thanksgiving. So I decided Sunday was my day. Her mom took her out all day to help her get ready for our little get away (aka distract her). I started setting up my proposal. I first took screenshots of all of the conversations her dad and I had via text about the engagement and printed them out. I was actually able to turn it into 15 individual screenshots of conversation. So I made them into a little book. I also included the picture I took with him the day I asked for his blessing and the two pictures i had of us three all together.  I packed our bags for the trip and decorated the house in flowers and balloons so she'd know something was up as soon as she opened the door. When she opened the door she looked shocked and a little confused. Even more confused when I handed her a book and didn't get down on one knee. I had initially intended to get down on one knee while she read through our conversations but she started crying pretty hard and took the book to the couch in the living room, where I just kind of scooped her up in a hug and asked her to marry me. I had to awkwardly fish the ring out of my pocket and we didn't have the magical getting down on one knee moment, but through her tears she shook her head yes and hugged me, which I thought was even better than expected.  Once she regained her composer she told me how excited she was, but asked if i would mind if we waited til Monday morning to go to the mountains because she wants to show her mom and brother the book and ring. I didn't care at all and we ended up spending the night at her moms house. We left Monday and had an amazing trip to the mountains and we tried to hit all of her dads suggested proposal spots while we were there and snap pics (even though the weather was a lot colder than when our initial trip was planned) We had an amazing Thanksgiving with our families and now we cannot wait to start wedding planning. She decided she no longer wants to get married next October and I obviously understood. Our wedding day is still TBD, but I couldn't be happier.","Awesome job OP. I love your idea for the book, I'm sure it must have meant a lot to her and her family. Best of luck planning the wedding and living your lives together!",1041

It really meant a lot that you guys agreed that there wasn’t something that was wrong on my end.  I met a couple of friends this past weekend from college and found out that my ex has been going around telling people about the nasty things he texted me. He apparently wrote a rap song too about me (should I feel honored or laugh at the time he wasted). I was really angry to begin with because I was still obviously hurt, but then I realized that this definitely would not have worked in the long term, and I’m glad he showed his true colors, even if it was almost 2 years into the relationship.  I’m also going to start therapy soon just to deal with how much emotional baggage he unloaded on me, as well as coping with my accident.  Once again, thank you everyone for your support!  Tl;dr: Ex has been going around saying more things and now I know I’ve made the right decision staying away! ",He must be a cringy person if he made a rap song about you. Yikes...,1468

So I’m posting it just in case even one person in a similar situation gets the moral boost they need. &#x200B; 2 years ago I was really struggling with both my mental and physical health. They both spiralled off each other (as invisible illnesses tend to do, unfortunately) and it was really hard for me to improve the home life situation that was definitely not helping matters. I love my grandparents to bits, and I’m very grateful for all the care they provided, but living in an isolated town in the middle of nowhere with only them for company made it very difficult to meet new people or do the few activities I’m still able to do. &#x200B; Moving to somewhere bigger and with a population closer to my age has definitely been a big factor in improved dating success. It sounds obvious, I know, but it’s not an easy thing to uproot when you’re disabled. But if you’re isolated and find it hard to meet people because there’s nothing to get out the house for, it’s such a boost in quality of life. Now there are places to go and do things/meet new people. There are actually people my own age there to meet! &#x200B; Meeting people in person also made it easier to have that conversation about my health more organically and casually; preferably after they’ve got to chat with me and know me a bit first too. Online dating works for some people, sure, but I think it’s way less stressful getting to know someone as a friend first and hang out in person without pressure instead of meeting up with a stranger and wondering whether you’ll even want to sit through the whole date (and stress is of course a health trigger). I know I certainly didn’t have the energy needed to sift through the numbers game that is online dating – I know some single friends who would have one good date for every ten or so dates through apps. &#x200B; I met my current boyfriend at a board games café. Somewhere I could get out, but that wasn’t too taxing (sitting down is a lot less taxing on my pain and fatigue than active sports for example). We got chatting, became friends pretty quickly. He was super oblivious to all my definitely-not-subtle flirting attempts, so at first I figured he just wasn’t interested (especially as he knew about my fibro). Turns out he was just very shy and not wanting to misread anything. &#x200B; We’ve talked about my health and he knows he can ask my any questions he wants about it. But honestly, he’s been really amazing and understanding about it in a way I never thought anyone would be. He pre-empts issues before they even have a chance to come up (noticing if the heating turns off too early and grabbing a blanket because he knows the cold makes me worse) and mentally plans out our time together around “Well if we do this on that day, we’ll have a chill day in the next day because you’ll be exhausted”. &#x200B; It’s still relatively early days, but I wanted to let fellow spoonies know that there are people out there who don’t freak out at health conditions. There are so many support groups and articles online from the perspective of dating/married life when you’re already together and get the diagnosis, so someone’s already invested and supportive. The amount of times I’ve heard “I don’t know how I’d cope without my partner” has been so demoralising as a single person who struggled to find anyone. &#x200B; So, for anyone who’s going through a hard time right now with their health, or struggling with being single – don’t give up! Do everything you can to create opportunities for you to meet new people, or even just leave the house with friends and ask them to invite some of their friends you haven’t met yet. It’s scary, yes, and it might be a narrower scope on what you’re physically able to leave the house and do, but even something low key like going to the library, a café, a book club, etc is a good place to start. &#x200B; Tl;dr: After struggling with dating since my diagnosis of fibromyalgia, I’ve successfully been in a relationship for a couple of months now and am super happy about it! &#x200B; Edit: Wow, this blew up so much more than I expected! I'm happy it's made an impact on so many people though, I'm getting so many lovely comments and messages :) I also got my first ever Reddit Gold, so thank you to whoever gifted that!

I got some great advice, I got a lot of tough love advice and some terrible advice. I know he was already committed by all of his actions and that I really needed to focus on college first before having to plan a wedding.  Well, it turned out my boyfriend at the time had been planning on proposing to me for a long time. He wanted to wait until I graduated college. A little after I graduated college, he took me on a hike. I knew this was a special hike because it was the same place we went for one of our earlier dates.  The first time we went on that date was magical. I always teased him that he never kissed me on the date. There was this perfect moment he was holding me in front of a beautiful picturesque lake as we were just enjoying each other's company in an embrace. I thought he was going to kiss me but he didn't.  I later kissed him first but always teased him that he didn't kiss me in that moment we had. He confessed he wasn't sure if I wanted to be kissed. He said he wanted to kiss me more than anything.  Well he took me back on the hike 4 years later, and when we got to that lake, he told me this is when he knew he was first in love with me. Then he got on one knee and proposed to me. I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! So he asked, ""Are you going to marry me or not?"" And I said of course. We got married about a year later and we just celebrated our one year anniversary in October.  I've never been happier and I'm so excited to continue our life together!

a4axp3,"I am conflicted, therefore, I wanted some help on what to do. I have looked up career possibilities as a “moving” military girl friend, maybe some day wife. My boy friend really wants me to go with him, but I don’t know if it’s the best thing for me, career wise. Currently, I’m in school, going for my bachelor’s degree. I only have two years left, and after that, I plan on getting into law school. He’s in the Air Force, stationed in Texas. Which he’s been here for about three years now. We have been together for 1 and a half. Knowing that he’s going “overseas”, it’s possible he’ll be stationed in different countries for a few years. What’s holding me back is my career. Law school isn’t meant to be jumping around from country to country without knowing where you’ll land permanently due to the bar exam. Also, we aren’t married and I don’t know if I should risk my career (which I’ve been very committed to being a lawyer) for a future that’s a bit warped. I did see that I can become a programmer and it’ll be versatile, but that’s not what I truly want to do. Sure, Hawaii seems amazing, but more of a 3 year long vacation with a questionable future. We both agreed that long distance wouldn’t work since I would be all the way in Texas. Is it bad that I want to go but don’t want to risk it all just to be put in a bad situation of misery? Also, if I do go, I’d have to transfer schools, and go to school in Hawaii. That’s already a very high tuition, that has to be paid by fasfa and student loans. Quite frankly, I’m also afraid that I won’t be able to sustain myself, separately from my boy friend’s income. I like to feel independent, and know that I can fend for myself. Maybe that’s a pride issue? I don’t know, but I do know it’s a high standard of living. That also adds to the jumble of thoughts. I will also admit, I am fairly close to my parents. In my Hispanic household, we have always been very united. I currently work with them in their small business because it benefits the both of us. I can go to school with a flexible schedule and still make good income and they have a stable employee. That’s something my boy friend never really knew growing up. He’s a Kansas boy, from a small town, with parents who split up when he was little. I feel like he doesn’t understand how hard it’ll hit my parents and I, being far away for three years. It also bothers them a bit that I’m not married but willing to leave not knowing what’ll happen in the relationship.  TL;DR: My boy friend is in the military and is being stationed in Hawaii. We have been together for one year and a half. We are currently In Texas. I want to go to law school, but moving around will be difficult. i’m trying to do what’s best for the both of us, what’ll benefit my career, how it’ll affect my parents and what’s the best choice since I’m not married, In the long run.  EDIT: I am very thankful for all the supportive responses. This generated more responses than I thought I’d get, and I’m speechless (in a good way). While, I couldn’t respond to all, I want to thank everyone who took time out of their day to help me out. I am very grateful. I will keep you guys posted. In a few months or so, I will come back and update on what I’ve decided. Also, to all the people who serve/served our country, thank you for your service. As well as military spouses/kids, for being strong and supporting the person you love. I really do have respect for you all. ",Never put a man before your career at your age. ESPECIALLY if you want to go to law school. This is coming from a law grad. ,3968
a54mgo,"The original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9du198/my_best_friend_20m_asked_me_20m_out_i_said_yes_i/ First of all, I wanted to thank people for responding. I was majorly panicking when I wrote the post, and the comments I got helped a ton to get me to relax before talking to Noah. I wasn't expecting such a huge response at the time and I was amazed, but looking back now I can see why it got so much attention. It was a pretty weird situation. Next, I want to say we are both men (apparently this makes a big difference for some people in terms of advice). Some of the people who assumed I was a woman also made some weird comments and sent me some pretty gross messages. If you did this, please stop. That's not cool. I gave a bit of an update as an edit to the original post, but now since it's been 3 months I thought I'd give you all an update about how things have been going since then, since it seems like there's been a bit of interest, and I'm still really thankful to all of you for helping me out. Noah is doing really well. I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P One of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals. About a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy. That was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out. I'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man. It sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update. TL;DR: So yeah, our relationship wasn't ruined and I still have my best friend. He's doing really well and I love seeing him so happy. Thanks again for the help!",What a lovely happy update - and I had to go back and check your ages because the maturity and self awareness you have both shown is pretty impressive. Big smile from this mom  Happy holidays!,1907

a67rsj,"I placed my son up for adoption almost 16 years ago. It was a decision I came to on my own but it did come with the added pressure of my mom specifically telling me I would no longer be her daughter if I choose to keep my baby. This was huge for me because I am an only child. It was the most difficult thing to do and I struggle with the emotions of it daily.  It was an open adoption and I have the ability to reach out and get pictures/updates whenever I like. I did that for a few years but then it just became easier to move on by not knowing. I knew I had made the right decision and the family taking my son was amazing.  I also ended up not speaking to my mother for six years after because of the way she treated me during my pregnancy. It took years of therapy and a lot of forgiveness to even be in the same room as her. I made peace with her for the sake of the rest of our family (i.e. cousins, aunts, grandma's).     At the same time my mothers health was deteriorating and I found out through some family she wasn't working, had divorced her second husband and was homeless living in her car.   I had moved away and was doing well enough financially. I succumbed to the guilt provided by my family and agreed to move her in with me and help her get the proper care. It wasn't ideal but I made it work. Got her healthy and got her into some housing and our relationship has been ok.  Fast forward to July of 2018. I had lost my job, and in general things weren't working in my favor. Mid-life crisis status but with all things I knew this too would pass and a year from now this would not matter.  I had a plan of action and knew things would get better I just needed time.  Things did get better, got a new job, moved to a new city, celebrated my birthday and on vacation until January 2nd. Things were great up until this morning.  I'm visiting out of town with some family, which includes my mother. My mom approached me about having issues with her computer/phone I paid for/bought and asked if I could help.  She handed them over and I started troubleshooting. As I'm going through I notice her computer has several tabs open and I start closing things and un-cluttering the mess. Next thing I see is an open email from August between the man who adopted my child and my mother. She is basically telling him how bad my life is because of her and her health issues and I lost my job and she needs to speak with him to ask for any kind of help. The last email is them exchanging phone numbers.   I'm beyond upset now and don't even know what to do or say going forward. I've locked myself in the bedroom and trying to wrap my head around this. Thanks for reading. tl;dr: mom went behind my back and contacted the family who adopted my son telling them how poorly I'm doing in life (which is not true) asking for money. ","Wow. Ok, so first of all, you should reach out to the couple that adopted your child and tell them that you just found out your mother reached out and was asking them for money.  Tell them you hope they didn't send her anything because this was done entirely without your knowledge, under false pretenses, and that they should never feel they have to give you OR your family any money, ever. Second, have it out with your mom.  She has some fucking nerve trying to capitalize on your pregnancy after how she treated you.  And all of her apologies are called completely into question now that you know she did this.  ",5243
a6g9dk,"Alright so I married my husband (37M) about 6 months ago. He had an 18 year old when he was 19 and was married to her mother for about 15 years. They got divorced and we get his kids (15F, and 8M) for 2 weeks and then their mother gets them for 2 weeks. The 18 year old (let's call her Brittany) lives with her (45M) boyfriend. I've had a really great relationship with all 3 kids. Once brittany started dating her current boyfriend who is 45, the relationship between her and my husband really started going sour. I dont support her decision but her and I remained close and I did my best not to isolate her. After Brittany and I started growing closer she started taking more and more advantage of me and my kindness. Her boyfriend doesnt make much money and she doesnt have a job. Her sisters birthday is tomorrow and a couple of weeks ago she mentioned a nice coat her sister wanted and asked me if I would just go look with her. We didnt have any luck at our local mall so I spent some time finding a nice coat on Amazon and asked Brittany if her sister would like it, she said yes and so I ordered it.  We dont get her sister on her actual birthday, but we are celebrating it today (1 day early). I had told brittany that the coat could be from the both of us, since I found it and paid for it but she did tell me the style/color her sister wanted. Then I get a text from Brittany saying that No, she wants to give it to her on her actual birthday and tell her mother she paid for it to prove that her and her boyfriend are successful. I told her I wasnt comfortable with that and I'm sorry but it's a group gift from us and for us, her birthday is today since she goes back to her mother's late tonight. I asked her to share her feelings and she said she is really angry at me and thinks I'm being selfish. I dont know how to respond to her. My husband currently has pneumonia which is why I'm turning to reddit and not him since he is really sick right now. I am new to being a step mom, and I'm really trying here. How do I respond to this?  Tldr: bought my 15F step daughter a present. My other step daughter wants to give it to her after she leaves our house and say she bought it. UPDATE: thank you so much for all of the advice! I truly am so grateful for all of it. Well last night my husband stayed home while I took my 15F stepdaughter and her little brother to dinner at her favorite restaraunt. I invited Brittany and she came with the 45M boyfriend. My 15F step daughter pulled me aside and asked if I invited him, I said no and she told me she really doesnt like him and if in the future we can ask him to not come. I told her I would have a conversation with her dad and her sister. After dinner we all came back to mine and my husbands home. It was pretty awkward, and when she opened the coat Brittany made sure to let her sister know that she picked it out and it was all her idea. I mostly just ignored it and enjoyed the birthday party. Later that night I went to drop off the kids with their mom. After the kids were inside their mom instantly said ""We need to have a conversation about Brittany's behavior."" And I had a great conversation with their mother about everything, since her behavior is affecting both households and the kids. I talked to my husband and he is going to talk to Brittany, and we also talked about my role in her life and read him lots of the comments from all of you. Yes, the boyfriend thing is terrible, and my husband agrees that he is a predator. I know some comments mentioned the divorce, but overall, the two daughters have expressed the marriage was bad. Their mother had a long affair and it was all just a mess, I appreciate the comments talking about divorce and parenting, but we have all attended classes (me, husband, and ex wife) on co-parenting and we all try really hard to make these kids happy and have a healthy life. I know it's a tough road to navigate, but I really appreciate brutal honesty, and advice. ","I cant get past the bf older than her dad. Yuck. That guy is a creep and she's a dummy.  That said, no, it's a group gift and that is that. Why should you have to scramble to find something else to give this girl? It is in no way your responsibility to make sure this daughter appears responsible in her mom's eyes (the bf and lack of job already prove she isn't. One gift wont change that.) I do agree with the other poster for giving her credit for picking out the gift. How to deal with her anger? Maybe say you're sorry you cant do more and end the discussion. She's 18, her brain isn't fully formed yet, she will get over it in time... or she won't, but you cant change it. If shes that type of person she would just find something else to mad at you for. Finally, try to make sure she's provided with birth control. This BF is bad news, the last thing they need is a pregnancy. ",1610
a6zard,"Me: 42M Wife: 42F We have been married for almost a year. Together for 3.  Scenario: Having dinner, eating & drinking wine. (Just one glass of wine not getting drunk) - her daughter (12) asks about her Ex boyfriend, as in what happened/why they broke up (more than 4 years ago) and my wife breaks down at the table, full on crying, gets up and leaves the table.  We are just stuck in slow motion at the table. Her daughter says ‘thought she would have been over that by now’ and I say the same.  We talk about it privately and she says that she was hurt by him and his betrayal. (He left her for another woman) - but 4 years ago, and I’m now married to her.  She says her episode was a result of the pain from the betrayal, not from feelings for him. I’m having a hard time with this as it seems like there are some left over feelings for him she isn’t telling me about. I’m feeling like maybe I’ll never live up to what they had together.  Her daughter isn’t biologically related to the ex-bf.  The energy in our house is very heavy.  Help.  Trying to get past it.  UPDATE: Just for clarity, he didn't cheat on her. He did betray her and did leave her for a good friend of hers. So yeah a bad situation. They were living together for 5 years. I am grateful for all those who have written in and given their thoughts. It helps a lot. Thank you. I will have a conversation with her about it and us moving past it. I believe her when she says she doesn't have feelings any longer for him. It was just hard last night when my head was spinning from that episode. So hard to see it that way. tl;dr - wife cried over ex-bf from 4 years ago in front of myself and her child.  Says it was because of the pain of betrayal, not feelings for him. ","When I found out my then-fiance was cheating on me, I threw up. I still have a very visceral reaction when I think about that time, now almost 9 years later. I am in a wonderful relationship now and have not a shred of positive emotion towards my ex. But the feelings were still very intense and still reverberate sometimes ",5582

She and her fiancé are now moving into our apartment building, and my boyfriend is seeing and talking to her more and more. I don't know if it's time to set boundaries or if I'm getting ahead of myself. &#x200B; A lot has happened since my last post, and I got some good advice there, so I wanted to post an update! After I made the last post I came home from the trip with my family a couple of days later. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable. My boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed. He set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Finally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year! It turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us. So communication saves the day again! We're all great friends now, and Liz and I have regular girls nights to plan our weddings together :) TL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend and he introduced me to Liz and her fiance right away. We're all great friends now and I'm no longer uncomfortable - but I am engaged! EDIT: Wow, wow, wow!!!! I know this is stereotypical, but I never expected my post to blow up like this. I started reading the comments last night and planned to reply to some but then I got busy, and then this just got out of control! So let me just say here, thank you all SO MUCH for the support, advice, and well-wishes! You guys rule  And thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver?! I’ve never gotten any of that before and now I’m a little sad that this is a throwaway and not my main, haha. I’ll pay it forward and gild someone today :)",Congrats on your engagement and I'm glad it all worked out!,2865

I told my husband, shortly after I posted the story here because I was feeling very anxious and he was going to pick up on that anyway. I don't think I have to say that my husband was livid, I never saw him like that before. After a lot of talking, I ended up learning a lot about the relationship between him and BIL. &#x200B; To keep things short, BIL is a huge asshole who has ruined relationships for my husband in the past. The only reason he didn't ruin ours was because my husband put a lot of distance between himself and his own family. His family by the way, always chalked it all up to sibling rivalry and never did anything to help, so I don't blame him. &#x200B; **What happened after:** My husband called BIL and asked him to not contact us anymore, he only wanted him to apologize to me for dragging me into this. BIL denied his request saying it was just a joke and I should be able to take one like a grown up. He hung up on us and that was that for a few days, until we received a call from my MIL who was very angry. BIL had told her and my FIL what had happened and that he was very upset that he couldn't even make jokes without my husband making a big deal out of it. So MIL was calling to say that we and my BIL's family weren't going to be invited to family gatherings anymore until everything was solved. &#x200B; I told my husband about the call and he was surprisingly calm this time around, saying that it was the usual behavior and that if I wanted to he would make an effort but he didn't care very much. At this point I was angry myself because I never saw this behavior in his family before and it was etremely frustrating. I told him not to bother and that it would be up to him to decide. We kept mostly to ourselves since and nobody reached out to us either. Until monday, when my FIL called us to say that BIL was invited to spend christmas with the family because his wife was pregnant. He only wanted to make sure that we knew this because he didn't want us showing up to ""ruin everyone's good time"". &#x200B; Me and my husband ended up laughing about it later because it was so absurd. But I noticed that it has taken a toll on my husband's mood and I'm debating suggesting therapy for him because I feel like there's a lot he doesn't feel comfortable telling me. We're going to spend christmas with my parents and I hope my husband will be able to tune out from this entire situation and have a good time. &#x200B; **TL;DR BIL said it was a joke but he was offended that we didn't take it as such. Shared with the family what had happened and eveyone ended up getting banned from family gatherings. Except now BIL can go home for christmas because his wife is pregnant. We cannot because we would ruin the party.** &#x200B; **Edit 1:** I didn't expect this to get the attention it did. I've been reading the comments and I want to say thank you to everyone who shared resources to help us moving foward. A lot of people have  also been telling their own stories and I can't answer them all but know that I read it and your advices are being heard. This has helped me to get some perspective as I cannot share what happened with my close friends. My husband is aware of this post and he will read it in his own time, right now we will be focusing on the holidays and he would rather deal with it once the celebrations are over. Thank you once again to everyone!","Sounds like you are both best off separating yourselves from his family.  WTF kind of mom enables sex jokes to her daughter in law from her other son? I am NC with my sister and VLC with my Dad over their “jokes” and other issues that could be resolved with a simple apology.

Me, there’s no level of therapy that will give me a decent family, so I’ve long detached myself and moved on.",3930
a8f7d1,"Hey guys, It has been about 4 months since I made my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9641hl/my_36f_boyfriend_50m_cancelled_our_holiday_and/) so I thought I would update. TL:DR - We broke up. After he returned home from his (our?) holiday, I tried to raise some of the issues that were pointed out to my by people who commented on my original post, which all boiled down to a reality that basically our relationship is really only a relationship to me and that for him I am just providing the ""girlfriend experience"" without being able to expect or enjoy any kind of commitment.  He defended his actions and did manage to generate a pretty impressive list of ways he has been there for me over the past 4 years. But as I learned from you wise people, he is really only there for me when it is on his terms, and when he is being ""so sweet"" it is likely an act, whereas the rest of the time he is just being himself.  We broke up a couple of weeks after he returned home. I will admit that it was devastating for me and I really had to go through a grief process for the loss of how I hoped things might turn out. Until about a week ago, he would not leave me alone. He left me daily gifts at my home (actually inside of my home until I made him give me back my key). He recruited my friends to do little surprises for me, knowing I hadn't had the heart to tell people about our break up at that point. It was humiliating. When it was my birthday, he sent a lavish gift based on a sexy inside joke of ours. He came to my work place (he is a consultant there, I am on the payroll) and acted as though we are together, making me cry in the bathroom at how awkward it was because I hadn't told my colleagues about our split at that point. And worse of all, I took myself to a hot country to have a solo vacation - all ""sister doing it for herself"" - and he had the nerve to JOIN ME at the place I was staying after he found out about it from others. When I asked if he was there because he changed his mind and wanted to be with me (hopeless hope, I couldn't help it), he laughed it off and said no, my trip just sounded fun so he thought he'd have fun with me. He ruined a vacation I really needed, and I embarrassed myself crying many tears in a beautiful, tropical paradise surrounded by people in love, or at least that's how it seemed. I realize how horrible he sounds when I write all of this out, but we did have many good years together, including a lot of fun doing a shared hobby that not a lot of people are into and that is super time consuming. I'm not sure how to face him in our mutual spaces anymore. I don't know what switched off for him to finally give me space, but it has helped immensely for me to heal and get over this without him lurking around or love-bombing me to try to get me to change my mind. After the vacation fiasco, I know that he is only reaching out because he misses the convenience I brought to his life, not because he misses me or cares about me, or he never would have done such a rude, selfish thing. I am posting mainly as a thank you to those of you who took the time to reach out and share your perspectives with me, both gently and not-so-gently. I am not sure how I was recruited into allowing him to treat me that way, and I'm working with a very fantastic therapist to learn more about who I am in relationships. It will be hard to spend the holidays without him and I miss his kids a lot, but it is such a good feeling to know that I have a fresh start. I've been enjoying the holiday parties with family and friends this year, and have met a couple of really cute men who are close in my age, seem emotionally available, and are immersed in interesting, creative careers. They flirt with me like I'm a real person - you know, talking and asking questions instead of just compliments and being taken to events like the token ""I got dumped by my wife but check out this hot babe who loves me"" type of girlfriend. I'm being careful and oh so slow, but guys, oh so hopeful too. I am very grateful for your help. I hope you have a lovely holiday and a wonderful new year.  Signed,  Recovering Plaything ","Time to start telling everyone who thinks your still in a relationship something like this: ""Oh him? He is a creep.  3 months after I broke up with him he tried to crash my vacation."" Don't let him prey on you due to the ignorance of others.",4289
a9ef94,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9vjxrb/how_do_i_23_f_back_away_from_this_guy_31_m/) and original TLDR: I went out with a regular at my local cafe and it didn't go well. He's maybe a little unhinged. I don't want to lose my favorite coffee shop. How do I handle this without any awkwardness? So I had been meaning to post an update about this for a while but never got around to it, and then last night something really big happened and I think its really important that you guys keep in mind that this is all happening in my second language, nobody involved in the story speaks English (Except Sarah a little bit). So where we left off with my last post, I had had a conversation with Sarah about Derek that made me feel better. Derek later reached out to me, apologized, said he had drunk too much on an empty stomach and that he was embarrassed about his actions.  I'm sorry you guys, but I agreed to hang out with him again, this time just over coffee. Things were fine and he further integrated me into the neighborhood by introducing me to the people he knows and inviting me to join other neighbors for drinks and such. He opened up to me about a traumatic event that happened to him in his past and about his mental illness. He brought me around his family and his nieces who were all lovely. Other people seemed to adore him. I really liked all of this and we quickly fell into a romantic relationship.  Derek seemed to be almost flaunting the relationship around the neighborhood. I had one other conversation with Sarah where she asked me some questions about how I felt about him. I explained that I liked him but felt confused and that he was moving quickly. She told me, in English so I know she was serious, ""Take your time."" soon after this Derek broke things off with me very suddenly, and rather forcefully. I found his sudden change of heart very confusing and upsetting. A week after he broke up with me I asked him to come over to my apartment to talk about what happened and we agreed to remain friends, since we'd have to see each other around the neighborhood.  I spoke about all this with Sarah, who told me that she didn't know anything about it and said that she was sorry. About a week after I agreed to remain friends with Derek he invited me out for a drink, gave me a necklace, and we got a little bit intimate, but he clearly told me ""Do not talk about me at the bar."" which I found very strange.  This is getting longer than I wanted it to be so I'm going to jump to last night. Sarah and the other woman who owns the cafe are a couple, they've been together for 10 years and they invited me to spend Christmas eve with them since they knew I would be alone. I brought up Derek, of course, and asked them why they thought that he wouldn't want me to talk about him in the Cafe. Silvia played dumb until we had some privacy and then she revealed to me that she and Derek had had a relationship while he was seeing me. At first, he had lied to her and said that we were strictly platonic, but that lie quickly fell apart. Sarah said that she wanted to talk to me about it but never had the opportunity because we were always in the cafe. She apologized that some days she had acted cold towards me (which I hadn't noticed) and she said that after a few weeks she had insisted that Derek choose either her or me. Apparently, he chose her. Soon after that, she ended things with him completely. The next evening he invited me out for a drink to try to rekindle things So Sarah apologized to me. She said she felt stupid and like a bad person, but that she had been feeling old and unattractive lately (she is 50). I told her that I wasn't upset with her at all, just shocked and that I was sorry I had been so oblivious to the real situation.  So, I definitely didn't see that coming. I'm not going to confront Derek about this, I'm just going to let it go and move on. Sorry for acting like an idiot. I wish I could say I've learned something but I probably haven't.  Merry Christmas everybody. TL;DR: Derek and Sarah were together the whole time and Derek was trying to play both of us. Merry Christmas.","wait, wasn't Sarah the one who set you guys up on a date? While she was dating him all along? Why would she do that? These people sound strange OP. If you love the coffee shop that much, by all means - but I wouldn't be attending their family christmases and being all buddy buddy. Anyway, highly anticipated update! Thanks for sharing!",2133
aa98fn," Original TL;DR - It’s always been my new husband and I’s plan to spend our first Christmas Day just us - my mother initially had no issues, but recently has become annoyed about the situation and is suggesting that we’re alienating ourselves and no longer see ourselves as part of the family owing to this and our previous decision to elope. Who is in the right? Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a88m1g/is\_my\_24f\_mother\_56f\_overreacting\_about\_me/). So Christmas has been and gone, and there was a bit more drama than I wanted. After my original post I contacted my mother to reaffirm to her the reasons we wanted to spend Christmas Day itself on our own, and she said that she understood, and said she looked forward to seeing us on Boxing Day. However, a few hours later I got a call from my father asking why my mother was crying and saying that I’d rung her up screaming and shouting about her interfering with our life. I said that nothing like that happened, and that it hurt that she was accusing me of that when I was just trying to be mature about the situation. My father sympathised, and said he’d try to talk to her about it. I checked in frequently in the days up to Christmas, but my mother read and ignored my messages. Whenever I spoke to my father he said that she was telling him I hadn’t been in contact and she was waiting for me to apologise, but he had seen that I was in her call and text history. He advised that visiting on Boxing Day might not be the best idea, but if it got to that stage he would visit us alone since none of this was our doing. We had our own private Christmas Day, during which we found out that I was pregnant! We had started trying for our first child in secret a few months ago, but didn’t suspect anything until I felt sick at the smell of turkey! We’re going to keep this our little secret for the next few weeks at least with everyone, my husband’s family included. I texted my mother to wish her a Happy Christmas in the morning, and sent another text in the evening asking if she still wanted us to go up to visit tomorrow - I got a one word reply, ‘no’. We took my mother at her word and we didn’t visit the following day - I think she was expecting me to grovel at her feet begging for forgiveness, but that’s not going to happen anymore. I called my father and told him that she had decided that we weren’t visiting and it definitely wasn’t on our end. He visited in the afternoon and brought the dog, and we all went for a walk instead of worry about what my mother was doing or saying to other people about it. Apparently a horde of her friends have been told that I shredded her Christmas card and posted it back to them among other things, but I’m done worrying about what my mother says. I’m not at this stage going to completely cut her off or say she can’t see her future grandchild, but our relationship is definitely strained.    TL;DR - Mother tried to act like I was cutting her out when in reality she shut down and ignored me before telling me not to visit on the expected day. Had our own Christmas, and unexpectedly found out we were expecting our first child instead of sitting through an awkward day.","I am really concerned about how much she is lying to your father, her *husband*. He also *knows* she is lying. And she told a pretty big lie to an entire group of friends. This is really troubling.  But wow, did you all handle the situation well! Wow! Great job there. I think she absolutely wanted you to grovel (what did she want you to apologize for anyway?), and you just went about your plans. I'm glad Dad followed through as well and visited. Just brilliant, calm, mature behavior shown by the three of you.  And what a great Christmas gift! Congrats! ",3411
aaevo8,"Previous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a530uu/i\_31f\_wish\_my\_so\_34m\_cared\_about\_life\_as\_much\_as/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a530uu/i_31f_wish_my_so_34m_cared_about_life_as_much_as/)  TLDR: Things are getting better, slowly but surely.   &#x200B; After posting here, I took some of the comments about depression and talked to my SO about how he feels and what I can do to be a better support system for him. He's still continuing therapy and his medication is slightly helping (although it'll take a few more weeks to really kick in) but he registered for his prereq classes without me saying anything or reminding him and he has been trying to help with cleaning when he can. So there has been some overall improvement. We also talked about Pokemon Go, how he's using it as a coping mechanism and how that's okay (I cannot stress enough how I want him to still feel okay playing), but also how we can't just drop everything all the time for it. We just got back from a small holiday trip and the entire time, he kept the Pokemon Go under control and played when we wanted but not when we were doing dinner, taking parents places, and such. He showed a lot of restraint and a lot of respect for the stuff we talked about.  I have also done a few raids with him and his people from discord, and I'm really glad he has this group of random Pokemon people that he knows by their Pokemon nicknames and stuff. It's actually very sweet, and not forced socialization or awkward adult-friend-making...they just go do raids, trade pokemon and know each other from these small moments. It's good for him, especially as his social circle has shrunk over the past few years. It's all so low key and low pressure that I really do think it's healthy for him to do these raids and talk to people about his hobby. I'm also trying to be receptive that his way of ""giving"" to me right now is by helping me with the game. He really likes to play PoGo with me and gets excited when I get a shiny or catch a legendary in a raid. I have to realize that while the depression stops him from acting like he cares about stuff like cleaning or eating, this is a small glimpse into what he can be like once he gets better again (and also, a glimpse of his old self).  I wanted to thank everyone who shared their stories of depression and opened my eyes to the fact that there is so much more to being depressed than just being unmotivated/sad/empty. I had no idea that his motivation in the game was part of the depression and part of coping with life. Thanks for all the stories, seriously, they meant so much.","Please make sure you're taking care of yourself and that your needs are being met. I've been in a relationship like this for 11 years and it hasn't gotten better. There have been glimmers of improvement, but ultimately he's ""alive"" but absolutely without life. He has no friends, no goals, no real interest in anything but games. I'm very sorry you're going through this. I have so so much empathy for you. Over the years I've grown resentful for all of the time I have lost. It would be nice to chat and share care techniques and communication tips.",1807
aahbqj,"My fiancé (let’s call him Adam) and I have been together for 6 years, engaged for 2 years. To complicate things, our wedding is in 2 weeks.  My husband played baseball in college. It was his dream to be a professional baseball player. He was able to play in the minors for a short period of time but was eventually cut. After this, he went to a foreign country to play for a few years. About a year and a half ago, he “retired,” moved back to the states, and got an office job.  In the meantime, I went to law school, graduated, passed the bar, and got a relatively high paying job. I like what I do and, while I don’t know if I want to do this forever, I have no plans of changing jobs anytime soon.  Yesterday, Adam told me that he was thinking about going to a different foreign country (with lower standards) to revive his baseball career. He wants me to come with him.  I did not react well, I’ll admit that. I laughed and asked if he was joking and, when it became clear that he wasn’t, got super pissed. I spent a lot of time and money building my career. I’m honestly insulted that he wants me to give it up.  He says that I could always take a few years off and come back to it when he finishes playing baseball. I argue that I won’t be a particularly desirable candidate to a law firm after taking years off of work. He says I could try to work as a consultant at a foreign firm or at an American firm’s office in that particular country. This would involve changing the area of law that I practice. I practice the type of law that I do because I like it and am good at it. I don’t know if I could be happy practicing in a different area or if I could even get a job with no experience.  He thinks I’m being unsupportive and has threatened to go regardless of whether I agree to come with. I think he’s being delusional. I know this is harsh and I would never say it like this to him but he tried this and failed twice. Why would he put himself through that again?  If he doesn’t like his current job and wants to do something else, that’s fine. I will support a career change. But I will absolutely not give up my job to chase a dream that will likely never pan out. I know it’s his dream but most people don’t actually get to do their dream job. I feel like he needs to grow up.  I’m sorry if this comes off as insensitive. I am just so frustrated. I’m looking for any advice about how to tackle this problem. Do I let him go on his own? Do I put my foot down? TL;DR:  fiancé wants me to give up my job so that he can chase his dream career that he has already tried and failed at twice ",He’s 28. He’d be in his senior years but probably retired if he played professionally consistently in the us. He’s being delusional and you shouldn’t put your career in jeopardy for someone that can’t even make it in the Orioles minor league team. ,2943
ab7uyu,"I was dating my boyfriend for 2 years (we didn't live together but lived on the same street and I was always over at his place). We each had kids from a previous relationship so I wanted to take the whole ""living together"" thing slowly, but we were together all the time (and I just maintained my own residence).  .   He commuted for work, and I knew his department got a new secretary.  She was younger and married and had recently had a baby.  I knew they were work buddies and I even bought a birthday gift for him to give to her.  After about a year she moved to another State.  .   My boyfriend and I decided to move in together and we lived together for a year when I found out that he and that secretary had some type of (non physical but still romantic) relationship while they were working together. And that is why she ended up leaving (because they both realized it was not appropriate).  .   I stumbled on old emails between them that were strange. Calling each other pet names. He was calling her baby and sweetie in work emails. Telling each other that they couldn't wait to see each other at work. Meeting up in the cafeteria for coffee every day. He told her he loved her. She lamented that she couldn't stop thinking about him while at home. They had little quarrels.  I also realized that he was still facebook friends with her.  .  We talked a lot about this and he said he was just so unhappy at work at the time and unhappy with our relationship (news to me??!) because we didn't live together that he was vulnerable to attention from a beautiful woman.  He said it never became physical but they were very emotionally entangled at the time for many months. I had no idea at all.  He said together they decided the best thing was for her to accept another job offer (which he helped her get).  .   He's very remorseful sometimes. Other times he will tell me that it's partially my fault because I rarely stayed over (I don't think that's true at all -- in fact I was the only one working on us -- he was so busy at work that I carried most of the relationship at that time).  I was doing everything for him to help him out because I knew how busy he was and how stressful life was for him back then.  He will also try to tell me I was too cold (again, he didn't bother mentioning that to me then).  .   I've tried to move past this. I told him he needed to delete her from facebook, and he did. It's been over a year since I found out but I still feel so much hurt and anger if I think about it, or if something triggers me (even something as stupid as a movie where the man is hooking up with his secretary).  .   It's been over a year of anger, fighting, hurt and drama. The man I thought I was with is not the guy who would speak to his married secretary like that.  Should I just give up? I'm tired of feeling this way.   .   *TLDR. after I moved in I found out the year prior my boyfriend had some kind of relationship with his secretary and I think it has forever changed our relationship.*","Sometimes you just can't get over something. You gave it more than a fair shot by staying a full year. You don't trust him, he doesn't really seem to acknowledge what he did and that it was his fault, you're just miserable... Time to move on.",3366
abayxw,"tl;dr My husband and I got into an argument and he left for almost 2 days. Husband is 36m, I'm 29 f. We've been together for over a decade. We have a 7 month old daughter. In the past, we have normally resolved arguments by taking a few hours to cool off and discussing. However, this situation is different and I don't know what to do. We flew back from his parent's house the day before yesterday. While we were picking up the bags, I leaned over and whispered to him that it's sexy to watch him lift the bags off the conveyor belt. Our daughter was asleep in the stroller when this happened, and I whispered quietly so she wouldn't have heard me even if she were awake. He snapped at me really loudly and said ""do NOT say those things in front of MY child."" It was loud enough that people were staring and I was really embarrassed. Then we got home and I put the baby to bed and then he tried to initiate sex with me. I told him I wasn't in the mood after what happened at the airport, and he lost it and said I shouldn't put sex in his head by calling him sexy and then not have sex with him. I told him I would've be up for sex had he not snapped at me! He turned and left our house and I haven't seen him in almost two days. I tried calling him and just got a text back that said he wants space to cool off so he ""doesn't do something he'll regret."" I told him to come home NOW as I've been alone with the baby for 2 days and it's New Years but he won't. Should I give him space or give him an ultimatum? Edit: Thank you all for the comments. A lot has happened since I posted this and the situation is being resolved. I'll post an update when I can. Happy and healthy new year to you all.",I'm sorry you're going through that. It seems like there's something going on that's deeper than what's being explained in the story. How he reacted was extremely inappropriate.

abjake,"Hi all.  I'm a law student, and met my boyfriend Tom through mutual friends around the start of our first year. We've been together for eight months now and its the happiest I've ever been. Tom is a medical student, and we're both the first people in our families to make it to higher education.  In Tom's class there is a girl called Isabel. Tom told me she's top of the year and word is going around that she's a ''future world changer'' or something like that. They weren't close friends but she used to help him study sometimes, he says shes so smart that ''anyone would be an idiot to turn down her help''.  Anyway I didn't meet her until me and Tom were grabbing some food and she came into the same place with her girl friends. The first thing I noticed about her was that she was absolutely gorgeous. Literally a solid 10. They started chatting and she asked who I was. Tom said (and thinking about this makes me smile) with a huge smile that I was his girlfriend, and Isabel's response was to say ''Thought you had better taste than that?''. I was a bit hurt and Tom was confused, but neither of us thought much of it.  Anyway, we didn't deal with her again until a month or so later when Tom's flatmates left the place to him so he invited me over. We were watching a movie when Tom got a call from Isabel, who was crying, saying she'd been kicked out of a club for being stoned and it was nearby his place, asking if she could stay the night until the morning. Tom wanted to say no but I didn't want to just leave her out there.  When she got in she was absolutely drunk and high as possible. Giggling and laughing and reeking of weed. Her clothes were ruined from where she'd spilt her drink over them. I helped clean her up. I always bring a change of clothes when I stay away, but I gave them to her to make her more comfortable. Instead of saying thank you she tried to say how ''cheap'' my clothes were and how she wouldn't be seen dead dressed like that. I tried to tell her not to speak to me like that but she just made fun of my accent and how I speak. I put it down to the alcohol/drugs and didn't hold it against her.  Ever since then Tom started to distance himself from her. He still accepted her help with work but nothing else beyond that, and even that came to an end after she told him she'd only keep helping him if he went out with her. The final straw came not long after we came back for second year. Myself and Tom went out clubbing. Isabel and her friends were there. Tom got extremely drunk and was being sick in the toilets. He could barely stand up and was confused. One of Isabels friends came up to us and announced to him that she'd seen me kissing another guy while he was being sick. Tom got hugely emotional and wanted me to confirm/deny it. It took a lot for me to calm him down and convince him it was a lie, by which point Isabel had already ran over to ''comfort'' him. He realised it was her that made up the lie and shouted at her to leave us alone, and she started crying and went to the security accusing us of acting aggressively towards her, at which point we were both kicked out.  Ever since then she has left us alone. We spent Christmas with our families but were together for New Years. After watching the fireworks, we were snuggling in bed when Tom got an insta DM from Isabel. She sent him a few pictures of her with dyed hair and the words ''New Year, New Me.'' Let's just say those pics reveal much more than just her new hair colour. Tom was fuming. He swore at her and blocked her on everything.  That's good, but when we go back to uni she's still going to be around. Her and her friends frequent most of the places we go to, and she's still in his class. What's going to stop her from bothering him again? He's said he wants nothing to do with her, but she obviously doesn't feel the same way.  TL;DR: A girl from my boyfriends class acted unpleasantly to me and then tried to break us up, before sending him pictures last night.","That chick is toxic and obsessive. Your boyfriend took the right steps here and has been behaving just the way I would expect a good man to. So bravo to him for how he's handling this. No more kindness or ""benefit of the doubt"" should be given to this woman. Assume all behavior from her is going to be rude and manipulative. If you or Tom are out somewhere and run into her, if you do not HAVE to be at that location, then LEAVE. Make sure your mutual friends in his program know the history you posted here, and that they make sure you guys are not invited to the same events she is. I don't know a lot about medical school, but if there are group projects or schoolwork that Tom and Isabel are assigned to do together then make sure professors know about her behavior and ask to be reassigned.  If she continues this behavior, make sure you have as much documentation of these incidents as possible. Take it to school administrators as evidence of sexual harassment. Make sure the university steps in if the behavior escalates.  Other than that, keep ignoring and block/delete anywhere you haven't already. Eventually she will either get a clue, move on to someone else, or escalate to the point where university administrators have the authority to get involved. Good luck! She sounds like an absolute psycho.",3915

He was babbling and I couldn't understand him, so I kept asking him to slow down. Then he started screaming (not yelling, literally just screaming). I freaked out because I thought he was being murdered or something. I tracked his phone to a park in town and called 911. Turns out he had a complete mental breakdown. He's in the process of being diagnosed with a mental illness that usually shows up in people's 20s but for some reason manifested later in him.

adftvf,"**TL;DR: The girl my ex cheated on me with randomly messaged me a couple months back, turns out she was pregnant! Kind of got closure, am very happy.** Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9mb89u/girl_20sf_who_my_23f_ex_23m_cheated_on_me_with/ Hi all, my initial post didn't garner much attention, but I wanted to give a short update. I never responded back to Jessica and basically told her that while I understood she was guilty there really isn't anything she can and should do for me. Just that she has to make better decisions now and hopefully her guilt would mean she wouldn't hurt another person like that again.  During the Holidays, my ex's dad greeted me a Merry Christmas. I was also told of the news that Jessica was 4-5 months pregnant with my ex's child. :O It lines up now, and I guess that's why she messaged me, because they found out around that time. Just wish she was really sorry lmao.  After that my ex and I had the chance to talk. While of course I was still not ok with the fact that he cheated on me, I wouldn't wish ill on an unborn child. He has a lot of growing up to do, and is not the most financially stable person. It also turns out the girl is quite young. I told him that I wished him well despite everything. His dad told me that he still believes he can make something of himself.  When my ex and I talked, he admitted to me that the reason he cheated was because he knew I was already going to break up with him. This is partly true because months before, I sat him down and talked to him about issues in our relationship, and I had wanted to bring his attention to the fact that things really were no longer healthy. I guess it was my prelude to an amicable break-up. He told me that there really was a better way to break things off, but that he was too scared to be alone after breaking up. So he made sure he had someone to run to when we finally broke things off. I just really wish we could have ended things better, he was my best friend.  The news shocked me, but in a way I guess I was able to get closure. I'm currently in a good and healthy relationship and starting the year with a really great outlook.   Thank you all for the advice! I wish everyone had a great holiday! **EDIT:** Oh wow, I really wasn't expecting this to blow up! I thought my post was locked but glad I checked. I was sick last night and only had the chance to see it now! Just a few clarifications because a lot of people have questions. I'm sorry I wasn't too clear on the details, as I didn't want to submit such a lengthy post. I realized after re-reading my post how confusing I was! My apologies :) First is that yes, I did respond back to Jessica (the message I detailed in this post) ~~before~~ after (sorry I made a mistake!) the reddit post, but she responded again. I no longer messaged back after, hope that's clear. You are all correct, based on the timeline she did get pregnant after we broke up/I discovered his cheating. What I didn't mention or was fully clear with yet is, around 4 or 5 months ago, my ex talked to me and told me that she and Jessica broke up, because they realized that they were in a relationship for the wrong reason. We talked for closure, but I realize now he was also testing the waters with me. I could be wrong tho!  There are a number of people who also question why I kept in contact with people in my ex's life, or why I even talked to him after everything. I agree that it isn't the most healthy or mature, and I call myself out on that a lot of times. It was just really hard to detach from his family, who I grew close to. When my ex's dad last talked to me, he told me that things will never change and he still loves me like a daughter. :') And while a lot of people don't agree with my last communication with my ex, I think it was helpful for both of us in the process of moving forward. I think we left the conversation clearing out that we don't have hate for each other, just wishing each other well.  Also, I have to admit that I don't have the most positive image of Jessica, and I watch myself a lot of times not to be hateful. It's hard to judge when you only have the negative things shown to you. She did a lot of hurtful things to me (outside the cheating), but in the grand scheme of things, I really don't know the full story anyway. With how the chips fell, I think all I can do now is wish them the best.  2018 was a tough year. Went through a break-up, was cheated on, lost my sister, had to re-contact my ex to get things my sister used to own back (these are the things I referenced to in my initial post), and basically had to pull myself back up after all the pain and losses.  But I am glad to leave it all behind in 2018, and I am starting 2019 strong! Thank you for all the positivity and warm wishes everyone! To a healthy year of growth ahead! :) ","Well, you dodged a bullet for sure.. too bad Jessica didn't, poor girl. Thanks for posting an update, and I truly hope you never have to deal with another childish man again. Hugs.",887
af6lmf,"Original Post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ae6inj/is_it_wrong_for_mef20_to_choose_my_friendship/ Thanks to all the people who gave me their advice and perspective on the matter, it was greatly appreciated and helped me sort my priorities out.  First, let me clear up some things I probably should have made clearer in the original post: The thing with the mind reading is not really meant to be taken as a soul mate situation. Ben sometimes struggles to get a point across but I seem to get it most of the times and can tell people what he meant to say. So I think this got blown out of proportion a bit. I should have phrased this differently, sorry. Also, many people referred to Chris as my boyfriend in their comments, which he was not. We were dating for a month and weren’t an official couple. Another thing I should have talked about is how Ben and I ended up dating for a second time. An acquaintance told us that it was a shame that us dating never worked out and we decided to test the waters again. Not even a month in I said that it did not feel right, he agreed and said how relived he was that I felt it too and we went back to being friends. That was considerably easy since we hadn’t even had sex in that month. Chris knew that the second time wasn’t all that serious. One comment was suspicious of why Ben hadn’t moved on so I probably should‘ve mentioned that Ben had a girlfriend from February to June 2018. I liked her and she was always lovely to me. She left him because, ironically, she still had feelings for her ex. So I thought it‘d be safe to assume that he‘d be over me as well. None of my close friends talked about my history with Ben and they didn’t joke about us at the party. They genuinely want me to be happy and most of them instantly liked Chris. However something did happen at the party that ended up causing all this mess. So buckle up folks. Now that that’s been said, let’s move on to the shit show that’s been my life for the last couple of days. After reading some of your comments I texted Chris back and agreed to talk about things that night under the condition that we both will be civil and adult about it. He was fine with that and I came over to his place. Chris started the conversation by immediately apologizing for how aggressive he reacted and how stupid he felt for not being able to keep it together. He said it wasn’t fair of him to mistrust me and that his jealousy was ridiculously overblown considering we weren’t even official. I told him that it’s okay if he gets jealous or uncomfortable but I just wished we could have talked about it before things escalated. I apologized for not being sensitive enough to realize that no matter what he said to me, he wouldn’t exactly be thrilled with the situation. I could have made more of an effort to reassure him and adapt situations so that we could both be happy. We both made it clear that it would make us sad if things ended before they had even begun and we’d probably end up regretting not giving this another shot. After all, we have this crazy chemistry and got along so well. Now all that seemed to stand in the way of a happy ending was an awkward conversation about my friendship with Ben. But before I could even get into it Chris dropped this bomb: So at the party he overheard Ben and his best friend talking. Ben said how awful it was to see me with another guy and how unfair it was that we weren’t an item. Chris did not know what to do with that. He said that that’s where what little jealousy and insecurity he had went from zero to a hundred and he couldn’t help seeing red. He weight his options and thought that if he’d tell me it’d end in a situation where it’s his word against Ben’s and I’d believe Ben more. He also didn’t want to be “that guy that ruined a friendship“. So he swallowed his feelings until they burst out when I casually mentioned hanging out with Ben. As he told me that, I put my guard up and took it with more than just a grain of salt. That story sounded almost cartoonishly convenient. Some people in the comments warned me that he could try to manipulate me and I had to look out for myself. I told him in all honesty that I‘d have to talk to some other people as it was hard to take his word for it given the current situation. Chris was very understanding and told me that to whatever solution I‘d come, he‘d have to accept it because as he put it he “lost the right to be involved in this with throwing a jealous fit“. I disagreed but he was adamant about me having to find my truth. We ended the night with me telling him that I really wanted to trust in what he said to me for the sake of salvaging our relationship but it was just so hard and I was so confused. He again said that he understands and that I should take my time to sort things out. Then he gave me a long hug (yes, this one was actually long) and I left to figure things out. And oh boy did I figure things out... The first thing that came into my head was that at the party in September, the one where I was dared to kiss Ben, guess who thought of the dare. It was Ben‘s best friend, who, if I‘d take Chris’ word, would know if Ben still had feelings for me. Ben’s friend was also the person who suggested playing truth or dare in the first place even though he usually doesn’t like that many drinking/party games. Then I thought about how weird Ben acted when I asked him about Chris. At the time I was convinced that he just didn’t want to hurt my feelings but what if he just saw his chance of getting Chris out of the picture and held an inner debate whether he should act on it or not. My head was in bits and pieces as I overanalysed basically every interaction I had with Ben for the past months. I had to rip the band aid off and talk to Ben directly. So I asked him if he’d be free after work and he came over. We usually don’t spend time alone at each other’s place so he knew that something wasn’t quite right. It was very awkward but I had carefully thought about what to say beforehand which made it a bit easier. I told Ben that I value our friendship but had gotten the suspicion that he might want more out of our relationship than I could give him and asked if this was true. Ben is a bad liar so he got defensive instead and asked me if Chris wanted to separate us. He used that phrasing. “Separate us” I told him that it did not matter if Chris was involved in this because I just wanted a clear answer on whether us being friends was enough for him or not. He avoided the answer. Asking again if this was because of Chris. He spun in circles trying to change the subject and ended up saying some mean things about Chris not being a good person and what not (Reminder that their first and only interaction had been at the party). I however stayed focused, as I wanted an answer. Given, his avoiding of my question was answer enough but I was getting angry with him and I wanted him to spell it out. After some more back and forth he finally snapped: “Fine! I thought that we’d eventually get back together and it was only a matter of time until you realized that we were meant to be! You should be with me then we wouldn’t have to deal with this.” His words still echo in my head. Like, what…? I could have handled him having a little crush on me or if he felt that some things were left unresolved, but this? It felt like my entire world was shattered. All these years of friendship he just stuck around to one day get back together with me? Everything we’ve been through and everything he did for me was just so that I’d eventually realize that we should date again? I told him that I couldn’t return his feelings. Not now and not in the future. We had tried twice, it didn’t work out, at least for me it didn’t, and I saw nothing that could change that. I wanted us to be friends but I don’t think it is possible under these conditions. He got pretty worked up about it and it was like watching someone go through all stages of grief except acceptance. “We can still work this out!” “This is unfair!” “Nobody will ever love me!” “I’ll change and we can try again in a few months!” It took a lot out of me but I remained calm and told him that it’d be better if we stopped seeing each other for quite some time. Then I asked him to leave. I was exhausted and honestly creeped out. I felt so betrayed. This person that I was so close to and that I trusted so much was always acting with an ulterior motive. I called my best friend and once she heard me sob through the speaker she got in her car and came over. I told her what had happened and she was horrified. She had no idea. As word spread in these last two days it turned out that my friends didn’t know about his feelings either and most of them were shocked and repelled by how he acted. I got some amazing support from my friends and they were great at helping me not losing my head over this so far. Chris and I talked yesterday and I apologized for putting him in such a horrible situation. I hadn’t wanted for us to start out with this level of drama. He believes that I wasn’t to blame but I still think I should have realized some things earlier... it’s been five years of “friendship” for Christ‘s sake... Chris was very sweet. He ordered food from my favourite take out place, we watched a movie and cuddled up on the sofa. He said that he was glad that we came out okay and somehow everything was worth the struggle in the end. He also asked if I wanted to be his girlfriend and I said yes. So tl;dr: Ben had feelings for me for years and expected that I’d just get back together with him one day. I told him that I couldn’t be friends with him if that’s what he wants. Chris and I are now an official couple and can’t wait for a drama free relationship.","Honestly, this is a pretty comfortable example of how easy it can be for an unbiased stranger to look at a situation and see what's really going on.

He was very receptive to my input, open to change, and apologized for slacking off and being lazy. He also thanked me for communicating everything so well.  After finally a month when the kids were laid to bed and there was more quiet and less chaos. I sat down at the table and discussed with my husband how I felt burnt out and exhausted assuming nearly all of the household chores and mental load.  This came after I came prepared with a written sort of cluster diagram of every chore that I do and all the mental “inventory” I have to keep track of in the house (e.g. shampoo, groceries, diapers, kids clothes, toilet paper, etc) I explained that I have to keep all the balls in the air, if I don’t, then it negatively affects how easy the household is run and will negatively affect other people. For example, if I just boycott keeping track of things that run low, such as toilet paper or diapers or laundry detergent, it’s not good for anyone. A kind of “emergency” situation would arise.  If my husband fails to do his chores, he was oblivious to how it implicitly places the burden on me to pickup the slack. His time spent on leisure activities and not his household responsibilities shifts more chores on to me, while diminishing *my* free time that I could have. The household is like a business and everyone has to chip in and do their part.  After explaining all this, my husband was very open and apologetic of the fact he was so unaware of how his behavior and lack of action was negatively affecting me. He confessed his “radar” for seeing things on the floor or that need to be put away just wasn’t there and he really needs to keep working on making that better.  He also apologized for prioritizing his fun hobby projects over completing his chores first and then, consequently, leaving no time for his chores due to the interruptions of our kids. He also apologized for his lazy behavior and said he’s really going to make a better system for himself to get his household tasks routinely done that doesn’t require me asking.  In the end, he said he really appreciated me bringing this up in the way that I did and reaffirmed that everything I do “Does not go unnoticed” and that he is so thankful for all that I do.  It feels good to talk things through calmly as adults and come to a healthy solution that comes with concrete action. Here’s looking towards a less-stressful future ahead :)  ","I'm glad you and your husband were able to discuss the situation calmly and he responded positively to what you have to say! I am curious however, did y'all actually come up with a plan to divide the household labor? I believe you when you say your husband *intends* to do more work around the home, but as they say, ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions.""  A plan such as a chore chart, timeline for doing chores (e.g. mop the floor every Wednesday, load the dishwasher every evening) takes away a lot of the need to develop ""radar"". Responsibilities are clearly and explicitly laid out which sets everyone up to succeed.",1032
ahtgdj,"I just want to say up front that I'm a dumbass and I know it, and this whole situation is my fault, but I do need help. My wife and I were high school sweethearts and got married very young. We went to the same college and got married when we were both 19 year old sophomores. I love her and we definitely made the right decision, and I would do it all over again exactly the same way with no hesitation except for one thing-the ring that I picked. Now when I was a teen I was definitely a douche. I'm talking affliction tees, hair gel, recreational MMA, macho bs. We picked out our rings together, and of course I wanted my ring to look cool. My wife, who is brilliant and always has been, chose a classy and timeless style for hers, and I did not. Friends, my ring is large, clunky, mostly black, and has a cringy design on it in silver along with a band of lab created fire opal inlay. I thought it was so badass at the time, and could not understand what my dad was laughing about when he first saw it. Well I sure get it now.  I've matured a TON in the last ten years and have slowly come to hate it. I am very self conscious of it at my professional office job, and sometimes even take it off if I have important meetings with clients. I feel horribly guilty every time.  I've gently broached the topic of maybe getting a ring that looks more professional, but my wife has pushed back, saying that we picked our rings together and have had them for ten years and that's really special to her. I absolutely do not want to hurt her feelings. How can I approach this in a way that would make it easier for her to accept, short of doing a full-on vow renewal with new rings (suggested by my best friend; is the nuclear option due to cost)? TLDR: I was an idiot teenager when I got married, picked out an Ed Hardy level wedding ring, need to replace it without hurting my wife's feelings. Edit: Thank you all for the great advice! I have a lot to consider, but I have a lot of new ideas now. I don't want to post a pic of my ring because I don't want to be able to be identified from this post, but you can find pics of similar rings by googling the descriptors I used, like some people in the comments have pointed out. ","Can you tell her that you really want to replace your ring with something more adult and professional, and that your current one isn’t a good reflection of that. and want to put your previous ring in a shadow box on your bedside table, or frame it? Just tell her it’s purely about the aesthetics and you want something to match a more mature style ",4017

It is an amazing opportunity in a beautiful city with a reasonable cost of living. It is a job doing exactly what I want to do with a team I really liked and on which I feel my contributions would be heavily valued. The BF and I have amicably ended our relationship. Unfortunately, I'm going to be stuck here for the next 3.5 months because I can't afford to move out there (2500 miles away) more than a few weeks before the job starts, even though all my classes this semester are online. I can't really go out to many local social events during that time, since I know I will see my now-ex, and it would feel like a dagger twisting through my heart to see him with a new girl. I still think I'm making the best decision for my career (and likely my future happiness); the next few months are just going to suck. TL;DR: I accepted the job offer like everyone told me to, even though it ended my 7-month relationship.","Okay, don't spend your last days of freedom before starting a job hiding because you are afraid of running into an ex.

But Had said she would still be able to pay rent with her residual income. The time came and she was late. And only paid a third of what she needed to. Well I can’t move right now. Luckily my name is primary on the lease. And She is legally subletting with me. I went over a new lease agreement. And it has a weekly amount she has to pay me to catch up on rent and continue paying rent. If she preaches this contract in accordance with my state law. She will be evicted. She refuses to talk to me. She refuses to leave her room. I told her that I don’t hate her and I still deeply care about her. But she has to pay or else she has to leave and I’ll find someone else to rent the second bedroom. The place we rented have rooms for each of us so that we could have a private space as well as time with each other. If she’s not able to pay I’m planning on affecting her and finding someone else to rent. My heart is broken. With the planning this for over a year. And I know she’s depressed. But she could go back to work tomorrow and make double what I do a day. With a career she’s in she could still go back to work even after having quit. I loved her so much. And we had built detailed and amazing plans together. But she’s just stopped moving. I know she’s depressed but I don’t know what to do for her. I’ve tried talking to her I’ve tried offering to help her. I’ve offered to take her to a doctor. I’ve told her that I’m there for her. But I can’t do this for her. It’s like she’s just given up. And I love her, but this is not the agreement that we had together. If she was willing to go see a doctor I would at least be able to work with her. And find a way to make this work. But I can’t support somebody who sick and refuses to go see help. It’s been a month and a half since she moved and it’s been a disaster. I feel like there should’ve been warning signs but there wasn’t. It’s like a flip switched and she’s turned into a different person. I’ve lost my girlfriend. It’s like she’s dead and there’s this shell standing in front of me.

ap8ipb,"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/am3mwy/my_25_m_boyfriends_26_m_anxiety_comes_out/).  I'd like to begin by thanking everyone who left some input; I was overwhelmed by the response. Just know that I did read every single comment. It hasn't been very long at all; I know that. And I truly don't know what the future holds. But here's what has happened in the past ten days or so.  I admit, I should have talked to Charlie earlier before heading ""to bed"" again, but I was embarrassed about broaching the subject and still ruminating over the advice.  And so, his anxiety flared again during sexy time that night. Rather than immediately falling into comforting him, I began asking him why he was feeling like he was and resisting the instinct to ""make it all better."" It was a little more tough love than I've ever been with him (and we haven't been together all that long), but it got him to open up.  I did flat-out tell him (in a nice way) that this was getting in the way, that we had to solve this sooner rather than later, and that I didn't like him accusing me of being untruthful in-bed.  And he responded to that, apologized, and agreed that we could not go on like this. What actually started coming up as we talked were some things I hadn't considered.  He was tired at the end of work, distracted by stresses from earlier in the day, finding it challenging both physically and mentally to stay focused and creating this self-fulfilling prophecy, where the fear of being distracted and unable to be a satisfying partner was doing just that. He was also very embarrassed to not be in the mood sometimes, and I do think that was tied in to the ""failure"" mindset. If he didn't feel like getting going, he was failing me as a partner. I asked him to be open with that. I also told him that we didn't have to go all the way every time if there were other ways to enjoy the moment.  And then on to concrete solutions.  Long story short, Charlie and I have spent the last ten days or so just relaxing together at night and reserving early mornings for intimacy (thanks, /u/NerdWithoutACause). Less stress, less fatigue, and it's been a rather amazing physical solution. No anxiety flares yet on this revised schedule, when we can do it first-thing and not be under the stress of a long day. But time will tell if this will keep up, I suppose. Charlie did have therapy three days ago, and he allowed me to look at the notebook he had brought with him.  He'd brought this all up, and there were some more ""in the moment"" solutions for when his anxiety flared. He's been very open about making the greater effort to control his symptoms on his own without relying exclusively on me. Waking up to him this morning, he also rather bashfully told me he was feeling under the weather and would prefer if we just cuddled. So we did. And other PG-13 stuff eventually came. It was nice, and I think I have hope. tl;dr: Resolved to stop comforting boyfriend in bed when his anxiety flared, and realized that outside stressors were part of his flares. We do it in the morning now when there are less of those stressors, and he's working harder in therapy and being more vocal about what he's feeling in the moment. I'm a happy camper for now.

aqwiie,"My boyfriend of slightly over a year has finished his studies and has landed his first job in a new country. He wants me to leave my job (and career) and everything I've known and move to a new country / continent to be with him. I feel that he expects me to sacrifice my career and social life and start from scratch in a new place with him while he has absolutely no real investment or commitment in this relationship. I said I viewed being engaged a sign that he is invested in the relationship and that I want to be engaged before I throw away everything I've known, to follow him to a new place. He however disagrees and believes this is an outrageous thing to suggest. Thoughts? Tl;dr: I want to be engaged before moving countries to close distance with currently ldr bf. He disagrees. What's the right thing to do?","If he is not ready to be engaged, trust me, it is best that the two of you are not. ""Forcing"" him into it may lead to marriage, but it may then lead to divorce. When people feel obligated to move down that path, but their heart is not in it, people end up in very shitty, loveless marriages defined by resentment. Of course you shouldn't follow him though! Why didn't he try to get a job near you? Why didn't he respect your career and your life? I get that when one starts one's career there is no choice, but seriously, the expectation that you will just drop everything and follow him is very selfish and sexists. If you care for him, and he cares for you, try a long distance relationship for a year or so. If your relationship survives that, then you can figure out closing that distance somehow.

I took a lot of your advice. I spoke to him about it again, and said we need to come up for a solution because I couldn’t go on with such little help anymore.  We wrote a list as someone had suggested . (Sorry I don’t know how to link usernames) and I wrote what I do and he wrote what he did. My list was much bigger than his and he said he didn’t realise How ‘unequal’ the lists were and he thought we were doing pretty much the same. He thanked me for everything I did, and said he’d change. We take it in turns with the nappy changes and the story times etc and it’s working very well. Now we have certain things we both need to get done. He will bath the kids on the nights he’s home so he gets to spend more one on one time. He’ll read stories and is being much more involved. I still do a lot which I’m fine with, (the things SAHP do) but I want to stay home with the kids and do the majority as I feel that’s what I’m happiest with doing. I’m just appreciative of the help he’s now giving me. I don’t feel alone anymore.  I think with a new baby and a toddler and working full time, it was getting a bit on top of him but we communicate better and when he’s feeling overwhelmed, I’ll do more and vice versa. I do think I have to ask him some things still, but I feel like that only happens when we have had a bit of a busy/hard day. but we have more of an understanding of one another now.  We also read the articles commenters recommended and that is definitely in the back of our mind.  I do feel I got into the habit of doing things myself and would bathe and read, etc without really giving him that time and now I’m encouraging him even more to do things one on one with the kids. As I was always there when he was spending time with them, I’m trying to make it where he actually gets alone time with them as well. As I think that was making him feel like a “secondary “ parent if that makes sense. He has a much better bond with the kids now, and we are all so much happier. As a family and us as a couple.  I might have missed things so if you wanna know anything else ill answer. I know this isn’t the most amazing update and it’s just a case of communicating better but you’ve all helped so much and I’m very appreciative. I love reddit! Thanks for all your comments/advice.   TLDR : a case of communicating better and following your advice has helped us thanks so much  ",It makes me so happy to read this kind of update. Good for you for communicating things and great that your partner listened and makes the effort so you both will be happier. This is the way to build lasting relationships <3,1390

I refused to take them and explained that I don't have time to do these things for them anymore.  She called me selfish and said I don't care about family anymore before she threw the box in her car and drove off.

The letter consisted of sentiments of love and understanding, but also emphasised how her behavior has to stop, and that she needs to seek DBT therapy. I also set very specific boundaries in place and asked her to agree to them. I gave her a heads up via Whatsapp that the email had been sent to to ask her to read it and think on it before we spoke. Her reaction was very positive - ""I just want to say thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart, for writing this letter. I am so incredibly grateful and so moved, that you would do this for me after all I have said to you and on top of that having to deal with being sleep deprived and having baby issues. I honestly I am in tears right now because I truly thought that I would have to try and rebuild our relationship on my own and honestly I haven't got the tools or knowledge to know how to do that and I've been so stressed not really knowing what to do or say but knowing that I need to resolve things. I also knew that we needed to set some rules and understandings to help you cope with the situation should it happen again and so I know the consequences if things get too bad and this will hopefully help me to get myself out of it.

Hope I'm formatting it right. After making the original post, I couldn't get the situation off my mind - it was driving me nuts and really just stressing me out. I talked it over with my mom, and asked my aunt to send me some pics of 'Andy'. She asked why, and I told her that I wanted to compare them to the painting of him she'd started. So I acquired the pictures, then did a reverse image search as many of you suggested. Thank goodness she sent me more than one picture of the guy, because only the last one got a hit, but from there, it was smooth sailing. Turns out the REAL guy is a poplar instagram model. He's got info about him being a Marine, and having a dog with the same name as Andy's dog right in his bio. This dude was so lazy he just lifted the real man's basic info. The DOG even has an instagram, and I found more photos Andy sent to her. And to make my life even easier, the real guy has a series of videos up in his Highlights section labeled 'SCAMMERS'. I watched them and basically it was him addressing what to do if someone is being catfished with his pics. I was super nervous, but confident I had what I needed. So from there, I slept on it, and then asked my aunt if I could come visit. My mom helped me stay calm beforehand, and the worst part leading up to it was standing in their house saying hello and just waiting to drop the bomb. I started off with saying 'there's actually a reason i'm here. I have something to tell you, and you won't like it.' I explained my motives for getting Andy's pics, the reverse image search, and finding the real guy. I pulled up his profile, and the dog's, and let her scroll through it while answering questions she and my grandma had. She tried to call Andy, text him, and just...it was weird guys. She used the phrase ""I'll go psycho on his ass"" in several variants. She never struck me as that type of person, but she was just blowing him up, and of course, when she FINALLY got ahold of him, and asked him to explain what I'd found. ugh, his voice. She had him on speakerphone. ""Baby, what you saying?"" (this was basically his answer to everything she said.) ""Baby, we don't need this. You just gotta trust."" I wanted to grab the phone and tell him to cut his crap, but didn't. I stayed a couple more hours, answering questions, trying to console her. Apparently they'd actually been talking for like...two years? I'm torn on whether or not to believe that, bc as much as I love my aunt, i know from experience she can bend the truth to fit delusions sometimes. Anyways. My grandma, who was there the whole time, was being her usual brusque self, so I pulled her aside and tried to explain that this wasn't the time for tough love, but for the band-aid-and-kisses type of motherly support. She agreed, and thanked me, saying that she's been seeing my aunt 'change', but she didn't say how. After we went back into the main room, she was trying to be a little more sensitive, but it doesn't come naturally to her. From there, I needed to go to work and take care of something before the work day ended. Since then, unfortunately, it seems that despite my warnings that she would not get anything that could be guaranteed as the truth out of Andy, she insisted on 'demanding explanations' and now he's got her convinced that everything they had was real, and that a friend had dared him into the deception. So now, according to her, ""they are talking, and there's a lot of trust to rebuild."" I'm saddened by the turn of events, but I did my job, and she's an adult who has to make her own choices. I'm trying to let go of the outcome, which obviously wasn't he one I hoped for, and to not feel hurt. I know she's going through a lot emotionally, and that it was silly to hope my intervention would change things. Hopefully, she'll see the truth of it sooner rather than later, and I can have played a part in that. Tl;dr: I found the instagram of the real guy that Andy was stealing pics from, and took the information to my aunt to tell her she was being catfished. She cried, asked questions, I comforted for a few hours then left, advising her to cut off contact with him. Unfortunately she didn't, since then, he's told her 'it was a dare' and they are 'talking and rebuilding trust.'","Ultimately, you're right. You can only arm her with information what she chooses to do and who she chooses to believe is on her.  I do wonder about finances. Does your grandmother have shared accounts with your aunt that this ""Andy"" could access through your Aunt? IANAL or within the finance world but  It  might be worth talking to some family members about ensuring she doesn't have access to grandma's finances etc. It's horrible enough whats going on I'd hate to see anyone caught up in this mess.  Best of luck and for what it's worth i think you did a great (and brave!) Thing in getting to the bottom of this scam and giving her information, hopefully she can see the light and find peace and break away from this scammer. ",1064

I mean, what would have been the point? But my sister called me again the other day. I know our mom's whole plan had made my sister see our mom in a different light (she and my other siblings were always treated better than I was). My mom was supposed to visit in January. Then it was March. Now it's October.  Apparently my mother, after years of alcohol and chain smoking, its starting to catch up to her. According to my sister, my mom's been using a mobility scooter and an oxygen tank for the past couple of months and cites that as the reason why our mom is having difficulty ""visiting"" me. My sister isn't sure that our mom would even be able to travel in October anyways.  I want to feel bad but I don't.

az648p,"This all went down about an hour ago and my wife is still crying in our bathroom with the door locked.  Backstory: We had our son (now 11 months old) while my wife is in residency. She took a few weeks off before giving birth, and then went back to work a few months after, while I transitioned my hours to part-time so that I could stay at home and raise our son. My mom moved in with us shortly after the birth in order to help out, which allows me to get in the few hours of work per day and also not get swamped with taking care of the baby/housework. She's quite old-fashioned and would definitely not prefer this arrangement with me being a stay-at-home dad, but she hasn't said anything to either of us and has been a great help. For anyone unfamiliar with medical residency, it is *brutal*. My wife has just over a year left. Sometimes she comes and goes for 1-3 days and our son is asleep the whole time she's home, which has been happening more as his sleep schedule shifted to sleeping through the night. My mom and I make sure that when she's home and the baby is awake, my wife gets him 100%. I know it's been hard on her, but unfortunately it's just going to be this way for another year. The first big milestone she missed was him rolling over. When she got home, my mom pulled her over to the baby all excited. I thought she was going to tell her, but instead she says ""Julie, you came home right on time! He's been moving about as if he's going to roll over!"" They both stood there encouraging him, and right on cue he rolls. My wife was *elated*. She was so worried and guilty about not being there and she took it as proof that she can still be a present mother while working.  So we continued. I send texts over little things she misses through the day so that it's not completely unbelievable, but my wife has been 'present' for every single BIG milestone. He coincidentally started crawling with her right there, his first words were in front of her, and he began standing, cruising, and walking when she happened to be home. The walking one was difficult- there was a tough 7 day stretch where she just wasn't home during the daytime when he was awake, and his walking went from teetering to walking a couple steps pretty confidently in that time. We put little beanbags in one of his pants pockets so he'd be wobbly and unbalanced and it looked believable since he fell after the first step like he was doing a week ago. Yes, it was mean to our poor son but my wife's face was worth it. Today it all unravelled. So far he can just say 'mama', 'dada' and 'nana'. Yesterday he started saying 'bye-bye'. My wife has today off and has been home all morning. My mom and I have been trying to get him to say bye all day without giving it away that we already know he can say bye. Successfully got him to say bye to the ducks at the park, and we both gushed over his newest word the whole way home. My wife was using my phone to take pictures of him and began showing my mom at home while telling her about his newest word acquisition. She was swiping through my gallery and saw a video from yesterday and goes ""oh you never sent me this one!"" It was literally like a slow motion film happening in front of my eyes. I had taken the video of him yesterday waving bye-bye. My wife isn't an idiot. She figured the whole ruse out pretty much instantly. I've never seen her look so upset and heartbroken before. I couldn't say or do anything to comfort her. Now she's locked herself in the bathroom crying and won't come out. I'm on our bed hoping someone can please tell me what to do to make this better. &#x200B; **tl,dr:** my mom and I lied to my wife about our son's milestones for months, and she just found out. &#x200B;",Oh god the title read as if you and your mom had a baby together and I was like dying so this didn’t seem as bad after thinking that,6206

So here's an update: After I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves. We pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually *had* been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, ""deluding herself into thinking she's actually home"", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife). Some things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear. We ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it. Thank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of *someone* in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true. tl;dr: marriage is work. I am stupid. We moved past it.","You guys are going to be just fine. You listen to each other, try to understand one another, and are able to express your feelings. Keep it up.",2993

I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn’t happy, I hadn’t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways.  The last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered.  I just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven’t felt in years, it’s like I’ve taken my first deep breath in a long time.  So, if you’re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don’t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you!  TLDR: I broke up with my codependent boyfriend and am the happiest I have been in years. ","This is so relatable to me. I broke up with my boyfriend of 8 years and while it was very hard to do, I feel so much better living on my own and working on figuring out who I am as an individual. I spent so long putting him and others first that I forgot to put myself first. It’s tough, but sometimes the hardest things are the right things to do. Best of luck to you!",3063

Despite a brief period of ""improvement"" he quickly went back to his habit of what I considered abusive tendencies. I joined a support group shortly after my original post. A few weeks after that my coworker walked into our shared office and found me crying at my desk...again. I've been friends with CW for a while, careful to talk as little about my home life as possible and for some reason that day I just broke. I let out years of feelings on the poor man and he just sat and listened. Him just being a kind human made me realize how bad I had let things get. Simple kindness is strange to me. People asking how I am and actually caring is a foreign concept that I distrust. I felt (and feel) stupid and pathetic. In the past month I felt myself very drastically distancing myself from my husband. He became suspicious, went through my phone, and read my Ejournal. He was furious when he read that I spoke to CW about my feelings, accused me of cheating, and threatened divorce. This time I just said ""fine"". So we're done. I moved into the guest room A few of the original commenters called BS on the autism excuse he used, they were right. A few nights after I moved into the guest room he stumbled in (very drunk) and said that he had been cheating on me. I don't even care if its true. The second I agreed to the divorce I just felt relieved. I also feel guilty for being relieved but the second I agreed, I realized his s\*\*t isn't my problem anymore. I'm made regular appointments with an abuse counselor at my college who's helping me sort through the nonsense I put myself through. I blame myself largely for enabling his behavior, maybe if I had tried harder to communicate earlier in our marriage we could have fixed it. Or if I had not been so afraid of the fighting and avoided raising issues, we could have made it. I'm not sure but it's not really relevant anymore. TL:DR: Original commenters called it, he just didn't care enough. Husband didn't change, threatened divorce again, I said ""fine"". We're over, and I just feel relieved. PS: Bought a lock for my bedroom door as well &#x200B; Small edit: I realized that I failed to mention a few things on why I'm staying in the house: We do have a daughter (9), and kids make things a little trickier. I am in an intense nursing program and only work (very) part time as a tutor. He works nights so our interactions are limited to the two days he has off. I leave before he gets home and when I'm getting home from school, he's out the door. I know it would be best to find a place to stay but the resources in this area are extremely limited. My college is literally in a cornfield. I also want to thank you all for the support, I have felt so lonely for months and to have strangers be so kind means a lot to me. I'm definitely going to download  that book, "" Why Does He Do That?"", and make the time to read it.  We were married for 10 years and one commenter did the easy math....Yeah I was 18 when we married, 17 when we met. I was fresh out of a physically abusive relationship, and he was so nice to me.  Again, the kindness and support means more to me than I can express, I'm determined to be a stronger person and trust myself again.",">I blame myself largely for enabling his behavior, maybe if I had tried harder to communicate earlier in our marriage we could have fixed it. Or if I had not been so afraid of the fighting and avoided raising issues, we could have made it.  Nope. It's more likely that abusers prey on people who are like you: people pleasers who want to go with the flow, who make up excuses when people treat them badly, who have porous boundaries that are consistently violated, and who are empathetic and desperately want to believe in the best of people so they give second, third, fourth chances.  Just like a lion on the plains can sense the weakest, slowest gazelle, so can abusive people sense potential victims. ",2395
b47frm,"Sorry, never posted here before and didn't know I needed a tl;dr (it is at the bottom). Reposting. &#x200B; I  used to work on a small team for a division of a multinational company.  We used to primarily be staffed by what were called “old timers”  basically people who were close to being of a pensionable age who didn’t  want the hustle. That culture shifted and a lot of young blood has been  brought in. I formerly worked there and was given a lateral move out. A  colleague “Tina” still works there. Recently an opening for Director  came up and Tina came to me for help. She's been doing overtime and working hard to get noticed for this position. She's well qualified for it and has extensive experience at the company, so she was given a chance to interview for it. Tina  is a single mother who has overcome poverty in childhood,  racists/bigots in the industry and worked hard to support her kids.  She’s had health issues but always fought hard. Tina is tenacious and  hardworking, but there are issues – she struggles in some areas and  while she’d definitely make a great director as she’s contentious, kind  and courteous, the role is evolving and may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, I helped her with her application and presentation. Beyond being colleagues, she and  I are friends; we spend a lot of time outside of work together (we’re  the only women of color in our respective areas) and share a lot of our  deep feelings and thoughts. She worked hard and put together a good  presentation. I was really proud of her. She presented this morning at  9:30 and got through it and was out by 10:00. Most  of the other applicants were internal and interviewed yesterday but one  person was recommended by a senior VP in a different department. The  guy who was recommended is a 30-year-old hot-shot (I think he may actually be in his late twenties). He will soon graduate  from an Ivy League MBA and is the definition of corporate style. They  gave him a last-minute presentation slot immediately following Tina. I  attended all of the presentations (I am not on the hiring committee) but  was there to support Tina and see how the presentations went. When  the hotshot gave his presentation, it wasn’t even close. The 20 of us  sat in the room and were dumbfounded. Not only was his presentation  visually appealing but he noticed details none of us ever did and he  developed a pitch that was so innovative that our AVP asked to use a tag  line he created. His technical analysis was so spot-on that it was  spooky. He understood issues facing our business unit without having to  be told and had ready solutions to solve the problems. Questions they  asked him were more about how he’ll do things *when*  he takes over the role. It was made very clear to him that this was his  job and they even provided an unofficial tentative start date. It is  very clear that he understands the industry and his past experiences,  such as professional work experience as well as winning top case  competitions and academic awards prepared him very well. The  presentations were in totally different leagues. After  he finished, he made a self-deprecating joke and took questions. He  thanked us and left. We all sat there for a minute chatting when the AVP  very loudly told the HR director to offer significantly above the  salary and hammer-out a start date immediately and get a contract  signed. The VP who recommended him knew him from the MBA program as the  VP is a case coach there. He said he’d be his reference and they are  skipping all the formalities and going right to the offer. Tina has no idea. She was so happy with her performance and she's *sure*  she nailed it. She did well, about as well as the other candidates, but  this guy is out-and-out in a different league. Just based on that I too  would hire the other guy. She's sitting on cloud 9 at her desk and  planning a celebratory dinner to celebrate her performance (she was told  decisions would be made in a couple of weeks). At this rate, it's  likely she'll be informed that she didn't get the job well before 5 PM. &#x200B; I  really don't know what to do or say. If she asks, should I be honest  about this guy's presentation? Should I avoid her the rest of the day? I  want to support her, but have no idea how to even begin talking to her. &#x200B; &#x200B; tl;dr Friend applied for a job she has worked towards for two years. She got proverbially destroyed in the interview but has no idea another candidate is going to get it. She's planning to celebrate tonight about her performance in the interview but will probably find out long before that she lost out. How can I support her?","I wouldn't tell her that she isn't getting the job, but I would give her a heads up that someone else had a really strong presentation, to the point where you aren't sure what they're going to do.  At least that way she'll be a little more emotionally prepared when the news comes.",3971

b5qsvw,"Before anyone says anything, I know how stupid this sounds. But hear me out.  I have my own home with her brother, and all three of our bedrooms and our only bathroom is upstairs. The only reason anyone has to be upstairs is to go to the toilet, or possibly to my daughter's room if their kid is playing there too.  I've noticed whenever my SIL comes over, she just walks on through to our room, which I kinda feel like is an invasion of privacy. All the clean laundry comes to our room, and if we have visitors we tuck away a few things in our room so it's invariably the messiest room in the house and the one we least want people in. But no matter what she's always in there, and seemingly for no reason at all. It's usually to 'see my paint colour' (it hasn't been painted in over a year) or 'see the cat' or 'look out the front window'. The worst was today - I came home from work early as I'm feeling ill. I knew she was coming over with her kids and my partner kindly said I could stay in bed and not worry about coming down to be sociable etc, especially with the kids over it's a lot when you have a headache. He said he just wasn't gonna mention I was home at all because the kids would come try and chat and play if they knew I was here. So I'm listening to them play in the next room and SIL comes up to check on them and sees they are all fine. THEN SHE OPENS MY BEDROOM DOOR. I've stuck my head under the covers and she hovers then closes it again. Wtf?? Why is she always opening my bedroom door like what is she expecting to see?  I just feel like because we're all adults it's an unspoken boundary, you don't just hit up someone's bedroom without having an invite to come see or a legit reason.  Am I weird for thinking this is irritating and not being able to make any sense out of it? Also I know that everyone is going to suggest I just talk to her about it but how awkward is that? 'Yo I know you're in you're 30s now but please stay out of my room?'. I have tried in the past to hint that I hate having folk in there because that's where all my laundry goes for ironing and all the spare toys get stored to create extra play room.

I explained how it makes me anxious to come back home to a messy place and would rather keep it tidy as I go, specially if It’s when leaving the house and I’m not late for any commitments. &#x200B; I also brought up that I thought it would be good for him to live by himself before we could consider living together. I explained that I used to be very messy when I first moved out of my parents house but with time learned the value of a tidy and clean space in which to feel relaxed. He thought about it and a while after said he thought I was right and he would like to have a go at living by himself, saying he was very excited even thinking about it. &#x200B; In the days after the talk his attitude changed completely too. At times I would leave for work and he would stay at my house to do some other chores or come and pick me up earlier and take the bins out. He started spending more time at my house after this and we became much closer in the following months. &#x200B; In September R started a new job and for logistical reasons we could not spend the night together unless we were both on a day off the following day (he works Monday-Friday and I work 4 shifts on 4 off). We would go a whole week without seeing each other for more than an hour or two, which was really abnormal for us. We started to make a big effort to meet up at any spare 15 minutes between our jobs and other commitments. Sometimes one of us would drive to the other one after work just to say hi for 10 minutes and then leave. It really showed how much we cared about the relationship. &#x200B; Around this time I was looking for a new house as i had a raise at my job and could afford to live somewhere on my own as opposed to a shared house. I went to see a flat that was perfect for me. Ticked all the boxes, including budget. The only thing was that as soon as I saw it all I could think of was how it wasn’t to be just mine but mine and R’s. &#x200B; That evening we sat down and I told him about the flat and what I thought as soon as I saw it. I explained how the efforts we had both put in the relationship over the last few months proved to me that we had a relationship worth cherishing. He asked me for some time to think about it and eventually said he too thought we should move in together. R said he didn’t feel like he needed to live alone to “discover himself”. We then sat down and wrote a list of things we would look for in a place, including a budget and how much we would need to spend on furniture, etc. &#x200B; **( edit:** this note now hangs in our bedroom wall as a sign of how we dreamed this house, planned it and accomplished it together. ) &#x200B; By this time I had decided to forget about the perfect flat I saw and we decided to look for another place together. A few weeks go by and the agency calls me to say the flat I had seen a month before was still available and the landlord had lowered the rent.

I went through more therapy to be absolutely certain that I needed the medication. My therapist used the same multiple choice test on my feelings and symptoms twice (pre-test and post-test) to determine that nothing had changed/gotten better really over the course of 3 months or so. I began taking 10mg a day of an antidepressant and sensed a change fairly quickly. It took 3-4 weeks to fully kick in, but I think I started feeling it around 2 weeks. I am so much happier than before and I do not think about my life ending 3-5 times a week anymore. Now that I write that, I rarely think about it at all now. The things that used to seem like mountains are now just little mole hills. I cannot fully express how I wish I would have considered taking medication earlier. I feel like I wasted years of my life being so disgustingly unhappy. &#x200B; Just earlier this week I broke up with Eli because I will be moving away for a job and I was no longer happy with the way the relationship was going. I still care about him immensely, and because I care about him so much I knew it was best to cut things off if I could not see the relationship progressing further after 3 years of dating. &#x200B; I'm super excited to start a new chapter in my life! &#x200B; **TLDR: Took meds, broke up with boyfriend.

ba520r,"This sub has really changed my life.  I don't know how to express my gratitude, but hopefully this update will let you all know what you do here really matters. When I started seeing M, I became obsessed with this subreddit.  I would read it several times a day.  Part of me knew what was happening wasn't right, but I felt like I needed outside perspective.   My mother told me growing up to never speak ill of your partner.  So I lied to my friends and even my therapist about what was happening.  I thought it was wrong to say anything bad about M.  I only posted anonymously here. I needed to read a lot of stories and hear a lot of comments before I understood relationships aren't supposed to be like what I had with M.  I would read a story and see dozens of commenters call a relationship abusive when that hadn't been my takeaway.  It made me realize I might not recognize what abuse is. I started researching abuse and learned that name calling, threatening suicide, isolation from friends and family, and telling you no one else will ever love you are abusive behaviors.  I know some people will say that's obvious, but it was so much less abusive than what I saw growing up that I thought it was fine. I opened up to my therapist and she confirmed that all of these behaviors I thought were acceptable were abuse.  I broke up with M. It was terrifying to learn that I have literally no clue what a healthy relationship is.  But it probably saved my life.  I was with a man who CHOKED ME IN PUBLIC and I thought the problem was me.  I can't imagine what might have happened if I'd stayed. My therapist and I are working on medicating my PTSD and exploring what healthy romantic relationships look like.  I'm having a hard time unpacking the abuse because I'm still learning what abuse is, but I'm talking openly and honestly. Thank you, Reddit. Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9y8b3b/m33_disregards_my_f32_overt_boundaries/ TL,DR: My ex was abusive and I didn't realize it until Reddit made me realize relationships aren't supposed to hurt so much.

bbbfo8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i34pr/me_31_f_with_my_husband_35_m_married_2_years/ It took me 3 more years, but I finally left him last year. This post helped me see how much was wrong in our relationship, but I was still so hesitant to leave. We had pets and a beautiful home together and I loved his family and we had so many inside jokes and plans for the future. But eventually it was all just too much for me to take any longer. The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years. I moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats. **I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.** I told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing. I'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible. I met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me. **If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.** It gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog. But I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence. Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay. tl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better. EDIT: for those saying it didn’t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year.  If you think you are too old or too much trouble or have too much baggage or are too much anything, please believe that it is possible to find love again. Both loving yourself and having someone else love you ",I'm so glad you left and are in a better place. Good job. :),1579

So this wasn’t a terribly popular post but I just wanted to share the happy ending.  The evening after I wrote this post, I went over to his house after work and we hung out and ate and stuff. While we were just laying on the bed, he faced me and said “baby, there anything I can do to be better for you?”. It was the perfect opportunity to share how I felt about that. So I just went ahead and said “idk if you know you still do this but you check out a lot of people when we’re out together. Mostly woman and I worry that it sexualises them and it makes me uncomfortable.” He seemed a little fake surprised and was like “really? Oh I didn’t know I did it so much and so obviously.” I didn’t want to push the agenda so much because I know he’s a thinker and will think about it even if we don’t discuss it further. The next day, we were on our way back to his house and there was a girl walking towards us who was quite beautiful. I saw him glance at her then he turned and looked at me and I was already looking at him and we both burst into laughter. I said to him that I see that he’s struggling and we just laughed it off but he very clearly got the message because since then I haven’t seen any overt staring at both men and women. Thank you to everyone who gave me to confidence to deal with this head on. TLDR managed to speak to my bf about this issue and I’ve seen effort from him dealing with him","Unfortunately we all notice attractive people, but it’s all in how you react to it. It sounds like he’s more aware of it and if he can be more aware that a few moments of checking someone out is not worth the insecurity you will feel, then I think you’ll be all right!   I really like how receptive he was to this though. This is a good sign for future communication! My husband and I have been together eight years and have had to have some uncomfortable conversations but it’s all in how you approach it and how you react to their response.",2347
bctq5b,"One of my work colleagues is a lifelong friend of mine. We lived on the same street growing up, went to the same school and when I needed a job after graduating university, she made me aware of an opening at the company she worked at. I applied, got the job, and it's been quite a few years since and we still work together. It's a pretty small company, and quite male-dominated, so after we started working together we became really close. We take all our lunches together, we regularly stop by each other's desks for a chat, and we quickly became known round the office as inseparable. A year ago she got engaged to her long term partner, and I was ecstatic for her. She had a really tough time a couple of years ago (two family deaths close together) and I did everything I could to be a good friend to her while she was in the worst stages of grieving. She cried with me daily for weeks and I made sure she knew I was always available to listen. I also took about a third of her workload off her voluntarily, so she could take days off when she needed to without stressing about her work building up. So now that life has gotten better for her and she's always smiling and excited, it's really nice to see. Ever since she got engaged, as expected, she's talked a lot about wedding plans, especially at our lunches. I know basically every detail. When she booked her venue she was really excited, but she refused to tell me where it was going to be, saying that she wanted it to be a surprise when the invitations came out. The wedding is two weeks away now, and I've long since stopped waiting for my invitation to show up. I know when they were sent because she told me all about delivering them, and shows me every day the gifts people have started to buy off their registry. I feel silly for saying it, but the more I think about it, the more hurt I feel that I haven't been included. It's a big wedding, and she has invited some other people from work that I didn't know she was even close to. She hasn't mentioned the reason why I'm not invited, and at this point I feel too awkward to ask. I guess it's just a slap in the face because I really thought we were close, and now I'm realising that maybe we're not. The trouble is, since all this I've started to really examine our friendship, and I'm wondering if she even cares about me at all. I can think of a hundred examples of where I've helped her work through decisions, listen to her vent, stood up for her when she's had issues with colleagues etc. Even tons of little things, like if anyone brings in cake and she's out of the office I always save her a slice so she doesn't miss out. But I can't remember a time that she did anything for me in return. Now when she talks to me, I've realised she doesn't even listen to me. When I'm finished talking she just carries on with what she was saying before, almost as if I'd never spoken at all. If we're ever talking about me or something I've been doing, she never has anything to say. She just kind of nods and then switches the conversation back to herself. I'm starting to think she couldn't care less about me, she just likes having someone around who she can talk at, and whoever that person is doesn't really matter to her. I've invested so many years into this friendship, it's really cut me deep. I feel used. It's also made being at work incredibly lonely, because she was my only friend. I've stopped having lunch with her and any time she tries to chat I politely bring the conversation to a quick end and go back to work. She doesn't appear to have even noticed. I do still wish her well, I'm still glad for her that life has turned around and she's so happy, but I'm a bit lost. I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh because I'm hurt, or if I even have the right to feel hurt in the first place, as I know weddings have a finite number of guests and you have to leave people out that you would invite in an ideal world. But I'm not sure there's any way back from this either. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Am I being unreasonable or overdramatic? Should I just let the dust settle and see how I feel then? Edit 1: Just to clarify things that have been asked a lot or requested to be put in an edit - 1) She hand delivered the invites to other people at work so I know it hasn't been lost in the post 2) I haven't asked her about it because I'm a total doormat and scared of difficult conversations and 3) I invited her to my wedding, but that was years ago so it's possible she thinks things have changed since then. Edit 2: This has got a lot more attention than I expected, and my first ever gold from a kind stranger, thank you! I have read every single comment, thank you all so much for taking the time to give me advice. You have given me A LOT to think about. Opinion seems to be divided over whether or not I should confront the wedding invitation issue or just let it go. I am definitely going to make sure that it isn't a mistake, but as for getting an explanation why she didn't invite me I'm undecided. I'm going to have a think about that and the best way to proceed, but your thoughts have all been really helpful. In terms of our friendship in general, I'm not going to be too hasty to write it off. I'm going to try and put my feelings aside and see if I'm right about it being one-sided. If it is then I will have learned a good life lesson, and if I see it as worth saving then I'll have to deal with that the best way I can. It does seem the bigger issue here is my non-confrontational approach to my relationships. Some of your comments were hard to read but only because I know you're right and this is something I have to change. I've withdrawn from friendships before because they've hurt me and I've felt unable to say anything, and that's not really fair. It's a general problem I have with uncomfortable conversations. Whenever I have to have them I basically descend into a panic, my mouth goes dry, I shake and I can't find the right words to say. If it's a bad enough problem that I can't ask a good friend a simple question then I can't ignore it any more and I need to work on this. Thank you for pointing this out to me as a real problem, I'm going to find a way to get better at it. I will post an update of what happens, thank you again! TL;DR My best work friend didn't invite me to her wedding, and since then I've started to question our entire friendship. I think it's permanently damaged everything we had, and I'm feeling really hurt, lost, and unsure of how to proceed.","Why don’t you ask her why you didn’t get an invite? If you thought of her as one of your close friends, seems like it would be worth the effort.",5728
bdxw27,"OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\_30f\_want\_to\_discuss\_moving\_in\_with\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/) Thanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week. As mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, ""Well did you want to? My lease is up in July."" and he said that he did. It was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position. We ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me! He keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :) **TL;DR:** Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June! **Edit:** Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing. Many people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)","Congrats! My SO and I did something similar, and I wanted to pass on something I wish I'd learned sooner: if you don't have a rental contract, you should put a utility bill in your name. You'll need that credit history, and it will come in handy for legal identification purposes (like if your state requires a copy of a utility bill, rental agreement, or mortgage in order to get a new driver's license).",2096
beku6e,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)    So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation.  I started by saying: ""So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?"" She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road.  When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now.  She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for.  I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress.  So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons: 1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.   2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an ""issue"" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.    3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.  And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend. Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally.  I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return. She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on. She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best. It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now. The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with.  If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain.  I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people.  I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me.  Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me. Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear. I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that. &#x200B; TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way. Edit: A few people have been asking about the books I was recommended: Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg When I Say No I Feel Guilty by Manuel J Smith Why Men Love Bitches by Sherry Argov","It takes a really mature, good person to step away from the hurt you are obviously feeling and just let it be for the sake of someone too selfish to do the same. I hope you find friends that are deserving of you. I'm glad that you are feeling better about the situation and I wish you all the best!",9493
bgh020,"My husband [30M] and I [28M] have a 6 week old baby daughter. I am currently a stay at home dad and taking on most of the childcare. Occasionally my MIL has been helping me out but it has been causing a lot more stress than usual since she has been staying over and sleeping in our guest room. Those past weeks we have been dealing a lot with baby colic. She has been difficult to comfort unless I hold her and she does get very upset when my MIL holds her. My MIL is a lovely woman but you can't explain that to a baby. I have been trying to explain to MIL that I appreciate her help around the house a lot, feeding times, laundry (baby's clothes). I have been telling her that but when it comes to the baby crying her head off I'd appreciate if she let's me hold her. When I tell her that, especially when the baby is crying and clearly wants me to hold her, my MIL gets visibly upset. Close to crying even because she thinks I'm pushing her granddaughter away from her.  This mainly comes from her refusing to respect that I don't want her to kiss the baby on her lips, which is a disgusting habit my SIL also participates in. My MIL invites my SIL over as well to coo over the baby despite my daughter crying because of colic and overstimulation. She's not used to any of this.  My husband is not backing me up on this because of course it's his mother so now I have to talk to her without causing a rift. Tl;dr MIL and SIL do not respect boundaries regarding my daughter of 6 weeks. If this continues I'd rather exclude them for a while. How can we fix this?","Your problem isn't your MIL or SIL, it's your partner.  You need to sit him down and have this out with him.  He then needs to handle his family.",3475
bi050t," Hello my friends near and far, I have never really used this before, so I apologize immensely for being unaware of certain posting criteria! I hope you are all doing well, and I thank you for taking the time to read this post!  I have been with my partner for 7 years, we initially met online, and after meeting in person a few times, and realizing our affection for one another, we found it promising to move in together. I moved from California to Pennsylvania to be with him throughout graduate school. All was seemingly well during this time. I have never really had any reason to not trust him. I encouraged him to very much so, to try his best to make friends, or to explore hobbies on his own outside of the various ones we share, because I have my own passions, and I found we connected most when we met in the middle through conversations about these passions, through the act of explaining or showcasing what we've taken in or learned.   Throughout these 7 years, he has struggled with very low self esteem, and though I don't necessarily think of myself as the pillar of self love, the depth of mine doesn't reach the low perception of his self value. Because of this, he has seen and stopped seeing, both a counselor, and a therapist, and has been on medication to help for the last 6 months.  Things where seemingly well between us, and continued to be pretty fluid. We continued to share things, and take long walks, and where pretty open ended about where we stood in the relationship, if one was feeling a bit of an ebb, the other would pick up more of a share, and vice versa.   However, things took a bit of a dip about 2 days ago, when I felt the ebb, and asked him about it. Initially, he said there was really nothing wrong, and perhaps I was just feeling this way because with our schedules we haven't been able to see one another for long periods of time like we are used to, which is true. But the feeling continued to irk me, and when I asked about it a second time, he confessed to me, he had begun talking to another girl from another country, via Instagram direct messages, and though things between she and him never crossed the boundaries of platonic friendship, he really loved the initial rush of someone asking him questions about his favorite movie, his favorite album, his favorite book, all things he and I already know very well about one another. I asked if he'd sent any selfies, or anything, risqué, and he said no, though I can't confirm, because he deleted the messages, a good deal of me believes him, because of how open he was about the initial conversations to begin with. We slept apart, and I just felt really confused the entire night, because I couldn't really resonate with wanting that sort of attention from someone else. If anything, his yearning for that type of attention, sort of hurt. It felt like I wasn't doing enough, or giving enough.  The next morning, though I don't have an Instagram, and am not on the app, I went to check his using the desktop version, and found that posts where he once called me 'the love of his life' or a specific post with a gift I gave him that once said 'greatest gift from the greatest girl' where still on his profile, but the words, 'girlfriend' or 'love of my life' where completed erased. With this realization, my confusion and hurt turned to very real heartache. I called him and asked if he had deleted these words from the specific posts, and with shame, he said yes he did. When I asked why, he said it was because he just didn't want the attention from the girl asking him about himself to be disrupted if she found out he was in a long term relationship. I guess this is where, I asked the obvious and questioned why someone who is just asking about your favorite books, movies, etc, would be driven away by the fact that you have a girlfriend. And he said he didn't know why he did it, and that it was a massive mistake.  At the risk of seeming toxic, and I will take full accountability for seeming so or being so, I asked him to please deactivate his Instagram for the time being while we sort through this, his twitter as well. He did, and though I was feeling a bit of relief about that, I couldn't help but feel a bit saddened that he didn't choose to do that on his own for the benefit of our relationship, he had to wait for me to ask. Which again, just made me feel like such a toxic and controlling partner. Two things I always strive to be so far from.  When he got home from work, we discussed everything at massive length, and he continued to swear up and down, that these conversations pertained strictly to music, movies, and books, and he didn't have interest in her, just interest in the initial rush of the attention he was receiving. We read a few articles, and he broke things down to me as his self esteem has never been lower, despite his career as a doctor being at a high, and his finances in order, he felt things with his music weren't taking off, and with that came a feeling that he wasn't special, and it was nice for someone to make him feel that way. I felt shame and asked him if I wasn't doing enough or giving enough to him to make him feel that way, he said, I defiantly was, but my love, and attention and affection, became a pillar he could rely on, and got used to, so with new attention came a rush, and he liked that.   I asked him if he wanted to be single, and find that rush in dating new people, and he kept insisting that that's so far from what he wants. He wants to remain a couple, and do all he can to work on these things together. Though I can't help but correlate that feeling he enjoys with the feeling of a first date. Which hurts of course. I told him I didn't really see how we could move past this because there was nothing much for me to make an attempt to work on moving forward. This seems to be a self stemming problem, that I emphasize with, but just don't want to be on the receiving end of the counter effects.   So though it is incredibly uneasy to begin to think of how difficult it'll be to begin again, it is just as difficult to think about how difficult it would be to stay and try to rebuild back up an issue that I feel like just a bystander when it comes to.   This has all been very painful and if this comes to an end I just want it to be as civil and as possible. He deserves to love himself, but not at the expense of the love we have between us. I deserve love that is stable and comforting, and not laced with newfound paranoia.   Despite this all, my heart is still very much in this of course, and he has been very vocal about how it was just one mistake, nothing happened, we can work through this, etc. And I secretly keep hoping he will make a step, any step really, to showcase these words and implement action, seek a new therapist, find the two of us a relationship counselor, buy a book on self help or on how couple conquer affairs, anything, anything at all, without me having to be the one to ask him. I just want him to have that yearning that he continues to say he has, but instead of saying it, I was him to show me.   Do you think that makes me irrational or just plain dumb? I believe to be in a state where I can handle either answer. Or something completely different just the same!  Do you all think I'm blowing something completely out of proportion? Given how this was an exchange of conversation between him and another girl for just a few days, and his erasure of me on his profile was only for about 2 days?   Alas, we have come to the very end of this post, if you've made it, I can not thank you enough for giving me your time, if you take the time to post, I can not thank you enough for giving me your efforts. This has been a first in this relationship, this has been a first in my life truthfully, and throughout writing this I just felt completely vulnerable and isolated. So, if you've given me your time, thank you, thank you, thank you! I hope what happened to me, doesn't happen to you, and wish you all things gracious and good and completely fulfilling my friends! Best of luck, and all of my love and gratitude.  TL;DR I've been in a relationship for 7 years, my partner recently and unexpectedly kept posts on Instagram that showcased us as a couple but deleted the words beneath them that included the words 'love of my life' and 'girlfriend' in order to continue to receive attention from another girl who lives in another country, who he says he shared a platonic relationship with via Instagram direct messages, and really only enjoyed the aspects of her asking him questions about his favorite things and giving him validation. He says he only erased those specific words in order to keep the flow of validation coming. He doesn't want to end things or see other people, I am a bit unsure about where to go or what to do.","You seem like a pretty smart person, so remember things we learned in school as kids. Actions are more important than words. Saying sorry and being sorry are 2 different things. If he was actually sorry, he'd understand the social media thing is a symptom of a problem he has. He's refusing to even treat the SYMPTOMS of the problem, let alone the actual problem. And you're focusing on the symptom as well. The guy was happy to basically delete you from  his life for some attention. What does that mean in other contexts? How far would the logic that took him there actually take him to go?",2462
bio854,"My wife left me on April 9. She came home from work early for the first time in months, said we needed to talk then said we love each other, we care for each other and we’ve never had a lack of affection, but that she’s unhappy and she’s leaving me. She packed a bag while I was trying to talk to her and she left.  We’ve been together for nearly 10 years. Nothing happened. We weren’t fighting, no skeletons in closets, she didn’t meet somebody else. We’ve both been digging in and trying to get through the grind lately but she did this completely out of the blue. She’s barely talked to me since. She never replies to me, only comes with prepared statements, says them (writes them) and ghosts again without actually talking to me.  All I can think is that last October her dad died and they were extremely close and it has been really hard on her. I’ve been trying to help as much as I can, I encouraged her to go to a therapist and tried to make her feel loved and comforted at home but instead she’s been throwing herself into work nonstop for probably 6 months at this point. I’m talking 6 am until 9 pm every day.    She’s not only pushing me out but she’s pushed anyone who asks about us away too. From what I’ve been able to gather from mutual friends she’s working even harder now, and destroying her reputation at work while she’s at it because she’s micromanaging everyone.  Since she left I’ve been asking her to go to couples therapy with me but she won’t. She refuses to even try and save the relationship. She said it’ll just hurt like this again when it happens next time, but I can’t convince her that there doesn’t have to be a next time. That no matter what we aren’t the same people we were before she left me and that if we try and work together we can grow from this and be stronger. She can’t see any of it and I’m afraid she’s completely ignoring what she’s doing by working so much she can’t think about anything else.  I hoped her mom could talk her down but she threw me under the bus the second she realized if she pushed back my wife would cut her out, despite the fact I took a lot of time off of work last year to help her after the funeral and after she had some surgeries. My wife’s best friend from work and another of her close friends messaged me separately and both said she’s not acting like herself but they can’t say anything to her or she’ll push them out too. It’s like everyone is just giving her room to self destruct. I keep telling myself it’s going to be ok, she’s going to realize she doesn’t have to do this, but it’s been 20 days and I’m starting to lose hope. I don’t know what to do. I have my finances in order I know what I can and can’t do on my own, but I can’t leave because I’m not giving up on her but every day I wake up surrounded by the cold remains of “us” and it hurts so bad I can hardly breathe.  Tl;dr my wife is having a depressive episode (I think) and left me. Edit - I think I might have misrepresented what I'm doing. I've cut contact. I'm not spamming her or trying to make her talk to me anymore. The first few days I tried everything I could think of, but I do respect that she needs space and I've since cut all contact unless I absolutely have to talk to her and even then it's only about logistics. I've examined my financial situation and I've made plans on how to move forward and I plan on doing it. I'm going to the gym to help with the anxiety and stress, I'm eating healthier, and I'm trying to find a therapist for myself. I'm doing everything I can to actually move on and get through this. The problem is just that I feel a lot of guilt about, what if she's actually in crisis and I leave. Everyone else is ready to just let her self destruct so they can pick up the pieces later and I feel like that's not what she needs. The other side is she won't let me help so I don't have a choice but to go and that hurts too. I also know I'm being unfair to her mother and friends in this post. I have told them all during our separate conversations that I understand why they're doing what they're doing but it still hurts all the same. I do want them to be there for her if she'll let them. Also -- I 1000% agree that this is very one sided. I'm literally just saying what I understand to be happening and I fully accept that I don't know her reasons for doing this and that's part of what makes this so hard. I thought we were good at communicating to one another but apparently I thought wrong or something changed and took that communication with it and I didn't see it.",Wow. Well she sounds very determined. I guess get some therapy/support just for you to make sure if what you think.  Then prepare? You feel blindsided and want to get her back? Or move on?,3534
bjhxpk,"My fiance and I are getting married over the summer (we've been together 4 years). We decided on a very informal courthouse wedding and the two of us decided to elope/honeymoon internationally after. Well, this was heartbreaking to our parents and my mom threw a fit and tried to bargain and bully her way into getting her way. I gathered all of my strength from the spirit of past r/relationships posts and put my foot down. I had a change of heart a few months later though.  I have a good relationship with my MIL and I wanted her to be able to see us get married. Fiance and I decided to invite the parents for the weekend of our courthouse wedding. We planned some photos and simple dinner and THAT'S IT. My mom of course took this as an invitation to start planning a wedding for us with a fancy cake and extravagant dinner. I just let her make these plans and not acknowledging them, instead reiterating my own. It seems to be working so far, except when it comes to the dress. Backstory: My mom has always used money as a tool for emotional manipulation. Even when I was a child, she would spend her ""last dollars"" on something and bring it up FOREVER. She would talk about how she was poor and didn't have any clothes without holes in them because of me and my medical bills or things that I ""wanted"".  She would tell people on the street that she couldn't afford a haircut or dental work because of me. I separated myself from my parents financially as soon as I got to college and have a lot of debt as a result. I really couldn't handle the constant guilt trips even if it meant working full-time my freshman year. I stopped asking for anything at a young age and I still have a huge aversion to asking anyone for anything or receiving gifts. A few years ago, my parents took a page from Wesley Snipes' book and are now in a pretty bad financial situation. This makes my mom even more of a martyr when she sends me (unsolicited) gifts. The first time I told her about the wedding, she said, ""I don't have any money, but the dress is MINE!"" meaning she would buy it for me. She talked up the experience and is clearly looking forward to shopping with me. I don't mind the shopping aspect, but I don't want her to make this all about the sacrifice she made for my ""special day"". I will literally have to hear about this for the rest of her life  -  ""Remember when I spent my last few pennies on your dress. I had to eat rice for a month afterward and I couldn't afford my medication, but you looked so lovely!"" I don't want to think about how much of a fucking narcissist my mom is every time I look at my wedding photos. I started doing some preliminary online shopping and found sample dress on sale for $100 down from $500! I ordered it and it's arriving today. Assuming it fits and looks okay, this is the one.  Here's the problem: My mom is coming to visit for the first time in a year and dress shopping is at the top of her list. I'm so stressed out about what to say. I know I need to tell her that I bought a dress already, but I really just want to lie or avoid this whole situation. Anyone who's dealt with a narcissist knows how she's going to turn this around on me so I'm the asshole, and blow this whole thing out of proportion.  I never really developed a healthy relationship or mechanisms to deal with her and I just avoid situations like these to keep peace. My best idea so far was to tell her I found the dress at Goodwill. What's wrong with me??? I know I need to tell her, but what's the best way to approach this with the least amount of explosion? How do I stand up for myself without being a total dick? I believe in speaking my mind and doing what you want, I just don't want to deal with this fallout. TL;DR:  I'm still a child at nearly 30 who is scared to tell her mom that she bought a dress.","You know your mom is an N, so why are you letting her come visit you? Why are you letting her ignore your wishes and plan a giant reception for you? Why are you lying and covering and walking on eggshells? Nothing you do or tell her will make her happy. Because that is who she is. Unless everything is done her way, she will be abusive. So it's up to you to stop hiding in the shadows and just live your truth. You are not a dependent scared little girl anymore. You are 29 years old and you are allowed to do what you want with your wedding. You tell her that you found a great dress and purchased it. If she rages, you ask her to leave. If she refuses to leave, you call the cops. Don't put up with this bullshit anymore. Don't live in fear. Live authentically and if she wants to get on board and be a part of your life, she will have to adapt.",2623
bjikho,"Original post: [https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o8r2i/stepmom45f\_acts\_like\_im19f\_the\_other\_woman/](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o8r2i/stepmom45f_acts_like_im19f_the_other_woman/) &#x200B; Two years after posting this, I can safely say that my family is irreparably fractured. My relationship with my Dad is never going to be the same; in fact, there may not even be a relationship. My younger step-brother (7) has been largely poisoned against me by his Mom. My sister (19) mostly stays away from my Dad's home because it is so uncomfortable. My other sister (14) feels the need to create even more drama, just so she can get a scrap of attention. It has gotten so unbearable that I don't even feel sane anymore. &#x200B; When I wrote my last post, I really thought there was a solution to my stepmom's behavior. I had many calm discussions with my Dad where we talked about how damaging stepmom's behavior is. Over time those discussions have gotten more heated and mean. We had gone over it over and over and over to the point that I feel like a broken record. Every time we talked about the issue, he would acknowledge that her behavior is terrible (not in those words because he can't say anything bad about her) and tell me that he didn't know why ""she is like this"". &#x200B; I'd ask him why she never liked me over and over again. ""Why did she never try to get to know me? Why is she so cold? What the hell did I do to deserve this?"" are the questions I asked him pretty much every time I saw him. He never had an answer. All he could say in her defense was the he could see ""both sides"" (even though the issue started when I was a fucking kid and did absolutely nothing) and that she was so stressed because she had to clean up and sometimes no one would eat her dinner. Which is an absolute joke because when I raised my younger sisters by myself starting at age 13, they did the exact same thing to me. My 13 year old self NEVER treated them anywhere close to the way stepmom treats me. &#x200B; I even tried confronting the source of the problem a few times, but it never helped. It probably made things worse. She would just deny any responsibility for her actions and act like I was absolutely insane. It always devolved into shouting because I would get unimaginably frustrated that no one cared or recognized the borderline abuse. And the terrible part is there was nothing that I could really confront her about. There isn't one big thing that she's done; just 7 years of acting like I am not my father's daughter and like she was the victim of a hate crime. It is so hard to put that into words when someone asks you what exactly stepmom has done that is so irredeemable. I would much prefer that she had done something big; knowing someone hates you but will never show it in any other way than coldness is so much worse to me than anger. &#x200B; It got much worse when I had to move back home about 6 months ago because of my financial situation. Also note that I am not freeloading. I have a full time job, I pay my own car bill, I rarely eat their food due to stress-induced appetite loss, I buy all my own clothes, pay for everything related to my dog, and until it got bad I paid rent in the form of using my lunch break to drive my sister home from school (10ish miles from home). And I swear, when I moved in I tried so hard to make things better. I tried so fucking hard to be her friend. But she has just hid away in her room for the majority of the past 6 months, avoiding me. There were some times when it was ok, we'd have friendly conversation, but it never lasted more than a few weeks. I'd either do something unknown to upset her, or she would do something that upset me. 7 years of tension would just bubble over any time anything happened. &#x200B; 3 months ago, I stopped trying with her. I realized no matter what, she will always hate me. There is no relationship to be had with my stepmom. Ever. And it made me so angry that my Dad didn't care how much I was hurting. He didn't care that the situation made me feel like I was back in that house with my abusive Mom, 13 years old and utterly powerless. So not only did I stop trying, I started being kind of mean. Every time she said something passive aggressive, I'd rudely call her out. Not like it mattered anyway since she rarely talked to me, but I stopped talking to her. I made sure to leave as much as my stuff in the way as much as possible. I stopped doing anything to help stepmom and Dad during my work hours (8-5 M-F, I work from home and used to use my lunch break to drive my sister home from school). I rarely ate her dinners. Stuff like that. &#x200B; I'm not necessarily proud of my behavior, but I'm not ashamed either. I hate being mean and it actually doesn't make me feel any better, but I also refuse to just keep ignoring how she treats me. I just wanted something to be different, you know? I didn't care if it made things worse because then maybe someone would finally help me. No one did. My Dad and I began to grow apart and now I have a hard time seeing how he can love me and still let this go on for years. &#x200B; And last night, he let it slip my stepmom is trying to manipulate him into kicking me out. She evidently told him she would move out--OF HER OWN FUCKING HOUSE--just to get away from me. It's the most manipulative thing she has ever done. And it absolutely broke my fucking heart to hear that 1. someone hates me that much and 2. that my own father didn't think that was unacceptable thing to say. Yes, for the past 3 months I have not been nice, but I have not been evil. I have certainly not done anything she herself hasn't done for years. There is nothing wrong with me and I have to keep reminding myself of that. I have certainly done nothing to deserve her making my Dad choose between his daughter and his wife. The conversation ended with me reminding him that under state law, he can't kick me out unless he wants to go through eviction proceedings. I never want it to come to that, I only mentioned it because I have a dog that I am responsible for and I will not let her live on the streets. And that's where we left it. &#x200B; The past few weeks have made me realize that he will never stand up for me. He will never admit that there is nothing that made his wife hate me other than her own crazy. He will never admit that she 100% started this situation out of jealousy or something else when I was a kid. He will never admit it's not my fault (except the escalation that happened when I moved in, something I freely admit I 100% had a big part it). He will never leave her, even though in desperation I have asked him how he could love someone that hated his daughter so much. He won't even admit that my mother abused me for 10+ years, even though the state literally took his children away from her and the investigative report done by CPS was the most scathing, one-sided report that judge had ever seen. He will never love me enough to protect me, and it's devastating. &#x200B; Thank you for reading this very long update. I am about 90% sure I have a place lined up to move within the next week. I will be leaving this house and never coming back unless their marriage ends. I still love my Dad but I am so disappointed in him. I'm not cutting contact out of anger, I'm cutting contact because it is too painful to have my Dad prove to me every single day that he doesn't care how bad anyone treats me. &#x200B; tl;dr: stepmom has ruined my family and I don't think it is fixable.","Your dad has utterly failed you. I would tell him so, and that would be the last time we spoke. You need to move out and focus on building a life separate from them. They are weak, toxic, evil people.",3794
bk7hn9,"Hi everyone, I'm finding all this very overwhelming so I will keep it short. They have been our shared friendship group since we got together 8 years ago. I've had a disability for about three years.  I recently found out three members have tried to convince my fiance to leave me on multiple occasions, purely due to my disability. They basically said they don't see the point of staying with a disabled person and they want him to be happy. He assured them each time he is happy and it is his choice to stay with me.  They are all acting as though it is normal that they would try to convince him to leave, and that I'm overreacting by being upset. They've also stated they wanted ""what was best for both of us"" which I think was pretty obviously not true. I'm just trying to get some clarity here because I'm feeling very confused and worthless. I have myself given my fiance the option of leaving many times and said i wouldn't blame him, but he always said he wanted to stay. Is their behaviour normal? Is it OK for me to be upset? Thanks in advance Tl;dr : group members have tried to convince my partner to leave me due to my disability. Is that normal, and is it OK for me to feel upset. Edit: a lot of people seem to be interested in precisely what the disability is. As explained below it is rare enough that given the friends in question are redditors I think it would possibly stop the post being fully anonymous. To answer in depth questions: it is a physical disability, no it is not at all weight related, I am following all the medical guidelines possible regarding healing though not everything is known about this condition. Yes I am trying my best, no I am never abusive towards him, yes I am able to emotionally support him when he needs it. Yes he has to help me physically sometimes for example pushing my wheelchair and making the majority of meals. No it is not expected to get worse over time although nobody can know for sure. Yes he has to emotionally support me too when anxiety or grief about this condition get to me. Hopefully that now gives everyone enough information to go off. Edit 2: thank you for all the lovely validating replies. It is nice to know not everyone thinks about disability in the way they do. Edit 3: I was not expecting the scale of this response! I have spoken with my fiance and we have both agreed to get a lot of space from these people. Thank you all so much!","If both you and your fiance are happy with each other, the rest of your friends can go fuck off. You guys are already engaged, and no one gets engaged on a whim. Your fiance's got engaged to you because he values you.  Don't let someone else make you miserable. Don't let them dictate upon you or your fiance's happiness. Again congrats on your engagement.

bp332x,"Hi everyone, my last post wasnt super popular or anything but I just thought I'd update you guys anyways! About a month ago, I went back to school a week after my dad died, and obviously the last few weeks have been super hard.

bqftfh,"Since we met my boyfriend has been on and off of tinder, I’ve been very clear that it hurts me but he always defended it as just him ‘wanting an ego boost’. A few months ago we had a major argument about it where I threatened to leave and I honestly thought that was going to be the end of it. Pretty naive, really. Also I should note his ex before me left him for this very reason- I feel like an idiot for thinking he’d ever change. Today I woke up and realised he’d been using my phone and his email was logged in. I noticed he’d gotten an email from an app called hinge- just to give you an idea of the kind of app this is, the description read: ‘the app that was designed to be deleted’. Great. My stomach instantly dropped. I logged into it with his phone number and he’s put up profile pictures of him that I’ve taken when we’ve been on days out together?! In his description he’s got things like ‘we’ll get along if you like Chinese and have a dog, if you’re silly and comfortable and over share’. He’s also put in as a strict preference that he wants to be matched with hindus/muslims only. I’m white british. I knew something was going on yesterday but wasn’t sure what, he was acting differently and it was making me so anxious. He had the nerve to tell me that I must just be hormonal? I think the worst part about it is his reaction to all of this- he heard me crying, acted concerned and then saw me with his phone, at which point he just took it from me and went back to bed. That was about an hour ago and the only interaction I’ve had with him since was him asking me to open the bathroom door... not to see if I was okay, but because he needed to pee. This post sounds like a joke at this point. I’m obviously hurt by the fact that he’s on this thing but I think I’m more shocked by his total lack of guilt or response to me being upset. I’m so angry and there’s nothing I can do with it- I’m so embarrassed about the situation I don’t want to tell my family/friends how he’s treated me, and I can’t even talk to him about it because he’s refusing to address anything’s wrong, he’s still in bed. I don’t know what to do. He’s brought my self esteem down so much that I feel like I can’t be without him, but I know i can’t stay in this situation. Should I even bother trying to talk to him or should I just leave? I’ve taken screenshots of everything and initially I was going to send them to his family but thought against it. The thing is, if I just leave there’s literally zero consequences for him. He gets what he wants, he gets the freedom to go on random dates with no guilt. It just seems so fucking unfair that I’m the one left heartbroken and he gets to party up. I know the majority of replies are going to tell me to leave, and I can’t argue with you there. But how do I quell this need for closure/revenge? TLDR: caught my boyfriend of three years on another dating app, he’s refusing to even acknowledge the fact that I’m upset. Don’t know what to do. &#x200B; Edit-**UPDATE:** So within the hour after I'd initially written this post I got myself and my stuff together, packed it in my car and left. It felt impossible, there was a lot of stuff and I was a wreck but I managed it in the end. Throughout the whole time, he was just in bed pretending to sleep, which made me angry more than anything. I felt like he couldn't care less. We'd been living together for two years but fortunately, in September I'd decided to get my own student apartment- obviously, I knew then that things weren't going well and thank god I made that decision because now I have a place to stay. Whilst I was sat on the driveway in my car ready to leave I got a text from him saying 'I'm not going to insult you by asking you to stay or to come back but could you please leave the keys to the house'. I had already left them, but that last dig at me made me so mad and hurt. No apology, no goodbye just 'leave the keys'. I guess that's my closure.  &#x200B; So currently I'm just sitting in bed with my stuff all around me in bags reading through these comments, and have been for the last couple of hours. Thank you for the support, even the comments that were harsh I greatly appreciate- it just gave me a wake-up call and a kick up the ass to sort my life out. I'm sad that this shitshow of a relationship has come to an end, angry that it happened the way it did- but funnily enough, I'm relieved. I can do what I want now and get on top of my self-esteem issues. I'm driving down to see my mum and the rest of the family tomorrow, I haven't seen them since Christmas and I absolutely cannot wait. The anger's still there, but I'm just going to get on with things. I absolutely cannot waste any more energy on that guy.  &#x200B; Any advice for my newly single life/getting him out of my head?","You’re leaving, right? Like, you’re planning out the move and sounding out your friends, right? Imagine still being in this place in two months, 6 months, a year... Please leave, OP. <3",4738
br84x0,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bh5tlh/my_28f_partner_28m_is_convinced_i_am_cheating/ So it got a bit of attention so I wanted to do an update. Plus shit hit the fan over the last few days, so buckle yourselves in. After we spoke about the original issue, things did get better. Then, little fragments of other controlling behaviour started to come out. I thought we could work through them. Until when things came to a head. I found out he had, in fact, cheated on me. When I attempted to leave him over this, he became very, very abusive to the point where he was arrested. Three things, screamed, threatened me, trapped me in the house. I’m crushed, but relieved I found out now. Staying with friends currently. Trying to process. So, I guess, if there’s a moral to the story - don’t ignore signs of abuse? But, I can’t help the sense that the escalation came out of nowhere, and how - before - if you’d tried to tell me this would have happened I would have laughed in your face. I guess I don’t know what I could have done to prevent this.  The original issue seemed to be able to be worked through, but was masking... this. Thank you to everyone who offered advice and support in my previous post. Apart from that one guy who thought I’d had a Freudian slip in one of my comments and became convinced I had, actually, cheated on my partner. Like I was a Scooby Doo villain. In retrospect, you can go fuck yourself. Tl;dr boyfriend thought I was cheating, he was cheating, became abusive, got arrested, I eacaped",I'm so sorry that happened to you. Thank you for the update and reinforcing the idea that cheaters project their behavior onto innocent people,1498
brxhuk,"i though i would provide an update to my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/azopg2/i_16m_got_into_an_argument_with_my_older_brother/).  someone advised me that i write my brother a letter apologizing, which i did. i apologized for being mean and hurtful, and that I was wrong for doing that. i also got him a separate card and wrote a message thanking him for everything he's done for me. I went to his house with my letter and card when I found out he was home to go talk to him, but unfortunately when I got there he was gone already, so I slid them under the door.  When he got back home he found them and read them, and then he called me to arrange to come see me. He came over here and I apologized in person for what I said. He was very straightforward with me and honest about my actions. He explained that the reason he had been avoiding me lately is because he needed some time apart because he was beginning not to like me. He said loved me, but I he didn't want to be around me sometimes. That was pretty hard to hear. He said that lately I've just been not very nice, the comment about our Dad was by far the worst, but I make other snappy comments. He had tried to brush it off as me being 'just as teenager', but had now decided it was best to let me know. ""Being a teenager is not an excuse to be a constant asshole to everybody at home"", is how he put it. He gave a few examples and looking back he was absolutely right.  It was pretty upsetting to hear. I know he wasn't saying it to upset me, and I was thankful that he was telling me (or at least I'm thankful now). I promised that I would check my attitude, he said a little more thoughtfulness was all I needed, and that even though sometimes I act like an asshole he knows I'm not one. After we finished talking we hugged, he told me not to forget that he loves me and that I'm great.  Since then I've been trying to be more considerate. I really am trying to follow the advice he gave me. It's been a couple months now, and I'm happy to say that it's working. Our mom told me a couple weeks ago that Im a joy to be around. In the car earlier today my brother told me that its been really nice spending time with me lately. so thats good news.  TL;DR apologized to my brother for the terrible thing I said to him. he warned me that I was turning into someone that he didn't want to be around, even though he loved me. i've worked on fixing my attitude over the past two months, and today my brother told me its nice to hang out with me these days.  Edit: wow, wasn’t expecting this to get big. Thanks for the advice, and for the gold. Much appreciated.","This is such a great update.     I was told the same thing as a 16 year old and I just decided to play the game for the people I needed to like me.  It took much longer for me to realise that genuinely being a nice person was actually an end goal in and of itself because when I was approaching the world from a nicer frame of mind, it responded. You've learned something many people take much longer to learn and bloody good for you. Keep it up :)",1015
bsmrxg,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/brh5h8/my_26f_father_55m_contacted_me_out_of_the_blue/ Hi all, Thought I would update you on what happened since my last post. And I want to thank everyone again for all the advice, it really helped me make a decision. So, I decided to email him back, to try and find out why he was coming back now, after all these years, out of nowhere. And oh boy, am I glad for not having jumped all in... Instead of telling you guys what happened, I think simply translating the emails (with all names redacted of course) will make it much easier to follow. So here we go. Here's the email I sent him, in response to his first messages to try and reconnect. Not a very nice email, I know, but I wanted to see if he had really changed and if he was actually ready to apologize or at least recognize what he'd done wrong. - - - -  Hi, Email not easy to read (nor write). Just trying to be honest here. I don’t have an answer to give you yet, I’m thinking about it, I can’t get past 13 years and tell myself “let’s forget everything and start from scratch” in 2 days. I need to think, given the situation. But I do have a question for you – why now ? Your answer won’t influence my decision, I just need to understand. My first reaction when reading your emails was ""is he dying ?"". Try to understand, 13 years with no contact and I receive this on a Monday morning, out of the blue, it brings up a lot of questions in my head. And it’s not like nothing’s happened in these 13 years. Maybe it would be easier if that were the case (or maybe not, I don’t know). The last I heard anything about you, via other people, was 2 years ago when gran was ill. 2 years. That’s not long ago, and I’m still recovering from that period. The last 2 years may have been the most difficult years of my life. 2 years of depression, thinking about gran every single day, being mad at you for not contacting me, hating you for not even telling me when the funerals were gonna take place, and because of all this, I won’t ever be able to get closure. And yes I also have some blame in there, don’t think I haven’t been mad at myself during the last 2 years as well. I will be mad at myself, and at you, probably my whole life, this story is not something I will ever be able to just forget. Trying to reconnect at that time, 2 years ago, might have seemed more logical to me. When a family goes through this kind of thing, with a family member very sick, they have to get closer to each other, around that family member. At least, that’s what I thought. But instead, I had people telling me you got angry at them for just letting me know gran was sick. Like I didn’t have the right to know about it ? At that time, it seemed very clear to me that I wasn’t part of your family at all, and that you wanted me to stay as far away as possible. I felt your hatred, which I never managed to understand. Whatever happened between you and me, I’d always hoped, until then, that if whatever happened for gran, I would receive a quick email, or a message on FB, anything, just to let me know what was going on. But no. So I’ve had to try and grieve gran without being able to say goodbye, and I’ve had to accept the fact that my dad wanted nothing to do with me. It’s far from easy, hence 2 years of depression. All the arguments around money, the stories between you and mom, or even the stories between us and [new wife], all of that is very old for me. So old that today, I can’t remember everything that has happened. So it could be easy to forget about these, if there was all there is to it. But what happened with gran is something I am still feeling today and is much harder to get past. So yes, my question is, why now and not 2 years ago ? I will wait for your answer. I know reading this email can’t be easy, as I said before, it was far from easy to write as well. But if you truly want to reconnect, on my end I need to understand before I make any kind of decision.  - - - He then replied, and his email made me the angriest I had ever been before. Since my following reply includes his whole email (I replied inline), I'll just paste my reply and you'll have his email at the same time. Here goes. - - - HIM: Ok, let’s be honest and speak freely : let’s talk about gran, poor her, my she rest in peace. I think your relationship with her was more than occasional and that at one point, she got tired only of only being contacted for your birthday, ME: >> So already here, no. Just, no. My relationship with gran was very good at the time. I was at Uni and I would go spend the weekend at her place very often. We would play Yams, I would make pizzas, etc. I have lots of good memories of that period. So, no. HIM: that’s why the last years of her life she had cut contact with you (yeaah, still a money argument !). ME: >> And no again. I remember perfectly the last conversation I’d had with her. I was calling her to tell her I just passed my License Degree. And she was mad after you told her that we had apparently “stolen your money”. And she just hung up. So no, I am not to blame here. You’ve taken enough from me, I won’t let you tarnish my memories of her. And what you probably don’t know, is that she asked for my forgiveness, when I went to see her 2 years ago. She knew perfectly what happened, and knew I wasn’t to blame in the story. So, just, no. When I went to see her at Uni, I would always try to avoid talking about my relationship with her, to try not to make her sadder that she already was. While on your side, you decided to bury me and break my relationship with her. So if someone is to blame here, that’s you, certainly not me. MY fault, was to accept it without saying anything, and not trying to reconnect after a while. And yes, I blame myself for that. But for everything else, you’re gonna have to wake up at some point and accept the consequenses of your actions. HIM: By the way, quickly on the side, not having any contact with me, ok, but why did you cut ties with [new kids], they didn’t have anything to do with the situation, [new wife] has always felt really affected about this. ME: >> I wasn't against them. But you lived together. If they’d tried to contact me, I wouldn’t have said no, far from it. But here again, you’re putting all the blame on me, that’s quite easy. HIM: Getting back to gran, indeed, I didn’t warn you when she got sick, nor when she died, because, and I’ll be perfect honest here, I imagined you coming out of nowhere, without warning anyone, without having taken any news from her for years, and I imagined you coming to do the inventory. ME: >> Funny, that’s EXACTLY what I told [gran’s best friend] at the time. It’s crazy how you’re turning the situation around to your advantage. Let’s be clear, right now. I DON’T GIVE A CRAP about your money. And when I heard about gran, no, I wasn’t the devil you created in your head, I just wanted to see her, for me, and for her. NO SHITS GIVEN about the f***ing inventory. If that was what I cared about, no need to go see her, I could have just found you or taken a lawyer.  HIM: It’s because you cut ties with gran that I didn’t want you there and that I didn’t try to reconnect back then. We were very shocked at the time, with gran’s best friend, about the way you acted. So no, it was absolutely not a question for me to try and reconnect with you then. ME: >> The way I acted. Nobody thought that maybe, just maybe, I needed a moment to process what was going on? Years with no news, and the whole situation gets thrown at me out of nowhere, with no warning. When I received the FB message, 2 days later I was on a plane to go see her. Afterwards yes, I took too long to call her again when I got back home. And yes, I blame myself for it. But here again, it’s very easy to paint me as a devil, without having even tried to understand what was going on in my head. HIM: To answer your question, « why now », well I’m asking myself the same. It’s been weeks, months that I’m thinking about it and I’m trying to let my heart speak instead of my brain. ME: >> Your heart ? Seriously ? I don’t see anything in this email that shows me you even have one. HIM: And at the same time, if I didn’t do this, would you have done it ? I’ve gone through my past, persuaded myself that I needed to stop banging on about my resentment towards you which also had consequences on your sister who didn’t do anything. ME: >> Here congratulations, this is the best I’ve heard all year. So you’re basically trying the blame the fact that YOU cut ties with her, on me. I must be dreaming. Nobody ever prevented you from taking her on weekends or during holidays, when I decided to stop coming. By the way, legally, you HAD to continue seeing her. But no, you’re right, that must be on me again ! HIM: It’s not only during « grand happenings » that you’re supposed to get news from your family or try to reconnect. By the way, I am to blame regarding your sister, for not continuing to reply to her messages since 2008.  ME: >> Oh, wow, you’re actually accepting part of the blame. It’s gonna snow. So, to recap your email : · You have absolutely not changed one bit. You stay the manipulator you were 10 years ago. · You are a First Class mythomaniac. You’ve invented a diabolical version of me, your daughter, and truly believe your own lies. · Obviously, you’re pushing all the blame onto me (why not, after all, I am a devil who wants to take all of your money). · And, of course, you’re not apologising for anything. So my answer is an absolute no. I officially do not want anything to do with you anymore. If at your age, you still don’t realise that the life you invented for yourself is a huge mass of lies, sad for you, but on my end I will continue living, knowing you once and for all out of my life. I managed the last 10 years, I will live even better now that this whole thing is finally over. So, maybe, thank you! Thanks for proving to me that I was right about you, and that I shouldn’t spend even 1 more second thinking about you. My goal with yesterday’s email was to see if you had changed, I have my answer. Don’t even try to reply to this email. I am blocking you, and if that doesn’t work, I will simply delete every single of your messages when they come in, without reading them. I won’t give you the chance to explain yourself, you just did, everything is clear as day on my end now. I’m going to bring back a sentence you sent me years ago, when I had tried to reconnect. You said “if for you, I don’t have a wife, then I don’t have daughters anymore.”. Well today, I am telling you : if you don’t have a daughter, then I don’t have a father anymore. Do not EVER try to contact me again. I hope that is clear. Not tomorrow, not a year from now, not even on your deathbed. For me, you died today. - - - And there we go! Yes, I know, I've been downright nasty. But honestly, I think I needed to get it all out. After reading his email, I felt like I was going to burst out in flames, he reaaaaally pissed me off. And I feel so much better now. It's like, maybe I needed to push all my anger out, to feel 'free' in a way. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel so much lighter now, I haven't felt like this for years. Feel free to comment of course and let me know your thoughts on the email exchange. And again, thank you all so much for the support. I wouldn't have managed to do this without you guys. TL;DR: I replied to his email, telling him how I felt about the whole thing and especially about my gran. I wanted to see if he'd changed. He very much did not.","You responded far more than I would have. He kept trying to push buttons in each response. When you responded and disproved what he said, he'd change topic and throw something different at you.  Doesn't seem like there is anything worth talking to him about from what I see in those messages. You're right to block him and move on.",1260
bt4rrs,"If you saw this yesterday I apologize it was taken down because I somehow fat fingered something to look like a link thu breaking a rule, and while I had great responses I was unable to reply etc. **TL;DR:** 2 special needs kids. SAHM to basically be able to do all the therapies and appointments. Am huge now. Husband never has sex with me but swears he loves me and is attracted to me. Works late and very little interaction. Feel like he's with me not to be the asshole who leaves his wife with 2 special needs kids. Didn't celebrate my birthday and mother's day was not much better.  He may be on the spectrum a well. **\*\*How can i fix this mess esp the dead bedroom/lack of love?\*\*** We've been married 11 years. High school sweethearts...well started dating right after high school. Not each other's first boyfriend/girlfriend but I've only had sex with him. Jack and I have been married for 11 years. We have two kids. Both of our kids had special needs with our oldest being extremely high functioning and gifted and our younger child being in the moderate category for autism. Our youngest is 4. Jack is a very successful person and while I had a promising career when our oldest child had issues we decided since I made less and had better medical background I would stay home. He was happy to do this as his own mom stayed home but it was hard for me as I always saw myself working and being successful. I'm being vague because he does read this sub. I took our oldest to all therapies and was an aide in preschool for him. Honestly without driving it was over a part time job and some years over a full time job. My life became all about pushing this child uphill and itworked Now you would never know he had severe challenges. He still gets social therapy and needs anxiety help but really he just seems like a super smart child, We were both still very much in love and decided to have our second child. This was before we knew our older one had aspbergers. Our oldest was diagnosed when our younger child was mere months old. With a newborn I still did all of the therapy, driving and preschool stuff with my older. Around age 2.5 it became apparent while our younger child was hitting milestones he regressed. He is one of the small percentage of children who regress after the age of two. I admit this fucked with me bad and I was suicidal. I was put on medication and am dealing well with it but I felt like my child was stolen. to go from fully verbal and conversational to mute and right when his brother was graduating all his therapies save social skills therapy was a huge mind fuck. I was gutted. I began putting on more weight and my eating for comfort got out of control. I'm now trying I sti to accept where our youngest is and take happiness in what strides he is making. l take on childcare and therapies. I'm never home long enough to clean and organize it and when I am I'm usually so beat and tired to organize the toys they dump etc. Forget spring cleaning it never happens. My husband was always messy so it just adds to it being a shithole of clutter(not filth the trash is taken out and dishes done but messy clutter and unwashed walls with kid prints on it). I feel I never get a break. He is worse off than his brother in many ways but he is also the happiest kid. When we got married I was 130lbs and 5'8. Looking back I think I was extremely attractive but had poor self esteem as I was not American ideals and was bullied a lot for my ""ethnic looks"". After our first was born I struggled to lose weight but I did. After our second I was losing weight until my oldest was diagnosed with aspbergers. I then comfort ate. Currently I am 260lbs. The heaviest I have ever been. I'm on depression medication. Our house is a mess, I'm always stressed out and just exhausted. Jack has always been overweight but it never bothered me. I'm talking around 220 most of his adult life and he is 5'9. He is now 245. He does have some health stuff but it's minor and not severe. His professional life is super bright but due to our children's needs you wouldn't tell how well he is doing for himself. My birthday he ""forgot"" because I was depressed and did not want to go out due to my younger child being kicked out of a preschool so we didn't even cut a store bought cake. His birthday came around and he got himself something expensive and nice and I also got him a nice gift and card. I planned a surprise party for him. I'm trying to have the kids make him a father's day gift. I make sure every day to tell him how much I adore him and love him. I feel unloved. We never have sex anymore. The kids reject him because he barely interacts-if I am honest he may have aspbergers himself- so I am putting them to bed. I ask him and he says he's tired or work or whatever else excuse. Today he turned down a bj. Not even a bodily response when I was trying to initiate it. He says it's just the kids, stress, work, exhaustion, his back hurts literally everything. He swears he loves me and is attracted to me still but the lack of sex unless I literally beg him bothers me. He jacks off so I know it's not a testosterone thing. I've offered counseling and he says he loves me and doesn't know where it is coming from. I'm starting to feel like we're married because I am a SAHM and can bring our special needs kid to 100000 appointments and he worries if we divorce who would do it not to mention he probably would feel bad if he left me because our kids. I love him so much but either he is in denial or I am crazy. I want to stay married to him. I don't think I could ever love someone the way I love him but I don't think he loves me anymore- and again he swears he does. I just don't get how we would have sex every day then every other day after our first was born then three times a week after our second was born to now I'm lucky if I get it twice a month and I have to harass him for it. He doesn't initiate it. It kills me because I just feel ugly. I also suspect he is upset the house went to hell but I feel like I can't keep up both my kids are in therapies granted my oldest who is gifted is just in a private social group but still I never have a break. He works until 8pm most weekdays and I feel it may be a choice. When he gets home he's on his computer or takes hours on the bathroom where he hides from us. When he is home he seems irritated with everything. We do date nights a few times a month but it's either silent or me filling conversation. I'm so lost and I don't know where to start. When I ask him what I need to do or how I can fix this he reassures me he loves me and is just tired and nothing is broken. I was raised by a single mom so I really don't know what to do here and if I am being crazy. I'm too ashamed to ask my female friends because they joke their husbands bug them for sex too much and they are tired. Is it normal to have a super dead bedroom for over a year in long relationships? I just want to fix this. I love him.","I’m so sorry. Reading all of that, of course you feel down. You said he makes a good living, yes? Could y’all afford for a maid to come in, just once a week, to tidy up the house? Better yet, maybe hire a professional caretaker to handle the kids for 1-2 days per week. Taking them to appointments, taking care of their needs, etc. If you could free up just a bit of time for yourself, where you can handle other household tasks, prep healthy meals that can be stored in the freezer for the rest of the week, or even just go do something you used to love for a while, I think the entire energy of the home could be changed. You just need help. One idea could be that you hire a maid, yes, and then also hire a professional caretaker to take care of your kids 3 nights a week for an hour or so. With that time, go work out—it sounds like this weight issue is causing more problems than just physical discomfort for you, it sounds like it’s really hitting your self-esteem hard, as well. TL;DR: You need to call in reinforcements of SOME kind. I agree that your husband should be coming in earlier and helping around the house more, but sometimes our spouses need to see us make a big, difficult change ourselves, and then they can begin to see the light, and follow along. Not that you haven’t already been shouldering the burden of so many responsibilities in this relationship already! But sitting down with him and saying, “I’m unhappy, and I’ve identified some of the key reasons why, and here’s my game plan for how to fix it: I’m getting a maid to come clean once a week, and I’m hiring a professional sitter to watch the kids while I go work out three nights a week. I think we’re both unhappy coming home to a filthy house, and I know my self-esteem has tanked since gaining this weight, and I genuinely think that coming home to a bright, clean house and feeling like I still have *some* time to focus on just me, will dramatically improve the energy around here, and even in our relationship.” Go ahead and find out the pricing of maids and professional sitters in your area, reconcile it with your budget, and lay it out for him so he can see the benefit. Also, there’s a great chance your husband does in fact love you tremendously still, but he’s feeling so bogged down and sad about where he is in life right now, sex just sounds difficult. Men are emotional creatures, too, and sex is an emotional act. Masturbation is a basic release, but sex requires intimacy and vulnerability. If he’s feeling overweight, in pain, worried that he’s disappointing you, and overwhelmed about his house, his children, and his job, (have you asked him why he stays so late? Maybe he genuinely has a lot on his plate?) sex isn’t going to sound great, despite what we’re told about men basically being animals when it comes to always wanting sex. Start to contain The Overwhelm, beginning first with things that you can do on your own, (since he’s rejecting the idea of couple’s therapy ATM) and see if the mood and general calm in your house begins to improve. Obviously, again, this isn’t your fault or your sole responsibility, (I hope I don’t sound like I’m saying this is on you?) but since you’re on your own for right now, take charge where you can, and see what things can change, so you can gradually take steps toward a healthier, happier home environment for you and your family. **Edit:** OP, check below this comment for a LOT of great recommendations for resources! Lots of Redditors suggested some great ways to get help that sound perfect for you!",3869
bto2oo,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b47frm/friend_37f_is_about_to_be_turneddown_for_a/) &#x200B; &#x200B; Lordy. Where do I begin. I need more help.  &#x200B; The guy they wanted took the job - way more than they initially wanted to spend. My friend was devastated. I followed the advice here and told her she did a great job and how proud I was of her, but the other guy did an amazing job and I didn't know what would happen. She was confident that she was going to win - she had more experience with the company vs. his experience & education. At 4:55 she got a call thanking her but that they went in a different direction. HR offered to meet to discuss how she could improve and to stabilize working relations with the new guy. Shortly there after it was announced company-wide he had agreed to take the job and they were thrilled. She took the following couple of days off and didn't respond to text or email. She just completely took some time away (fair enough). She returned mid-next week and found-out that he wasn't going to start until a couple of weeks later and that she had time. Then a company-wide email went out announcing that not only had he finished the final requirements for his MBA and took first place in his final case competition beating every other school in the country but that he was starting sooner than anticipated. A lot of emphasis was placed on his Ivy League education, which really irked Tina.  &#x200B; He would come in occasionally (before his start date) to meet with senior executives and his team members and pushed them to get unvarnished thoughts - a lot of them really complained about working conditions on the team and major obstacles they faced. A few really told him the unvarnished truth.  &#x200B; His start date rolled around there after, and the hype was real. He hit the ground running and his first week was incredibly busy. On day one he held an open meeting where he came in and immediately banned weekend emails (some teams were expected to check/respond to emails 7 days a week), gave staff commensurate working hours to the rest of the company (we never got summer hours or flex time, which he immediately changed) and followed-up on promises made by previous staff. He rolled out new processes, budget models and is a far more effective at advocate for the team - so much so that all the old time staff have become his ""followers"". A lot of people were worried about being fired (performance had been way down) but we're already seeing a glimmer of hope - the cuts he made preserved his staff, meaning they have a little less cash to spend but a lot more bodies doing the work. All told, they're better off now ( three weeks in) than we were this time last year. The staff love him, he's very approachable, informal and because of his connections to senior leaders in other departments, that team gets a lot more attention than we used to. Our old boss was sweet and kind, but she was incredibly ineffective. I'm considering transferring back into that unit because the working environment is better than where we are.  &#x200B; The problem has become Tina. She's tried to question his leadership, she's openly annoyed with colleagues and feels like she's the only person who doesn't ""see"" the truth. The value in the new guy is his ability to change - our teams work in close collaboration and their team is a lot more productive now than before and are getting better quality work done - they've started conversations with old clients and the business funnel has grown. VPs openly comment that he'll be moved up in short order. Yet, Tina holds are horrible grudge. It's obvious with how she interacts with staff and colleagues; she complains when he's not in the office and complains when he is in the office. I know of a least a few people who are growing weary of this and two have asked me to say something to Tina (since we're friends). Another threatened to go to HR.  &#x200B; For all his connections and Ivy League education, the guy is also a really strong performer. He has an activity board up showing process and change and people feel less dour, except Tina. She's complaining non-stop. It's impacted our relationship to the point where I've been avoiding her. It's been two months since she found out and three weeks since he started, and I feel like ""enough is enough"" that said, she's a single mom and I don't want to see her fired for being silly.  &#x200B; I'm really not good with confronting people, I don't know what I should say.  &#x200B; tl;dr the new guy started and the hype was real. he's been great but Tina took rejection so badly that I'm worried she's going to be fired. I'm not sure how to handle this. She's going to get fired if she doesn't stop complaining and people want me to speak with her.","Tina’s only hurting herself in the long run. When this guy moves up in the organization, Tina’s the next logical candidate for his current role - as long as she quits acting so unprofessionally. I’m not saying she has to become the guy’s biggest fan; just quit moaning and whining. The way Tina behaves now is what upper management will think of when they’re looking at her for other roles. If she can show that she can be professional with someone she doesn’t like, she’s laying the groundwork to show she can be a good team leader in the future.",3233
bvsdrb,"My husband and I have been together  15 years and married for 11. He’s a physician in the US which, as most everyone knows, comes with a hefty price tag. We got married right out of undergrad and the summer before he started medical school. I had to change which masters program i was going to last minute but i was able to get in and get a job and was able to support the both of us with this job (that I loved) while he finished med school. When he graduated, he got a residency in another state (and barely even consulted me about it before he applied and interviewed and decided. I put it behind me and packed up and moved with him and was luckily able to find another job that was better salary wise but I hated and was able to fully support us both while he was able to put all of the money he made in residency towards his student loans. After he finished, I was able to get a different job thats better than I ever could’ve dreamed of and got a major promotion near the end of 2018. Since January 2019 my husband has been pushing for us to start trying for a baby. He also doesnt want strangers “raising” his children so he doesn’t want to put them in daycare or have a nanny when we have them. We also don’t have any family close by nor do we have any friends that would be able to take on that responsibility. He also doesn’t want to quit his job or go down to part time in his job to take care of said kids, but he expects me to be a stay at home mom. I’m not ready for a baby right now.  I’m not ready to sideline my career and leave my dream job that I have worked my ass off for.  I told him as much which resulted in a fight where he told me that I should leave my job because his is more important than mine since he “saves lives everyday” and I don’t and ultimately most people could do my job with a “little bit of common sense” whereas his is way more than just sitting at a desk all day (which I don’t even do). When the subject of kids came up years ago, he said no because he wasn’t ready and wanted to finish his education. Despite what I wanted, I accepted it and moved on because I understood where he was coming from and respected his feelings.  When I brought this up he said I was throwing it in his face and making him feel guilty for wanting to pursue his dreams.  I had to walk away because I was so furious and hurt by what he said. And since that fight, I’ve been thinking about it over and over and have found  myself thinking things i probably shouldn’t and wanting to bring up how my unimportant career supported his ass while he accomplished his dreams but he didn’t complain about how unimportant it was then. I supported him mentally, emotionally, and physically too and if he was up at home studying I was up helping him study, I made sure his clothes were clean and that he ate and slept and was comfortable when he came home after he had a long day despite me also having a long day. I dealt with my father passing away on my own because he was unavailable due to his training. I gave up my dream program, my original dream job, the place I loved and wanted to live forever and my desire to have kids so that he could accomplish his goals. I was depressed and miserable for years at a job I didn’t like, in a city that I hated because it meant he was able get what he wanted in life. I know you’re not supposed to do things with the intention of being paid back or “keeping score” but I did all of those things because I love my husband and expected that, at the VERY LEAST, he would respect me and my career and be understanding and supportive of my wants and needs like I have been with him since the moment we got married. It just seems like I’m the only one sacrificing and being selfless in our marriage. And not only that but my job is important. I may not be an MD or “saving lives” in the moment but I am making a significant difference and change in the lives of my patients and helping improve their quality of life and leading them to be healthier overall and work alongside several physicians who have recognized the positive impact I’ve had on the lives of many people yet the one who matters most to me doesn’t recognize or believe this and it hurts like hell honestly.  I’m mad and hurt right now but I know that if the resentment fully sets in it’ll be the worst case scenario. How do I stop this from happening and how do I stop feeling this way towards my husband?  Tl;Dr: Husband is being a jerk about my career and I feel myself starting to resent him and don’t want these feelings to get any worse towards him. How can I stop having these thoughts about him and our marriage?","I’m not sure that you *should* stop having these thoughts about him or your marriage, because you’re absolutely justified in feeling this way. He’s marginalized your career - the same career that was good enough to support him through med school - and expects you to give it up to raise your children... you know, the ones he’s too busy and important to raise himself.  Have you considered marriage counseling? Does he know how you feel, and why you feel you’ve accommodated his dreams all this time only for yours to be brushed off like this? Does he understand that he’s basically saying that what he wants is more important than what you want is?",4168

About a month after I posted, I asked him for a separation. He agreed. I moved out and I've got my own place now. I thought maybe moving out would be the wake up call that was needed to save the marriage, but it wasn't. However, it turned out to be the best thing for all of us.  We share custody of our children, and they transitioned to public school and are doing very, very well.  I'm doing pretty well, too. It's been hard - and there have been a lot of ups and downs, but it's been worth it. We're all so much happier now, and my ex and I are working really well together to co-parent our kids and we're even friends. We'll always be there for each other, but we're better off apart.  Not the happy ending that I was hoping for, but a happy ending nonetheless. TL;DR: We split up, things are good now.",Speaking as a child of divorce: Happy single parents are better parents together than miserable married ones.

c1rg8l,"[I posted a few weeks back about breaking up with my boyfriend many months ago for drug use](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bv8ike/i_27f_dumped_my_boyfriend_27m_for_using_cocaine/), but wanting to hopefully start seeing him again as he started seeking a more sober and healthy lifestyle. One struggle was his friends pretty actively painting me as controlling, and someone who doesn't love him for who he is. I was also very worried about the ease of getting away from that lifestyle. &#x200B; I've been amazed at the continued push-back from his friends. They had a ""guys weekend"" last weekend where they'd purchased quite a lot of cocaine, plus other misc drugs (adderall, vyvanse, LSD...) He originally had been tasked with the buy for the weekend, but ultimately opted not to go. I was going camping with my friends and told him he was welcome to come along. I told him I trusted him to go, but he chose not to go with his friends. Of course, this led to his friends calling me being controlling, and that I am changing him to meet my own interests. One of his close friends in particular has been a huge instigator in creating as much conflict as possible around this... namely attacking me on twitter, and having him removed from their friend group chats for picking a girl over friends. &#x200B; It's really hard for me to understand all of it and why a select few of his friends have so much opposition to this. I guess I don't see drugs as a personality trait so much as a lifestyle choice, but in their minds, i'm alone in that. I fear this sounding judgmental, but the friends with the firmest oppositions are two dudes who are 29, deliver pizzas, and spend 99% of their time high, at raves and other events like that.  &#x200B; We've been back seeing eachother for 6 weeks now; he's been essentially sober with the exception of a beer here or there. He's been joining me at yoga, we've been doing stuff outdoors like rollerblading, riding bikes, cooking out together, etc and he said he feels a lot more level. I can tell he's bummed feeling ostracized from his friends, but i've repeatedly told him I trust him and will support whatever decisions he makes, even if it means us not being together - just that I expect honesty. &#x200B; It's taken me a few weeks to let go of caring what his friends think about me, but I know my intentions are good. Still sucks feeling hated, but I'm not really sure what else I can do. &#x200B; I really appreciated the advice and sort of reality-slap that those people are largely toxic. There was a lot of really good wisdom that helped me come to the realization that it's not worth my energy to care what they have to say.  &#x200B; Tl;Dr - updating: I'm not regretting seeing my bf who i dumped for cocaine use after he decided to stop using. His friends hate me, but I don't really care.","It sounds to me like his friends are the ones feeling judged. That kind of hard-partying drug lifestyle really isn't cute when you're in your late 20s and not a rockstar, and they probably realize that. It's easier to paint you as controlling and judgmental than it is to admit your boyfriend is taking the grown-up path and they're not. Is he standing up for you? If he's still associating with these people at all he needs to make it very clear that these are his choices and talking poorly about you is unacceptable.",2883
c2sc74,"In the original post, [I described](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bmb8j3/im_27f_scared_my_friend_50m_is_becoming_isolated/) the predicament of my dear friend, a >30-year HIV survivor who suffered massive inexplicable treatment failure and was alone all day in the hospital because his husband was at work and he'd kept his condition a secret. I also described my quixotic effort to become his one-woman T cell cheerleading squad. I'm sorry to report that my friend has died. After all that could be done was done, he went home and passed away surrounded by his loved ones. His suffering is over. That's supposed to be the important thing. In the original post, I avoided talking about the suffering. How his intestines had filled with abscesses and bacterial films and Kaposi sarcoma and God knows what else to the point where he vomited fecal matter. How he weighed \~80 pounds and had a bedsore that showed bone.  How the virus had invaded his brain in a way that might have condemned him to Alzheimer's-like deterioration had he lived, even with the newest and best drugs. He'd stolen three decades from HIV and that bastard was out for revenge. Call me a sweet summer millennial child if you like, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen. Nonetheless, I'd be lying if I said I was taking his death well. I'm writing this  from inside the Pillow Fort of Grief I built in my living room. Redditors have no way of knowing, but he was a wonderful, special person. I opened my heart to him for a reason. The world is a worse place without him. I'm grateful for the advice of some of those who commented on the original post. I did ease  up on the presents. When I visited the hospital, I focused on just spending time with him. We watched a lot of HGTV, and I would try to  make him laugh by making fun of the questionable taste and skewed priorities of the couples on House Hunters. I held his hand, brushed  his hair, stuff like that. The last time I saw him, I told him I loved him and kissed him on the forehead. He could speak faintly at that  point. He said, ""you're so good to me."" You probably have no idea what that meant; I've always thought of myself as a robot and a moral failure, and he knew it. He was the gift-giver in the end. On social his husband is maintaining that he died of freak complications  from routine surgery. I wish I could tell him he didn't have to do this, but this very week an authority figure in town went viral for a deranged homophobic rant in which he said, among other terrible things, that AIDS was God's punishment. I feel like I'm trapped in an '80s time warp, but minus all the fun parts with the synth music and crazy fashion.  I don't know what happens now. Clinical depression? Volunteer work? Befriending the husband? There's a big old void right in the middle of my life. It's the price you pay for caring, sometimes. TL;DR rest in peace my beautiful friend &#x200B; \*\*\*EDIT\*\*\* Wow, this post exploded. I am overwhelmed by all the condolences and well wishes and unusable throwaway karma coming my way. You're all the kind heart of Reddit. And you like my writing? That's too much. Stop it.  People are asking why I think I'm a bad person. The answer is that I was diagnosed (probably correctly) with an autism spectrum disorder in my teens and told that my social deficits were caused by failure to develop the capacity for empathy. There is now tons of pushback on this theory of autism, but it was dominant at the time. I was vulnerable and impressionable and I thought, ""Oh no, I'm a sociopath. I'll have to spend the rest of my life hiding how rotten I am inside."" I mope about my moral fiber the way other women mope about their weight. I'm doing it right now, fretting over whether this post is narcissistic.  My friend showed me another side to myself, a bright mirror. He changed my life. Losing him is heartbreaking.","Thank you for being there in his time of need.  People take HIV far too lightly these days. Many that should be on PREP are not and play with fire. Yes, it’s likely you’ll live a long and healthy life with it; but, your friend shows that drugs can and do fail at which point it progresses to AIDS. Seeing someone die like this changes you. Imagine a whole generation of gay men dying because people weren’t sure what was up at first, and when we did we had people who didn’t care. Politicians doing nothing or calling it God’s wrath.  Now, there are countless people of all sexualities infected. It’s treatable. But we need to remember how easily that can all go awry in the right circumstances and your life will wither away.  Again, thank you for being there and to witness his life.",1101

I'm also hoping it might be therapeutic to write this out. I did break up with my boyfriend, albeit not immediately after Reddit resoundingly told me to.  A lot of people were saying to me that by doing this to me (especially at this time), Andrew was expressing a lack of commitment to me and consideration for me.  I think part of me knew that as soon as it happened, but I just wasn't ready to accept it yet. We ended up staying together after the incident I described in my post, partially because he apologized profusely and reassured me, but mostly because I had just lost my mom and I wasn't ready to lose him too.  I don't regret staying with him these past few months; he's provided me a lot of support that I would have been to afraid to ask for from anyone else in my life.  But as time went on, his lack of consideration for my feelings and our clear incompatibility continued to resurface.  We talked about breaking up a couple times, and I finally decided to pull the plug last night.  Unsurprisingly, he was pretty relieved.  He admitted that he has wanted this for awhile, but has ""wronged"" me so many times in our relationship that he felt an obligation to ""do right by me"" and not end things until I was ready.   It's hard to take this kind of loss while I'm still dealing with the loss of my mother, but I know it's for the better.  Thanks for the advice, Reddit.   **TL;DR: We finally broke up.**",">He admitted that he has wanted this for awhile, but has ""wronged"" me so many times in our relationship that he felt an obligation to ""do right by me"" and not end things until I was ready.

c6irbo,"Repost as removed as broke a rule in error - apologies! Throwaway for obvious reasons. First things first this may be long and windy, I hope it all makes sense but I think just typing it out and getting it off my chest will help massively anyway. I need some advice on what I can do here and where I go - i need to keep my friend. &#x200B; I met her two years ago when we worked together and quickly became very close. She helped me through the darkest times of my life (i was mid split with an abusive ex when we met), and I helped her through some really tough and unimaginable things. There were lots of rumours at the time we were seeing each other and everyone assumed we were an item, but for the past two years our relationship has been purely platonic - she is (was?) my best friend and up until a few weeks back I don't think we'd even ever hugged. &#x200B; Fast forward to a week ago - she came over for dinner and wine, this is very common and normal. We had more than usual and she was over the limit so couldn't drive, so she stayed the night. We slept in the same bed but apart and no physical contact again, it was completely normal and just as expected. We somehow didn't get up and ended up staying in bed until 10pm the next day just talking. Sometime during that evening she got upset about something going on in her life, I rubbed her back while telling her everything will be ok and then we just cuddled - probably the first bit of real physical contact between us but nothing was sexual, didn't feel weird and she went home and it was all OK. &#x200B; This last weekend we had a hiking holiday planned, where we'd be sleeping in her van (she has a converted transit). It's one bed but we thought we'd be fine. First night it was freezing, ending up cuddling and spooning but again didn't feel sexual. Second night is where it all went a bit wrong, we drank a bit too much and the spoon ended up getting carried away - it seems to be a joint thing and before I knew it we were kissing and touching each other everywhere. It was a bit of a frenzy of this for about 15 minutes until we both stopped and realised what we just did. After this we spoke a little and asked if either of us regretted it, we both said we didn't but it was odd. She got upset and I told her it was ok - it didn't change anything and we could just draw a line under it. We woke up the next morning and it happened again, we didn't talk too much but then went for a walk and then just before we headed home we ended up all over each other again, we were completely naked but again stopped, cuddled and lay there. We both agreed it was a ""what happens in X, stays in X"" type event. &#x200B; It was a really long trip home (6 hours+), during this she would rest her head on my, hand on lap ect and it seemed very different to our usual dynamic. When we stopped at services for breaks we seemed to walk arm in arm, we kept kissing on and off but it seems strangely normal? We arrived back at her home, she lives with her dad at the moment but just before I left she kissed me again and thanked me for a wonderful weekend. &#x200B; The following day (two days ago) she came over to get some stuff I took home with me, we end up just cuddling, kissing, feeling and so on again. We are on my bed and dry humping but she has dinner with a friend and we stop it there, she goes on her way. Two days later she comes over for a film and food - we had a lovely night, she ends up staying and we end up having sex twice. This should feel really weird and strange, but it felt completely normal and we both discussed it that it was so odd it felt normal. &#x200B; Yesterday she turned up unannounced at my place (which is not a normal thing) with coffee and doughnuts, we end up talking, cuddling, kissing again and then we end up talking about what this is - que the big problem. Neither of us were sure, she got panicky and burst out in tears and left. She said she was really scared and her words were ""I think I will end up pushing you away and hurting you and I don't want to do that to you"". I told her I would come and see her later and talk. I drove to her house but her ex was there, another slight issue. They broke up 6 years ago stayed close friends, he is a lovely bloke but in his head he is certain they will get married and have children. She's had the conversation with him but he seems to shut it off. If he found out she was seeing anyone he would get extremely angry, but there's so much family history intertwined between the both it's really complicated. For that reason she has avoided seeing anyone in the past 6 years. The reason he turned up is she hadn't responded to him since the night we kissed. I went home when I saw his car and just said she could come to mine to chat later. &#x200B; She turned up, sad and very emotional. She explained she ran off because she is terrified of losing our friendship, I said let's just cut the romance out, draw a line under it and be friends again but she seemed to not speak much when I said this. I asked if her ex was the issue - she said it was nothing to do with us but a whole other issue, but that was not impacting what was going on between us. We sat quietly, hugged and I tried to reassure it would be OK, and I wasn't going to start hating her for whatever reason, and I am completely fine with just being platonic friends again. We both agree and say whatever happens we stay friends and nobody gets hurt but we will pull back from the more physical side. This somehow ends up with us kissing? We kiss for a little while and I tell her she should probably go home and get some rest, but everything is ok. We get up and she helps make my bed, I give her a hug and open my bedroom door so she can leave, she then takes the door off me, closes it and kisses me - this then leads to sex and we have really passionate sex for about an hour. We get up, cuddle, kiss and she leaves. &#x200B; I woke up this morning really panicky, I have no idea where we are, where we stand and absolutely terrified of losing our friendship. I don't know what to do or say. I've felt sick to my stomach and can't eat at the thought of this. She is coming around later to collect some of her clothes she left last night and I am thinking I need a plan of what to say/do.I cannot lose my best friend - she is absolutely everything to me but I am worried we crossed a line and there's only one eventual outcome which won't be good. &#x200B; I'm super sorry if this is hard to read, but man it felt like a weight off my shoulders just typing this out. If there's a more appropriate sub for this I can post there instead &#x200B; TLDR; slept with my absolute best friend of 2 years, both now having serious panic issues and overthinking with not knowing what to do. I don't know what I want and I think she is confused too - what on earth can we do to try and protect either of us from getting hurt???",I think you go for it.  It sounds like you’ve set the foundation for a great relationship. Stop calling it “odd” and be truthful that it’s what you want.  Tell her she is “absolutely everything” like you wrote here. Then ask what she wants to do. It’s been six years since that ex. It’s over.,3247
c6uni2,"My mother is disabled due to a neurological illness. She was diagnosed in her late thirties and I remember her mostly as being sick and needing help. I used to really look up to her as super-mom who could overcome any obstacle. That was until my father died. My father passed over a decade ago while I was still in high school. My brother (36M) and I lived with my parents at the time.  I got a job while in high school after he passed, cleaned the house, mowed the grass, bought food with money from my job, paid bills when I could (minimum wage isn’t much), and made dinner most nights for my mom and me. My brother was rarely in the home unless to sleep or because he wanted money.  Over the years, my brother has been in and out of prison dozens and dozens of times for everything from drunk driving to drug possession to stealing from our mother to assault. He is currently incarcerated. No one mentions him or expects anything of him, except my mother who, in violation of a court order for her own protection that she herself asked for, sends him money and speaks to him weekly as well as sends letters.  Back to my father’s death (a seven month bout with illness).  Nearly two years after my father passed. I graduated high school and left for college out of state. I would send my mom money while in college and I distinctly remember, for instance, using my stipend I received in December to buy my mother and brother Christmas gifts because I knew they wouldn’t have anything if I didn’t. No one reciprocated, but I didn’t expect it. Honestly, I didn’t care either until it became a pattern over the next decade. That particular Christmas, barely 18 years old, and I was scraping together pennies to buy a cheap fridge after I came home on winter break with gifts only to realize there was no food in the house.  My brother, in a drug-fueled rage, tore down the Christmas tree I had bought and decorated and threatened to kill himself unless I gave him money because “no one loved him” and it would prove that I “cared.” It is important to note even at this time my mother continued to let my now-felon brother back into home.  I’ll try to skip through the college and graduate studies years but suffice it to say I met my now-husband and I spent less and less time at home. When I was home or when my husband and I visited, it was as follows: clean my mom’s home, buy my mom food, cook for my mom, take care of my mom. I was and remain very clear with my mother that I will not let my brother into my life as he has threatened to kill me (over prescription cough syrup!), thrown me down my stairs, and broken down a door to get at me (and the little bit of cash I had on me at the time). I have no doubt he would try to hurt my child, my husband, or me to get what he wants. He has told me he will find me and he “get me” for his perception that I have wronged him (for not giving him money), and I have ZERO contact with him. I have blocked all numbers that have any correlation to him including friends he has call from outside prison. Note: My mother let him get my number off her phone.  I have told me mother for years that I cannot have my brother in my life until he at least goes one year drug-free. To date, he’s been unable to do so. He has stolen tens of thousands of dollars from her. She always says she won’t let him back in her house, but she in the end forgives him and the cycle repeats. Next year, when he’s released again, she has told me under no uncertain terms that he won’t live with her but she admits she remains in contact, sends him money, and thinks this is “the Devil” in him that makes him a drug-addict. He will move back in.  I have offered to help my mom move closer to me as I live many states away. My husband and I even had a realtor come out and start the process of listing our home so we could find a home with space for my mom. My only condition was that she not bring my brother into my son’s life. She has adamantly refused same. She has also refused to look at assisted living facilities, even though I reached out on my own accord and found great recommendations from her doctors. Now that she had surgery this week, I have had family come out of the woodwork. Honestly, I am resentful of this. I’ve had people who can’t even send me a reciprocal Christmas card tell me that I am “neglecting” my mother by refusing to take time off work and travel to her to take care of her. They do not care that I don’t have the vacation days and would likely lose my job. One even stated that “I wouldn’t care about putting groceries on my table. I wouldn’t work for an employer like that.” Easy words to say; tell that to my hungry toddler. They have said, “Who do you think cared for you as a baby?” and, honestly this one gets to me, “Sometimes you have to learn to deal with life. You can’t just ignore it.”—because “dealing with life” includes losing my job, moving away from my toddler in his formative years, and caring for my mother, I guess?  You can probably tell at this point that I am fed up. I am in a no win position where literally the ONLY surviving family members are telling me to leave my job, my family, my small child, to come care for my mom and help her. They also refuse to put a timeframe on this; it would be “as long as she needed.” I am expected to care for her 24/7, no questions asked. I also strongly feel like they are taking their own resentment at my mother asking them for favors out on me, though I have explained multiple times that I offered for her to stay with us and have the surgery here (at no cost to her, mind you) and she declined. They tell me in response she has a “right to be near her friends.” I have also tried to explain that by bending down to her every beck and call, they are enabling her, but they don’t want to hear it. They do not seem to hear me when I try to explain that, for example, helping her check out of physical therapy facility a week and a half before her doctor’s recommendation, is enabling her and in the long run, not good for her independence. She has grown accustomed to everyone doing everything for her (example, on this past visit, she got very upset with me for not taking her to Wal-Mart because she had to go there at nearly the toddler’s bedtime. This wasn’t an emergency. She wanted to “look around.”).  My mother in all of this mess has taken the position that although she doesn’t “want me to lose my job,” a good daughter should care for her mother. I honestly have a lot of animosity toward this proclamation because my mother has not, since before my father died, called me on my birthday; tried to establish any relationship with my son (I am always the one trying to get them to FaceTime or speak on the phone); and in the last twelve years, I can count on one hand the number of times she has called me just to check in on me or my son or ask how we are doing. If she does reach or and contact, there is always an ulterior motive (money for my brother or for her because she’s given my brother everything).  I am at my breaking point.  I can’t work full-time, care for my family, and also be expected to hear multiple times a week how I am a shitty person for refusing to abandon everything I have worked so hard for to care for my mother. Despite everything, I love my mom. My husband and his family have all seen this unfold and multiple people have remarked “Why do you even try anymore?” (meaning try to schedule calls to allow her to talk to / see my son). I invited her to my home earlier this month, scheduled the plane tickets, assistance though airport, etc., only to watch her play on her phone or spend time playing fetch with her dog rather than read a book to my toddler, who just wanted her attention.  Today, as if a final straw was needed, I called to check in on her and she proclaimed she was going home against doctor’s orders because her dog NEEDS her because the dog is sick. First of all, he has a very minor skin condition that is nearly 100% resolved thanks to her friend  giving him the prescribed ointment. Secondly, my toddler got sick this week (meaning out of daycare for three days sick), and even after I told her of same, she never once called to check on him, just like she never called to check on him when he got the Flu last year, or when he had a mysterious week-and-a-half long illness earlier this year that resulted in four doctor’s appointments and a 104 degree temperature. I can’t stand it anymore. I am literally writing this as a last resort. My husband is saying to go no contact with everyone (this is ALL the family I have left, except one aunt on my father’s side) because he sees me crying when the hurtful comments role in and the guilt trips. He sees me trying to hide it from my child. But then I feel like I am giving them what they want, right? Look at LittleMissPotatoe, such a crappy human being and so inept at “dealing with life,” she just chose to ignore all of us. But I can’t spend my days defending myself to extended family members I have seen in over a decade or, in some cases, over two decades.  Nothing I say is good enough. And nothing I say ever will be.  TL;DR: I have been told in no uncertain terms that I am a horrible person for refusing to abandon my husband and small child and move across county for care for my mother. EDIT: Thank you for your comments and those who offered support. There were a few recurring questions.  (1) I am not covered under the FMLA. My employer is not large enough and my state offers no comparable law. I have one vacation day left due my son getting sick earlier this year (my husband gets nearly triple the days off than me and has taken off many, many more days to care for him). All-in-all, I don’t want to lose my job or find another one. It’s a good job, just one confined by the limits of being a small company. (2) She has refused: moving in with me by either my husband and I building a mother-in-suite or moving to bigger home; any assisted care facilities or nursing homes; moving closer. She has flip-flopped on whether she will allow home care but contradicts herself on this point, telling me “insert name” can help her if she needs anything or she has “friends” she can call or, most common, that she “does fine” and can care for herself. She wants assistance but only *when* she wants it and only on her own terms.  (3) She told me she will not cut ties with my brother. I’ was able to get her to agree to counseling after my brother assaulted her, stole her car, and pawned *all* of her appliances. She moved into a domestic violence shelter, yet she refused to press charges. This occurred when I was going on seven months pregnant and when I refused to travel 20+ hours in a car, I was told essentially the same thing I am being accused of now.  (4) She excuses my brother’s behavior. He has “got in with the Devil” and she “can’t abandon him.” I have spoken with counselors, Adult Protective Services, and it boils down to, she’s an adult, she can make her own decisions. Her doctors, although they seem to agree she could use help taking care of herself, have refused to state she lacks the capacity to care for herself.","This is the point in your life that you learn to live with a few assholes thinking you're a bad person. (BTW, you are not)  Pick your son. Pick your husband. Everyone else is secondary.",4843

But things went about as expected. She cried, I cried, she begged. It wasn't pretty. But for two weeks we've been broken up and she moved out today. The first few days were aweful. But afterwards we were able to talk to each other like normal people. And I helped her with everything I could. I let her take the room while I slept on the couch so she could have space and I tried to make myself as scarce as possible. It's been a sad time and a sigh of relief. She also admitted to me that the reason she never tried to fix anything was because she didn't believe I would ever actually break up with her. She apologized and promised to work on herself. Which I appreciate. I told her there wasn't a chance we could get back together. We just aren't right. And she even said she is willing to try being friends after a while and I told her she is free to talk to me anytime but I won't bother her while she is getting over things. I'm going to have to work things out properly with my financial status. But this is all for the best and I'm glad It happened. I only wish I could have done it earlier. Thanks again for the advice. It helped a ton. TL:DR I went through with the breakup and we are both doing fine now. Thank you for your help.","Been in your shoes before.  &#x200B; We were 25/26, told her we will never get back together, it was very messy and we did live together as well.  &#x200B; 6 months later we got back together and we are now married lol. The time apart gave us time to think and work on our issues alone. Made it a better relationship.",3681
c99q2r,"I’m not trying to be rude at all or anything, I just don’t want to be a burden or anything. My girlfriend [19F] and I [17M] have been dating for a year now, and things are super great. She comes from a very wealhty family, while I come from a really poor family (not as poor anymore). She lives in a 2 million dollar home, her family drives new cars, and she is just wealthy, but she is not a person who feels in entitled because of her family’s wealth. I’m also Latino and her family is American/White (sorry if that’s rude I don’t mean it in a rude manner). I do get along with her dad and her mom very well and they helped me with getting in a good university since my family couldn’t really help since I am the first to finish high school. I am respectful towards them and all and since I work in construction and landscaping, I do some work around their house.  Her mom and dad invited me over for dinner and they told me they wanted me to come along with them and my girlfriend on a resort vacation lasting a week. It sounds nice and they said they had paid for me to go with them, but I feel real bad about it. Like, I wouldn’t be able to afford to go, but I saved a few hundred dollars from the past weeks of work. I do have some money to buy stuff over there, but I just feel bad and kind of emberassed that they are the ones paying for me to go. What should I do? Not go? Go with them? Apologize ? Or what? TL;DR My girlfriend’s rich family is pyingn for me to go on a vacation with them, but I feel like a burden about it.","Just a note from the other side... I’m not super rich, but I have a few friends with much less.  I like to go to expensive restaurants, and occasionally share that with a friend who normally couldn’t afford it on the regular. The thing is, it’s really not a lot of money for me, so I’m not making a huge sacrifice to pay his way. I just enjoy his company and like to see him enjoy the good cheese board!  The injustice of our income disparity makes me uncomfortable, much more than giving up a hundred bucks does. I guess I’m trying to say, be grateful for being chosen to be included, but realize the scale of the financial gift may not be that large, to them. So don’t hesitate to accept it. It’s a good deal for everyone. This is probably unnecessary advice, but don’t draw attention to the price of things or how the price makes you feel — no “OMG I can’t believe this, it’s AMAZING, wow I’d never be here if not for you guys!” Or “A $15 margarita are you SERIOUS!!?” Bringing up that disparity just leads to discomfort.  But enjoy it like the vacation it is! If it’s the best margarita you’ve ever had, say so. If the view from the hotel is gorgeous, say so... and let them vicariously enjoy treating you to something valuable — not valuable because it costs a lot, but valuable because you actually enjoy it, just like they do.",5629
c9dg8e,"Hi, my brother (a year older) and myself were products of an affair. They wanted my brother.  My father stayed married and my mother took off with my brother leaving me with friends as a toddler. She says it was because I was ugly. Father informed but not interested when I went into foster care and I stayed there until I found out who they were at 18. I've read the court papers as to my foster care.  They just didn't want me. My childhood was horrific. My father maintained contact with my mother and brother.  I have always lived 30 minutes away at most from my birth parents in the same area.  My grandmother was coincidentally my neighbour. She found out who I was through gossip and would send photos of me growing to my birth parents as a joke. She knew about the abuse and did nothing. She's dead.  I left 'home' at 17 was homeless and have done everything myself. My full and half siblings from both sides have been well looked after by my parents.  At 18+ I reached out to them and my father was remarried and made plans to see me repeatedly he never showed up for. He said it would upset his new family.  My mother had a lot more children and had forgotten about me really. I contacted them when I had my son and that was it and I heard nothing back.   UNTIL. I've been in the media a fair bit and my friends have told me that my parents have been bragging about me and taking credit for how I look and my successes.  My mother's side of the story is now that I was cruelly ripped from her breast and forced into foster care. She compares herself to the irish homes of unwed mothers and forced adoptions. Oh WOE IS HER. My father is now an example of the injustice of the court system against fathers and how this is just further proof!  Oh WOE IS HIM.  They talk about how I look like so and so and that I wouldn't be here without them. That my nieces and nephews Ive never met are 'just like me' and how I should give them the same opportunities I have had in my career. How that's what we do for 'family'. How I need to 'grow up' and get past it.  I blocked contact after they wanted things, but this nonsense spreads easily and I am sick of being whispered about.  I don't want anything off them, I want to be left alone. They want me to meet their other grandkids at parties and they've apologised for the govt/family/god possibly/ the great spaghetti monster keeping us apart. If I contact them it is further fuel for the fire. If I don't stand up for myself I look heartless and cruel.  I don't want to leave just yet as my son is finishing school soon, I just want them to stop.  Any advice? tl:dr parents terrible taking advantage of my successes how to stop them.","You can't control their actions, only your own. Block and ignore, and if someone you talk to (either at work, a friend's house, the grocery store) mentions something your parents etc may have said, you can just say: ""I'm really surprised that this is their version of the story since that is not at all what I experienced and know happened."" and then move on.",5622

I found her on Instagram through some miracle, and I requested to follow her, which she accepted. It’s not much of an update, but she is interesting! She dyes her hair pink and blue. I don’t know what she’s actually like, to be honest. Is she nice? Is she nasty? I couldn’t ever tell. I can’t find my brother. I don’t know how to spell his name. I feel guilty. I’ll admit, a big reason why I found her is because I feel guilty. I get to have my dad. All the Father’s Days go to me, she gets nothing. He left her when she was 1.  Is it bad to say I resent him for it? I’ll bet she does. I love him, but honestly? He doesn’t deserve a Father’s Day. He abandoned his role as a dad to two people. You don’t get to dish out your love accordingly. You don’t get to pick and choose which children you’ll love and which ones you’ll forget. Yes, you’re with my mum NOW, but that doesn’t make me more of a daughter than her. But you were more of a dad to me than you were to those two combined. Do you think seeing them once a year is gonna compensate? A lonely card on their birthday with some money in? Whatever, I might try to strike up a conversation with her soon but we’ll see.  **TL;DR - I found my sister on Instagram and I’m starting to resent my dad for leaving her.**","My story is very similar to yours, only I would be the forgotten sister in this situation. I think it's sweet that you are empathizing with your siblings situation. My dad straight up deleted me out of his life once he found a new family when I was about 7 years old. He never talked to me again after that. I have a lot of emotional damage from the situation, but my life turned out good regardless. I think it would be nice of you to reach out to your sister. It's ok to love your dad, because he was good to you, while also losing some respect for him not contacting his other kids. Adults aren't perfect and sometimes they make wrong choices. But we can still love them regardless. Good luck.",741
ceqq7u,"Hey all. So my brother and his fiance have been together for around 7 years now. To be honest we didn't start off great to begin with, my family and I were really nice with her and tried to treat her like part of the family. But she was just weird with us, she didn't talk to us or eat in front of us. If we went out for dinner she demanded that her and my brother have a separate table away from the rest of the family. She didn't let him go on vacation with us. She did a lot of different shit over the years, if I was talking to them and she wanted to eat they would just kick me out of the room. When our parents were away she purposefully left a mess that I would have to clean up. Planned her birthday party on the day of my birthday so he couldn't go. Rummaging through my room while I was gone. Petty stuff like that. But what was worse was what she's done to my brother, when he got with her he had a lot of friends, he's always been a happy go lucky, outgoing person. But she stopped letting him see his friends and going to family get togethers. (My other brother and sister live in a different city so we don't see them often) About two years ago they both moved in together in a city 3 hours away for university. We see him once every one or two months now which is okay. But she doesn't let him go out or have friends, which just seems so bizarre to me, I feel like he should be enjoying himself in university, but she just has him cleaning the apartment all the time. The latest thing that's happened was that my sister (27)  had an engagement party. My brother's fiance came out with this demand that either they go home with her friend before the party or that my parents drive them home (again, 6 hour drive all in all) afterwards. Oh, and she wasn't even going to the party, just him. Basically just she wasn't letting him go, she wanted to ruin the party for my sister.  He ended up going regardless and as punishment, she ignored him on the phone for two days, and that he was allowed to come home when she was away to work.  Another thing is that she's been trying to plan their wedding, even though he's expressed openly that he doesn't want to get married yet. She texted my mum from his phone (he's dyslexic and doesn't type the way she did in the text) demanding that my parents would have to give them £4,000 for the wedding. Just to clarify, this isn't some petty thing just because he's my brother. I adore my other brother's boyfriend and sister's fiance, they fit so well into the family. My family have tried so hard to make my brother's fiance fit in and feel comfortable. I don't know what to do now, he reconciled with her as soon as he went home. I don't want to associate with either of them anymore, I just feel like they bring in too much stress. Is it childish for me to just stop talking to them? The thing that pisses me off most is the engagement thing, my sister has gone through a lot and is the one person who deserves to  be happy, it hurts to know that my brother's fiance wanted to ruin that for her. TLDR: Brother's fiance controls his every move, including which friends and family he sees. Didn't let my brother go to sister's engagement party. Brother is too immature and doesn't stand up for himself. I need some advice on how to deal with them. Sorry for the super long post but I feel like you needed that context  Thanks in advance! Edit: Thank you all so much for your advice and responses. I'm sorry to hear that some of you have been through something similar. Just to explain a little more, my family didn't just lie back and let this happen, they've tried so many times to help and make him see that this behaviour isn't normal but I think he's too far deep.  He's told us that he isn't happy and I can tell he hasn't been happy for a while. He's tried to get her to change mutliple times, even asked her to go to therapy but she always gets around him again.","Wow, this girl is horrible and abusive. I can’t blame you for wanting nothing to do with her, but have you expressed these concerns to your brother?",1644
ciuine,"Tl;dr Visitors to my home keep ignoring my specific instructions to not do things, is this just how older people visiting are, or how can I be more assertive? My boyfriend (36M) and I (33F) bought an older house four years ago near a town where we moved. We're from 2 different countries, and we're living in another one. When we have visitors, they have to stay a while because it takes a while and a bit of money to get here.  I'm running into a recurring problem when we have older visitors coming, from both our families. The house we bought is not perfect and needs some work, but it’s perfectly liveable. We know we have some large expensive chuncks of renovation that will need to be done (new roof, better isolation) and we've been saving up for these. There are other problems that are small or more cosmetic that would cost some money to fix, but we chose to set these aside while saving up for the rest. My issue is that when older visitors come (and it's only older people), they decide to go off and fix my house even when I ask them not to. Example 1: Boyfriend's parents come over for a visit. There was some ivy growing on a wall outside that would need a trim within a couple month. However, our ladder is broken, and my boyfriend knows he can get a ladder from his work in a couple weeks. My father in law decides he's going to trim the ivy, and I explain to him that we don't have a safe ladder to do so, and I'll get to it in a couple weeks. I leave him alone a few minutes to take a shower, and come back outside to find him having built a completely unsafe table to stand on to reach the top of the ivy (like, even less safe than he broken ladder) and trim it. I asked him five times to come down because I could see the structure wobbling and I was terrified he'd fall and get hurt. He ignored me, and when he eventually came down smiled and said ""see, nothing happened"". I was furious. I told him I was angry at him, and even that didn't get through to him. Example 2: My dad visits with my aunt and uncle. One of the small issues with the house is that the water pressure isn't great. I know the cause, and I know it will take a plumber to have it fixed - we need to replace some pipes that are placed in a way that we need a professional. It's actually not a big bother - just don't do the dishes at the same time someone takes a shower and no one even notices the problem. my dad and uncle decide that they want to fix it anyway. I tells them not to - and explain why I know it will take a professional. Same as with my FIL - I go do something else and before I know it, they've cut the main water to fix the pipes. I go tell them to stop and they don't. Short of me physically pushing them away, I try everything to stop them, no luck. Exactly as I had planned, though, the problem can only be fixed by a professional, and long story short, they mess things enough that we have to cut the water to the whole house until a plumber can be called. It's Sunday night, so I only got someone coming around the next morning. I had to dip into the structural changes savings fund to pay the plumber, and the long term issue with the pressure is still there - we still have to replace the pipes some day. Again, I was furious at my dad and uncle, and they didn't even apologize. Example 3: my mom is over this week. She was making food in a very nice iron pan we have that we have been seasoning for over a year. This means the bottom of the pan is blackened. If this was a teflon pan, it would be a sign it's unusable, but for an iron pan, it means it's just right. I told that to my mom multiple times, but would not believe me and tried to scrub off the seasoning behind my back, causing small specks to go in the food. Again, these are not dangerous, but we do need to redo the seasoning on the pan now. She nearly destroyed the pan and would not believe me until I made her read the manufacturer's website.  I am a very conflict-avoiding person. It's already taking a lot of going against my nature to stand up to all these people and say ""no, don't do that"", but I do it every time. I'm sure there's an element of sexism here (this only happens when my boyfriend isn't home). I want to figure out how to make myself more assertive, and for all these people to just listen to me in my own home. I'm tried of getting steamrolled, and I am coming to dread those visits. Tl;dr Visitors to my home keep ignoring my specific instructions to not do things, is this just how older people visiting are, or how can I be more assertive?",Your dad and uncle need to be footing the plumbing bill.,2251
cja3l8,"\*\*EDIT: Wow, I had no idea that this would get as much traction as it has. I wish I could go and thank each of you for your thoughtful comments, but time isn't really something I have a ton of right now ;) And for those of you who said you relate, might I encourage reading ""Boundaries"" by Cloud & Townsend. Obviously this is still a huge struggle for me, but I'm thankful for the example others who have figured it out can set for us ""people pleasers"". One of my best friends of over 12 years is getting married in October and chose a college friend to be her maid of honor. There was just one weekend thrown out to have both a bridal shower and bachelorette party, in a city 600 miles away from me. Unfortunately, it is the weekend that my finals and group projects are due for graduate school and it's the first week of school for me, as I work as a behavior therapist in a school. Once I discovered this, I immediately drafted an email explaining the situation, including several other weekends that my husband and I could come up to celebrate, and apologizing profusely. I get an email back about how everyone's ""busy"", but she thought I would be the one to understand since I just got married (about a year ago) and how she went to all my festivities. Against the wishes of my husband and therapist, who I'm working with to say no during this busy time in my life, I agreed to make it work, and have made arrangements to take finals early and have working with my group to try to finish our work before we leave. The party is this coming up weekend, 4 days away. I have not been told a schedule, don't know where we're staying, how much anything will cost, etc. The MOH has been flaky with email, didn't tell me which airport to fly into (since the initial thought was bridal shower in one city and bach party in another, but who knows what the plan is now) so now I'm driving 8 hours on Friday to get there. Since the MOH hasn't been answering me, I had to text the bride asking for a plan and she said she knows nothing either, but asked if I could potentially drive people back from Bach location to bridal shower location, which would add 2 hours to my already 8 hour drive. I have no idea when I'll have wifi to look over my group project and already have to change my work schedule during the first week to accommodate this party, of which, there is literally no plan. Originally, my plan was to just suck it up and not add drama to the situation by chalking the rude email up to wedding stress and just not saying anything; however, now I'm at the point where I'm feeling such bitterness toward my friend and basically want her to know how much I'm sacrificing to be there for her and this terribly planned weekend. Do I talk to her about it? What do I even say? TL;DR Friend guilted me into attending bridal shower/bach party in a city 600 miles away from me even though I told her I had finals and it was my first week of school, as I work in a school. The party is 4 days away and there is no plan and now I'm starting to feel bitter and don't know whether to say anything or if I should, what to say.","Is your career and school really not as important as this selfish flaky friend? She's shown 0 regard for you and your situation. If it were reversed, you can be sure she'd not do a thing to make it to your party. Please reconsider and not go.  Your classes and your work are more important in the long run than a very bad friend.",4052
ck7iyh,"I’ve been with my fiancé for 3 years and plan to get married next year. We love each other and are committed to building a life and home together. But I crave intimacy and physical contact. I find myself crying to sleep most nights. We used to have sex multiple times a week, but now we have sex once a week at most. And if we do have sex, I have to initiate it. I will always initiate foreplay and will almost always give him oral sex. It is rare that he returns the favor. Almost every time, the foreplay is abruptly ended when he tells me, “just get on top”— so he can finish. Sex ends when he finishes. We only have sex when I’m on top because it’s the most pleasurable for him. Sex with him is not intimate. He lays on his back with his eyes closed. There is no touching outside of the penetration. I have to force his hands on my breasts. Sex is sterile and feels transactional. As soon as he’s done, he goes to sleep. I have never orgasmed. On the most frustrated nights, I force his hands towards my vagina so I can finish as well.  When we first started dating, he used to masturbate in bed while I would be next to him. He would masturbate before attempting to initiate sex with me. This erupted in a big fight and he no longer does this. Now I can’t help but feel like I’ve just replaced his hand.  A few weeks ago, we went camping and he couldn’t sleep. He asked to have sex so he can orgasm and sleep. That was obviously not the most romantic way to go about initiating sex. I’ve never felt so used in my life. After work every night when we are home, we will kiss each other sporadically throughout the night. His kisses are just little pecks on the lips when we’re watching tv. I barely feel his lips. I have to pull him towards me to ask for a real passionate kiss. I ask to cuddle or hug or embrace but he says it’s not comfortable for him to do so on the couch. Every night, we’ll be on the couch (not touching, with a body of space between us)  and then he will take a hit of marijuana and all of sudden will say he’s going to bed. He’ll crawl into bed as I get ready for bed. When I’m ready to sleep and get into bed, he’s already sleeping and I have to strain myself to reach over to kiss him on the lips goodnight. As we are in bed, his back is towards me. It is hard for me to fall asleep without warmth or some physical touch. I find myself grasping at a pillow and putting a pillow on my back to mimic that physical human comfort. Again, I will cry myself to sleep or go on my phone until I’m tired. At this point, he is fast asleep. He wakes up before me and I feel that he is. Every day I feel a little hope that he will grab to cuddle me. But every day he will only cuddle when he knows I’m half awake and will do so for about 5-10 minutes before jumping up to sit on the couch, go on his phone, watch espn and walk the dog. I hear these activities every morning as I lay in bed awake, with my pillows again near me for physical comfort. On weekend nights, I get the most sexual energy from him, but that is after him getting high all day. Again the sex feels very one sided, but at least he will tell me  he wants sex. The night on a sex night will end with him rolled over and again without me feeling recognized. I have tried talking to him on several occasions but it usually ends up with him yelling at me saying it’s all not true and “we do cuddle!!!” With all the yelling and the lack of change, am I doomed for a marriage with zero intimacy? TL;DR - My love language is physical touch and I’m not feeling loved.    —- Edit: A commenter asked if he shows his love in other ways. Yes, he will buy me flowers and say I love you multiple times a day. Every morning when he gets to work he sends me a kissing emoji. He will wash the dishes and has made dinner.

There are so many reasons why I love him and want to have a future with him. We respect each other as partners.

ckccmq,"[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aiyf0c/i_23f_have_always_had_intense_toxic_relationships/) A few months ago I wrote about dating an actually stable guy after only having toxic relationships. The post got more traction than I expected so I figured it might be nice to do an update. Thank you so much to everyone who replied to my post, all the replies really helped.  As it turns out, the guy I was seeing found the Reddit post, clicked that it was me, and talked to me about it. Turns out he actually felt the same way in terms of low intensity but he liked that, and I decided to keep dating him for as long as we kept having fun together.  Well, I’m happy to say that last week we celebrated being together for six months, and that we are quite madly in love with each other :)  After we talked I took the advice of some of the commenters and tried to just enjoy my time with him instead of worrying about the depth of my feelings. I soon realised that he’s a kind, thoughtful, intelligent person and we totally get each other. He makes me laugh with the most inane stuff and he thinks my dumb jokes are funny too. We can talk for hours and hours about anything at all and I rarely feel like I have to justify or explain my point of view at all - he just understands me. One of the first times I knew I was really falling in love, we were chatting in bed, and suddenly it was 3 in the morning and I realised we’d been chatting for three hours without a single awkward pause. I’ve rarely had that with anyone else, and never with a previous boyfriend.  I think most of the commenters were right. My other longest relationships were all built around toxic intensity and wild passion, and while this relationship definitely isn’t lacking in the bedroom, I’d say it’s much more built on a sort of close friendship and respect for each other. It’s certainly not as filled with longing and deep passion as other relationships I’ve had, but honestly I prefer being with him. I feel like I have not just someone to go out with or to cuddle up to, but a genuine life partner - somebody who supports me, who I can talk to about anything, someone who makes me want to be a better person. It just took me a while to realise how much better that calmer, more peaceful love is instead of the rollercoaster/intensely toxic relationships, and I almost made the mistake of thinking that it was boring and throwing it away. I really just needed time to get used to dating someone who doesn’t play games and displays his affection openly and frequently.  We did have some slight issues with communication to start with - mainly me being afraid to bring issues up/suggest things because of other boyfriends overreacting terribly in the past - but after we talked a lot he’s been very supportive and proven himself to be a mature enough adult that he can handle occasional criticism without getting super defensive. It’s been really refreshing to be in such a drama-free relationship where we can argue or talk about issues in a really healthy way.  Thank you to everyone who replied - you all helped a lot and I’m really glad I took your advice and didn’t just break up with him. I love him a lot and I can see us being together a long time. Thanks :)  **TL;DR:** Turns out I just needed to adjust to a healthy relationship. Boyfriend is great and we love each other a lot. Everything is awesome, basically.","He sounds like a keeper, I'm so happy for you!",1414
cl8svr,"I am very close to my baby sister. We share a father, but not a mother. My dad, is kinda a flighty guy. As a result, I’m more of my sister’s dad than he is. I have her so often that I have a two bedroom condo and every house hunting venture lately considers her. My girlfriend of six months doesn’t like that she’s always at my house, that she has a room, or that I do her laundry. My girlfriend was putting sheets on my bed and there was a pair of my sister’s underwear that fell out of them obviously tangled in the dryer. She lost it. She was saying our relationship is weird and I have to stop having my sister so much. Honestly, that’s not gonna happen. I love that girl, and I’m basically her dad. So I need advice in telling my probably soon to be ex that. Tl;dr girlfriend is jealous of the time I spend with my little sister and basically insinuates it’s inappropriate. How do I tell her to chill? More importantly, how do I keep her from telling other people that? Edit: we did sort of fight when she said that. I told her my sister is the age I was when my mom died and I had to go live with my dad full time. I wouldn’t wish that on any child. She knows my mom died horribly and I think she knows the impact it’s had on me Side note edit: all you ladies telling me taking care of my sister is hot are too Sweet. if only you existed in real life. Thank you","Oh my god, she's 10. Lots of women would take how much you care about your sister as a good sign. The one concern I could see cropping up is that whomever you date might end up being the surrogate step parent to your surrogate father role, and not everyone is going to be comfortable with that. But if that's the case, they should just not date you.",10275

I wanted to thank you all once more for your help and support on the situation with my brother and his now ex-fiance. I took your advice and let him know that I support him and just want him to be happy, him and the ex fiance had a huge fight and we're getting all his belongings picked up today.  He's doing really well and it will probably take him a long time to heal from this but he's the happiest and most relaxed I've seen him in a long time. After everything blew over I showed him my post and he left a little message for you all.  Heyoooo (its the brother in question) gotta say the one thung my brother got wrong was the reconiciliation for the past month. With the wool removed from over my eyes i seen what she had done to me ANDIGOTTHEFUCKOUT thank you all for the support and the advice yall amazing inspiring people yall amazing i love all yall peace ✌ Tldr: Brother got out of his toxic relationship!",Don’t be surprised if she tries to come back saying she’s changed and wants a second chance. Unless she’s gone through months of therapy and really worked on herself it’s a lie and things will just go back to the way they used to be.  Stay strong.

cmrrhv,"Original post summary: I have been in an exclusive relationship with (called “L” in post) for over 3 years, but we didn’t use titles (bf/gf). Friend (“K” in post) that knows the history of our relationship asked me to “step aside” so he could try to date L. [link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ckqgjc/repost_my_20m_friends_22m_wants_me_to_step_aside/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) I wanted to thank everyone that took the time to respond to my post and update anyone who might be interested in the outcome. I have been staying with L for about a week now, since the initial confrontation with K and thanks to people here, I was sure I wanted to ask her if she wanted to make things more official. She ended up making things even easier for me, as luck would have it. L asked me if it might make things easier if I just told K that she was my girlfriend. I jumped on that opportunity and asked if I could tell everyone she is my girlfriend, and she said yes! She and I are going to look at a few apartments this week, since I obviously need a new living situation, and we want to move in together. K and I had a few brief discussions after he told me he wanted to be with L. I had told her everything K had said to me, and she was not the least bit interested in him, which I had assumed. I also told him that she is officially my girlfriend now, so that should satisfy his concerns about me not committing to her. He refused to believe any of it without confirmation from her, in person, without me around. She initially agreed to meet with him on Sunday, with the plan that they would meet at her house (since she lives with her mom and stepdad), but he rejected that, saying he wanted to meet at the apartment, without me there. She told him she wasn’t comfortable with that, if he wanted to meet up without me or her parents there they at least had to be somewhere public. He got pissed that his threatening behavior made her feel threatened and went on a tirade, called her every name in the book. She told him she wasn’t going to see him again at all and blocked his number. He has tried reaching out to me a few times ranging from sad to aggressive, and I’m about a text or 2 away from blocking him as well. Hopefully he’ll just move on and it won’t come to that. Again, thank you to the posters who helped me navigate this situation! TL;DR- L is now officially my girlfriend and we are going to move in together. K made unreasonable requests when L agreed to discuss their friendship, then blew up at her, so she ended up blocking him. EDIT:  To clarify, we both wish him well, but neither of us want to continue a friendship with him under any circumstances. Since posting this I have also blocked him. I agree with posters that there is no point in keeping any lines of communication open anymore. I have also reached out to some friends to help get the rest of my stuff out, but I was already able to get everything important when I first left. He can make a shrine out of my old shirts if he really wants.","Gained girlfriend.  New exciting living together stage of life planned.  Identified deadweight weirdo for removal from life.  I mean, it has been stressful but the outcomes are all actually long term positives. If it hadn't been this, K's nasty side would have shown up some other way.",4214

Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight! After I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair. I went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli. But then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to ""command"" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are. You guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order. Overall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess! TLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God). EDIT: I've gotten a lot of concerned messages (which I appreciate!) telling me to watch out for Mark now and that abusers are often at their most dangerous right after a breakup. Just to ease everyone's mind: I'm staying with a classmate (who Mark does not know) for the time being, so I'm well-protected! Thanks everyone!","Well, you know what.. Fuck Mark. I'm glad to hear you're pressing charges against the cowardly little motherfucker.",4926
cny6pb,"I dont want to go into a ton of detail. The ""need to know"" is I have been out of the home the last 7 years, and during this time my two siblings have lived there still.  While I was in the home, we were mentally and physically abused by our stepfather.  We lived in trashy houses that were covered in actual garbage, including animal feces,  and just stuff EVERYWHERE.  I havent heard from my youngest sister since May. I am pretty sure she has been told to cut contact with all of us (us being her older siblings). My second to youngest sister is overweight with spinal issues and is supposed to be dieting and seeing a specialist that they do not take her to see.  I told the social worker that I wanted a check up on them because if previous deplorable conditions, and because I am not sure about any physical or mental abuse still happening in the home. It genuinely concerns me. I told them what happened with us (slammed into walls, things thrown at us, cussing, belittling our character... etc....) And told them repeatedly I really just want to know my little siblings dont have the same living conditions we had.  My husband supported me through the call, and agreed it was the right thing to do. My siblings all discussed it ahead of time with the exception of my eldest sister who moved out before things got bad and the two who live in the house. We all agreed it would at the very extreme least let them know that they were being watched and we didnt just give up on them... and maybe my Mother and SD would keep a clean house, clean nose etc.. CPS contacted my mother very quickly.  Much faster than I anticipated. I mean within 3 hours. Following this my eldest sister who lives states away and hasnt contacted me in months calls and shes freaking out on me because she ""knows Im the one who called"". I denied nothing and simply said, ""If they have nothing to hide, then they dont need to worry. Itll be over and done with pretty quickly "" to which she replied ""And if it isnt? If theyre taken away?"" I said ""Hopefully it doesnt come to that, and if it does it isnt on me. I didnt maltreat them. I didnt spread animal feces through the house. If they are clearly neglecting them, why should they have to stay in the house?"" I asked ""Would you let your children live like we did?"" She didnt answer.  I asked again, and she said ""No. Id keep a decent house but its not your job to tell someone else how to parent"".  I said ""Okay. So if this is all you called about, I think we're done here"". She told me we all needed to ""Get over what happened to us and move on with our lives!"" (She moved out long before the abuse started and wasnt around for any of it) Regardless of my personal experience, I can't help but feel like I did something wrong. I have limited to no  contact with my Mother because of her husband, and she denies any abuse ever happened to any of us... My sister asked ""Why dont you just pop in and see the conditions?"" I told her ""I cant be around (my stepfather). I refuse to subject myself to that negativity again""   While by husband and siblings agree it was the right thing to do... I still can't help feeling wrong for it.... like it ""wasnt my place"". But if it wasnt my place, whose was it?  I really would like a third party outside opinion about what I did.  Am wrong for reporting my family? Honestly, should I of just kept my mouth shut?  I don't mind having no contact with my Mother or eldest sister.  They dont even know Im nearly 4 months pregnant because of how very very little we talk as it is.  So the potential of never really having a relationship doesnt bug me really. What bugs me is not knowing if I was in the right.   TL;DR I called cps on my mother based on previous experience with being abused mentally and physically from our step father. I havent heard from my younger siblings in a while because communication had been cut. We lived with deplorable conditions, animal feces, garbage and clutter everywhere, being hit, having things thrown at us, etc. I told cps that I wasnt sure if anything was for sure happening still because again, we dont have contact, but that I wanted them to check on my siblings.  Was I totally out of line?  Edit -  I really appreciate the overwhelming response. I didnt expect this to get much attention.  I will post an update as soon as there is an update to post. Again, I really really appreciate the responses","Your sister has to believe that it wasn't your responsibility or purvue to call CPS on your mother, because otherwise she would have to confront the fact that she never did this to protect you, when you were abused. She has to believe that it wasn't so bad for you after she left, because otherwise she abandoned you and your siblings.  And she can't face that guilt. You have to be the bad one to her, so she can preserve her sense of self and innocence. Thank you and a hug from an anonymous internet stranger. You are a great person for taking action! Edit: Thank you :-)",4723
co8b4l,"7 months ago I posted about my girlfriend, her struggles with depression and how it was impacting my life and my personal needs. I got some really helpful and empathetic replies which I was really thankful for. Post can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aajrls/my_depressed_partner_27f_and_the_effect_it_has I wanted to write abit of an update, partly for those who helped but also to show that it can sometimes get better.  A couple of months back my partner was due to get her contraceptive coil removed. She struggled with irregular periods whilst on the coil so she decided that she didn't want a replacement and wanted to get back to a normal cycle.  Honestly, her mood changed almost immediately. It was so quick. As soon as it was out, she started feeling better. Her want to do fun stuff has returned, and the sex drive is slowly increasing. We have already had wayyyy more sex in 2019 than we did in the whole of last year.  She is now off meds, and even though we are going through stressful times (moving house man... NEVER AGAIN!!!!), Her moods recover to a norm far quicker. We do more family stuff now. I'm typing this from a camping holiday together, and my stepdaughter is doing well at home and at school, bringing home a brilliant report for the end of the school year. I don't want this post to come across as bragging. I just wanted to point out that it seemed that the cause of my partner's illness was a hormonal imbalance that was exacerbated by her contraceptive coil? I'm unsure of the science behind that but we are certainly doing better.  Thank you to all those who helped our situation before.  TL;DR My partner struggled with depression until her contraceptive coil was removed. Our lives have improved alot since. Thank you to all those who helped and commented!","This should always be considered when women change their reproductive system (or even as they enter into perimenopause). Thank you for posting this because a lot of people, women included, don't realize how serious this can be.  It was mind blowing for me to realize that after getting off the pill in my late 30s my PMS just went through the roof. I'm seeing a doctor about PMDD in a few weeks, and the knowledge that this is just my hormones fucking with me is so helpful. I'm not crazy. I don't suck. It's a medical condition that can be managed. I can get through this.  I'm so happy that y'all are able to get through it as well.",1564
coolef,"Original post: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b83384/i_26f_and_my_boyfriend_25m_about_to_move_together/ Long story short, we had a discussion and broke up that week. Not gonna lie, those first couple months were hard. It felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me and I was totally unsure what to do next. I was torn between sheepishly asking my company to withdraw the transfer, or going ahead and moving alone to what felt like my ex's city. Either way, the clock was ticking on my apartment lease. The anxiety was keeping me up at night and the lack of sleep only made things worse.  On top of that, it was tough knowing that I was probably the only one sad about the breakup while my ex was living his best life, partying with best friends and banging hot chicks, relieved to be rid of me. So...yeah. That felt like shit. In the meantime I threw myself into work to keep my mind off things. That's when things took a crazy turn because one of my projects garnered a lot of attention. It led to me writing a report that made its way to a member of upper management. Lo and behold, a few weeks later a management position opened up that I was uniquely qualified for...and the interviewer was that same person who liked my report. So I got the job! And when they told me that I would need to relocate to our home office in the Bay Area (I work in biotech), I was able to tell them that all my stuff was already packed and ready to go. Thanks, ex! So now, instead of Dallas, I'll be moving to the Bay Area in a few weeks. One of my best friends is coming along for the ride. We're going to make an epic road trip out of it and hit a few national parks along the way. Since we had fully expected to move in together, my SO had taken some of my belongings down with him. I've paid about $500 so far to get my shit shipped back. My kitchen stuff and some pieces of furniture are forfeit. He has yet to return my gaming consoles. We really should have split it, but I knew he'd turn that into a back-and-forth that I didn't want to deal with. Tbh, there's also enough of a difference in our budgets that $500 to me is not as big a deal as $250 would be to him. (It's yet another blessing that we never merged our finances.) I've reminded him a few times about the rest of my stuff and he keeps telling me he'll get it to me. I *really* don't want to have to come down there with a police escort to take back my property, but it's looking like I might have to. I don't know why he has to make this so difficult, but I'm getting pissed.  So if anyone has any advice to share on that... I know I'll never know his true thinking, but honestly who cares at this point? I've also decided I'm not going to try to date for another year at least. I've been told that my management role is likely to be upgraded to a director role, depending on my performance review. So work will probably take up a lot of my time. Any remaining time I have, I want to fully devote to forming friendships.  But most importantly, if you couldn't already tell, it's clear that I have some serious work to do on self-worth and boundaries. FTR, I think it's important to note that it's not like this guy was a deadbeat loser. I know it's easy to think, ""Why is this woman dating an asshole?"" when you read these posts, but it's rarely that simple. Everyone who met him loved him. We shared a lot of common interests. He was fun to be around, always happy, great to talk to, supportive of my career, a fantastic cook, very organized, came from a great family, had a good job, all of that. However, there's no denying that I was in a long-term relationship with someone who consistently took *way* more than they gave. Like, on every level. And he himself would admit that. I want to take this time to work on myself so that I never accept that kind of situation again. Buuuuut, when I do decide to put myself out there again, it's the Bay Area. God knows there will be plenty of guys around who also get Asian glow and will understand why I'm not drinking lol Cheers, everyone! 🥂 **Tl;dr** We broke up. Went through a terrible couple months. Drowned myself in work to cope. Hard work paid off and I landed a major promotion that will take me to the Bay Area instead. Learned an expensive lesson about letting an SO move your things. Hoping he doesn't make me come down there, but I know it's all going to be good in the end. Gonna take the next year to be single and work on myself, but life is looking up.","Perfect example of ""when one door closes, another opens"".",1429
cr5i0j,"Tldr: I need to tell my girlfriend that the sexual chemistry between us does not work. How do I tell her without completely destroying her self-esteem? Need advice! So my girlfriend and I have been together for about two years. We have a great emotional and mental bond and get along wonderfully. I realized that for me, the sexual chemistry was really low from the beginning. I thought we could work on that and that it would come with time. Unfortunately it did not and it breaks my heart... We have sex somewhat regularly but usually I'd rather just cuddle and watch a movie or do something else with her. Even things I loved doing with previous partner rather turns me off with her. I can't even go down on her because the taste is irritating and that was something I loved to do. As hard as it is, I feel like she deserves someone who's as much into her as she is into me. I don't want to end up in a long term relationship where both of us are unsatisfied with our sex life, even if all other domains are well. I feel like I can't give her what she wants and needs. The thought of breaking up will probably already hurt her very much. She's planning a future with me and talks constantly about moving in together, starting a family etc. I'm afraid that telling her that the sexual chemistry does not work for me will shred her self-esteem and I really want to prevent this. I think my girlfriend is wonderful and beautiful but it somehow doesn't work for me sexually. I had flings with girls which were way below here judging by the looks with which the chemistry was not an issue. So how can I explain this to my girlfriend without completely devastating her? I really hope for some advice! Edit: Holy... This blew up way more than I thought. I will try to answer as many questions as possible.   So, some clarifications: I am not 100% sure yet if a break-up is the way to go. If it is, I have not accepted it yet just now. I will therefore talk to some people in my support net and try to get some time to think on my own.    People thinking I have not tried working on this: I did. She realised that I am reluctant to sex sometimes. We tried to spice things up with toys, different places, etc. I cut down on self-enjoyment. Hell I am open to seeing a therapist. However, I am not sure if any of these things can affect the sexual chemistry.    Anyway, I will try to make up my mind as soon as possible and let her know as soon as this happend.    Thank you all for your advice! It is really appreciated.","I have been told by an ex explicitly that our sexual chemistry was bad and off and was given way too much info about what he disliked about me and what he liked about other women. It's so not necessary and it will be hurtful for no reason. It is completely reasonable to just say that the relationship isn't working for you. It's not okay for your partner to try and negotiate out of a break up. It's disrespectful and it's a violation, so if this happens you do not owe her more of an explanation.",1612
cvblpb,"Hello, everyone. [I wrote here two months ago about my relationship with my wife.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c3ms1o/i_24f_am_at_the_end_of_my_rope_with_my_wife_27f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) She was a hoarder and had a litany of other issues that were above my pay grade. I asked Reddit if I should leave by July 1, and it was unanimous that I absolutely should. I didn’t leave July 1. I left the night of June 30. The cleaning didn’t get done, surprising literally no one. We were driving to our apartment and I told her that I was really crestfallen about July 1. “Why? Is that a bad date for you or something?” I was furious, but kept it to myself. I told her how I felt, and I reminded her of my deadline. I told her that I was moving out and that I was done. She cried and cried and cried, and begged for a week to clean the apartment to “show that she was committed to this marriage”. I said that she was free to do it, but I wasn’t going to sleep there during that, and I moved in with my friend. We agreed to reassess the condition of the apartment Sunday morning.  She told me how spiritually edifying it was to clean. I was really optimistic for a bit.  Wednesday comes and my FIL calls me, frantic. He’s like a dad to me. He tells me that my wife emailed him (which she never talks to him unless she has to), and I asked why. He told me that she begged him to tell me to ‘come back home’. He remarked that it was bizarre, but I was incensed. “No, FIL, it’s not bizarre, it’s shitty. She’s trying to leverage you though our relationship to get me back.” Saturday comes and she sends me a message on Facebook saying “you know, it doesn’t look as good as I wanted it to physically, but I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress emotionally and *isn’t that what matters?*” I told her that such progress would have been appreciated two years ago, but I had to walk- I couldn’t do it any more. She spent money online with our card without informing me on yarn and we had a disagreement about it. I told her that I wanted the bank account closed, but she “couldn’t bear to see me in person”. I redirected my checks to a new account instead. It had been weeks and I finally went back to get my things and it got a lot worse. There was a water leak in the carpet, the litter boxes weren’t taken care of since I took care of them the day I left, and she managed to move the microwave into her bedroom. The latter was particularly surprising because she refused to move anything heavier than 10 lbs because of a cited rotator cuff injury for years and yet got a 40 lbs microwave into her room. I reported the conditions to my MIL, who co-signed the lease with us. She called me back to bemoan “what am I going to do about my daughter? You don’t understand how hard it is to have to think about how to take care of her!” I snapped at MIL about her nonsense. She asked me what she should do about my ex-wife, feeding her histrionic personality. I told her that I had no idea, but she signed papers 27 years ago that made it her responsibility and not mine. I’m happily living with my friend. Her and I are currently figuring out what we are, but we’re being supportive of each other and making each other lives easier. We both just celebrated birthdays (happy quarter-century!) and that was perfect.  I’ve been told that my ex-wife has had a much more rigid and stoic affect since I left. MIL told me that she didn’t even say she missed me. “It’d be nice if she came back.” I heard from FIL that they’re mad that the car I have is in my name; it was given to me as a graduation present, and was an old family car. I start my new job tomorrow. I’ve been getting ready all last week and I am so nervous but so excited. I’m really glad I left. TL;DR: My wife begged me for her last second chance, still didn’t do anything. Tried to get her dad to bend my arm to come back. She wrecked the apartment even more since I left, so I notified MIL. MIL is more concerned about herself than her daughter. I’m happy with my friend and I start my big girl job tomorrow, and thank God. EDIT: I made this clarification in the comments, but it needs to be said- I was estranged from my friend when I got with my wife. I was disowned for being gay by my family and had to immediately leave college and sought refuge with my ex-wife, and my friend and I fell out of contact. We got into contact again this year when I was interviewing for jobs in the area where she lived, not knowing that she was there. I’m trying to figure out how we’re going to be roommates in the long-term, and for how long, etc. Logistics.","You need to close the bank account you own jointly. If she overdraws and doesn’t pay, you will be just as responsible even if you didn’t make the charges! It only takes one person to close a bank account so you shouldn’t need to get her there.",2110
cx0c26,"EDIT: Ok you guys I didn't expect nearly this much attention over my dumb brain lmao. You were probably right that I take this too seriously. I did get her flowers and told her again how I really meant it and she said it's fine and it just sounded weird in the moment.  Also it's kind of annoying how many people missed that we are two women and start talking about how I said this because I'm a man or make other gendered theories, sorry but you're wrong. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Anyway it's all fine and I probably didn't need to make this post but oh well now I have silver so that's nice. ___  Ok so I'm a dumbass. She's actually my first relationship and the first person I had sex with ever, and we are like ridiculously sexually compatible. We've been dating for 5 months now but we knew each other for 2 years as friends before that, and had already developed feelings for each other for a long while. So it definitely feels quite serious already. Basically we were having sex, actually just got finished, and I just wanted to express how good it was, yknow? So I said 'babe, you're so good you're gonna ruin everybody else for me'. Basically unintentionally saying I'll definitely have sex with other people after her. big oof Like 1 millisecond after saying it my brain went 'wait.. hold on a sec.. that doesn't sound right' and she was already looking at me weirdly... she said 'wow way to ruin the moment' and then kinda tried to laugh it off and I apologized a thousand times and explained I didn't mean it that way. She tried to just laugh along and play it off like she isn't bothered but she's not a very good actress and I know she's hurt. How do I make up for saying dumb stuff I didn't actually mean that way? \_\_\_ \*\*tl,dr:\*\* I said something stupid to my GF after sex and it ruined the moment and hurt her. How can I make things better and make her believe me?","Oh cmon, this really isn't that bad. You're not married and you're in a new relationship. I'd honestly just apologise, state that it was just a dumb way of saying it was incredible sex, and move on. Don't give yourself such a hard time. I honestly wouldn't think twice if my girlfriend said that to me. It reads as someone looking for the worst interpretation of what you could be saying.",3295
cxgnob,"Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/ Thank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent. A few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog. My husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I’m home all day it shouldn’t be a problem. Which is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I’m not sure how I became blind to it. I don’t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him. We used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he’d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped. I started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I’m not a cryer the only time he’s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I’ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don’t feel important and how we don’t feel like a team anymore, that I’m worried about us. I guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog’s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We’re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I’ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now.  As for the dog, we’re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It’s nice having a dog again. TL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We’re keeping the dog.",This is a wholesome update. :),2691
czw9lk,"[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cysbos/apparently_im26f_too_perfect_for_someone_like/) I wasn't going to bother linking the original post but I guess I have to. It only attracted the attention of 2 people, one of them probably has a lot of throaways judging by my karma. Still, it's a happy ending and a teachable moment I would love to share with the world. &#x200B; In a nutshell- I met a guy I liked, found out there was an incident involving him, ran away cause I lost a close friend to a similar situation and that was too much for me to handle. A year or so later I looked him up to see if he even survived, we got back in touch and became friends. Over the years I caught feelings, he started yet another relationship. He went through a hard time and crashed at my place. We kept living together, he got better emotionally and started showering me with affection. Then I got hit by a drunk diver and got off with no complication and very easy recovery (compared to what could've been in that particular situation). While I was in the hospital he told me the incident left him disfigured. He fixed that, it's barely noticeable, you literally have to know about the remaining scar to see it but he can't stop seeing himself that way. Once I left the hospital, those tiny signs of affection got progressively bigger, to the point there wasn't a moment without physical contact. One night we were cuddled up on the couch and I went for the kiss, he shut me down by saying I'm too perfect to be wasted on someone like him. &#x200B; The actual update- The next day I went to work, he pretended last night never happened, I was freaking out cause I wanted to have the talk but didn't want to push it. Had the talk anyway and now we're together. We opened up about a lot of things. He had no idea why I ran away when I found out about the incident. He thought I knew about his injuries and didn't want him like that. I haven't spoken about my friend with anyone but a therapist, I finally told him and he understood. He said he was jumping from relationship to relationship to numb his feeling for me cause he thought I would never be able to love him back. The night I tried to make the move, it was the kiss itself that freaked him out. Turns out that sexy cheeky slightly crooked smile is nerve damage and an ex told him he's the worst kisser in the world. He's not. He's also brilliant in bed. In that one night we became closer than in the past 7 years. And I told him acting like my housewife/babysitter won't fly no more and he toned it down but he still pampers me to an extent. Right now we're like teenagers, glued at the lips, making up for lost time. He was my best friend for so long and I know he's the one for me. This felt like a relationship for months before it even started, now I got the good stuff on top of the perfect partnership we already had. So people, talk to your loved ones ffs! We wasted years beating around the bush, learn from our mistakes. &#x200B; TLDR- Communication is vital. Don't be like us, talk to the people you love, no matter how hard it is. Yes, he was that insecure. We're together now and we're making up for lost time. We will work on our issues together.",Yay! Always like a happy update! Hope you both are very happy :),765
d0fifm,"Edit: Thank you so much for your advice and kind words! I don’t think I need any more advice for now. Will probably post an update at some point.   I think I will be meeting my sister to discuss this and probably avoiding him as much as I can. Also, I will try to clean my shoes again, and if that doesn’t work I will tell him to buy me another pair and that I won’t be tolerating his abusive behavior anymore. For context: My sister (27F) is now pregnant with their 2nd child. Me and sis started really getting to know each other 4 years ago. Prior to that we didn’t really have any meaningful connection because of the age gap and other family issues. Her and BIL met and have been a couple for 5-6 years now, so he’s always been around.  He’s basically “the clown type” as I may say. He makes fun of everyone that’s not on his “superior  level” (even of my sis, calling her names when I’m around- she says she doesn’t mind). He also constantly makes fun of our father (because he’s very conservative) and jokes about him every time he gets the chance to. I’m really busy with school, but on a good month I’d probably hang out with them (at their place mostly) once a week. Me and my sis are getting along just great, have a lot to talk about and I love her a lot.  Ever since I met BIL he started making fun of me in a way that made me really sad, like “why are you so shy/ skinny/ sad? Nobody will ever like you. You have no friends because of x thing.” In a somewhat jokingly manner so that if I ever said he was being mean, he would say “oh, I’m only joking, don’t be so sensitive”. For a couple months now he started making fun of my appearance- “you have Dumbo ears”, “your nose is like a skiing slope”, “you’re as fat as a cow” (I gained a little weight but nothing serious). I think I’m fairly good looking but his words really bring me down and I start questioning it. He also started pulling pranks on me- he painted my face pink when I was about to head to a party with my other sister, and because he is much heavier then me I couldn’t get away and had to redo all of my makeup. Yesterday, I was hanging out with my other sister (18F) at their place. My BIL’s wife was at work and he came home to grab something. He enters the house and says “your belly looks like Jabba the Hutt when you laugh, you’re so fat OMG”. I didn’t say much thing back and just started packing my bag to head out. When I’m about to put on my shoes I notice he has written my dad’s name all over them in red marker.  For the first time ever, I got really mad and yelled at him. I told him that it is too much and very mean of him. So he started rubbing my shoes with alcohol and the writing is gone, but they’re still red from the marker and look like shit. I just grab them and tell him “I never want to see you again, I hate you” and left. When his wife found out, she texted me that she’s sorry for what he did- but I just didn’t reply. I’m so mad about it all. I still want to be around my sister (especially since she is pregnant and their other son always asks to see me +I love them so much).  TL;DR: my BIL makes fun of me and has pulled a really bad “prank” on me. I still want to see my sister, but not him.",Locked.

d4gz6q,"After our text convo that led to my dad calling me asking whats wrong between us I texted her about a meet up at my place.  This was the first time we actually met/hung out outside of a family gathering.  Before she came over that realization gave me a new look on our relationship.  The whole sit down went well, we actually got along and there wasn't any name calling or anything ""mean"", we talked about how we treated each other and this was the first time I've ever heard her apologize for how she treated me growing up and I did the same.  We talked about how the text convo went, and I came to the conclusion that I still had the old image of how she was when I last saw her at 17 and was using that to picture her now.  She still kinda acts the same (kinda moody but can hold it in so much better now) but its a lot better.  We talked it out and spent about half the day together just hanging out and I will admit I enjoyed it.  I don't think we will be super duper close but its a step in the right direction and there isn't a wall of tension between us anymore. Thank you all for the advice and comments it really came in handy and I appreciate it! TL;DR: Me and my sister talked it out and it went pretty well.

d6brma,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cziqqi/how_do_i_32f_protect_my_work_relationships_from_a/) Since my story got way more interest than I anticipated, I thought I'd give an update. The CEO didn't want to talk to me about Donna and I didn't bring it up in the meeting a few weeks ago. However, everything kind of came to a head last week when Gavin started telling other people on the team that a few of us, including me, were making his wife feel awkward. I think some of the original commenters predicted this would happen, albeit in a slightly different way. He didn't tell me directly and I found out from the other people who had been accused. I then decided to talk to the CEO about Gavin. \*I didn't mention Donna or her work quality\* but I wanted his advice and input on whether I was making anyone uncomfortable. I also gave my side of the story, focusing on how the accusation dampened my morale and pointing out that I feel like outsider sometimes since most people in the company are old friends. Fortunately for me, he didn't see things the same way Gavin did and said he would speak to him. After the meeting, the CEO quietly took Donna off my projects and reassigned her something small and not really connected to the core business objectives to work on. He's also now interviewing someone from outside the friends and family circle to take on the lion's share of what Donna was originally assigned to do. Gavin has been told to provide more direct support for Donna, which he seems annoyed about but obviously isn't going to fight. TL;DR: I'm lucky my CEO is a wise dude. All in all I think this is a good and fair outcome for everyone, though things with Gavin and I will almost certainly get worse. Thanks for all the advice in the original post. OMG thanks for the gold kind stranger!",That's an awesome outcome. Although how Donna still has a job in any capacity boggles my mind,1114
d6uds0,"My boyfriend has this group of friends who he has been friends with since middle school. I’ve been dating my boyfriend 7 months.  His friend is engaged to this girl and getting married this weekend. My boyfriend apparently said to his friend something like “Hey, I want to congratulate your wife-to-be and welcome her to the friend group, since you are like my brother, now she’s like my sister.”  When he initially told me this, I didn’t see it as a red flag. But last night, he comes out like this- “Babe, I need to tell you something. I’ve been texting with her every day” then proceeds to tell me she’s basically been gossiping and talking about random stuff to him. The way he said it sounded borderline confession-y imo. He started getting defensive and acting weird. I didn’t say anything to trigger that really, I just said “you know it’s interesting that you guys talk to eachother’s wives/girlfriends”(in a nice tone.)He goes “what do you mean by INTERESTING?!?!!” And proceeded to grill me and accuse me of being insecure over it. I said “let me make myself clear, I’m fine with you talking to her, text her as much as you want babe.” But his whole vibe continued to be off.  I wasn’t suspicious but now I’m starting to be. This isn’t the first time there’s been an issue with him excessively texting another girl all the time. I want to trust him but his behavior/attitude is making me uneasy. What do you think? TLDR; is it “normal” for him to be texting her this much? Edit: Everyone is saying to tell the friend and... As much as I would like to, there is no chance in hell. I can think of 99 ways that’ll backfire on me Edit again: side detail- he asked me if I would be OK with my friends texting him. I told him I would not be comfortable with that. I told him if it works for some other women in their relationships, then that’s great and I respect that. But he should also respect that I would not like it if my friends texted him constantly. He proceeded to get heated and try to convince me that I’m wrong. I told him his vigor on the topic was bizarre because he’s never even met my friends and maybe i would re-evaluate when the time came.","You could tell the friend in a way that you think its innocent...  ""I think its so great that BF and WIFE text so much, they've gotten really close in the last few weeks!""",2913
d90hrh,"Let me begin by apologizing for not interacting individually with everyone that responded to my previous post, exam time's been keeping me upto my neck in books. Thank you for your help. I'm so grateful. I talked to my sister again yesterday and explained to her that may be a stress generated problem or the possibility of her being ill for which she might need to see a psychiatrist.  It's because she requested in the first place that I do not inform our parents that I agreed to it. However, I explained to her that if she needs further treatment we will need to tell them, and she has agreed bc I spent a considerable amount of time explaining that I did not, infact, think that she was a lunatic, and that mental illnesses need to be addressed the same way physical illnesses are, and that I just want her to get better, the same way she does. I talked about the same with my brother, who concurs. She has agreed but only after first seeing a psychologist employed by her school (she went to the counselor that day and was advised to do so), whom she will be seeing today. Hopefully things will get better and I'll try my best to help explain her condition to our parents to keep them from doubting her. Truthfully, I could not have had this talk or reasoned through this situation without all of you. I am extremely thankful. ‍♀️‍♀️ Tl;dr My sister agreed to seeing a psychiatrist conditional on recommendation of a psychologist, thank you for your help Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d7wngm/my_20f_sister_13f_is_experiencing_something/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share","I'm really glad you talked to her about this- the teen years can be fairly traumatic when a mental illness manifests and there is the fear then you are one of those 'lunatics' so I'm glad you made sure to approach it in such an open way with this towards her, I'm sure she won't forget your support and wish her the best.",266

I decided I was going to talk to him one more time and set a boundary about these 'jokes' or tell him I wasn't moving in with him and that maybe we need to reevaluate the relationship. I told him I wanted to have a serious discussion and he immediately asked if I wanted to break up with him because he figured it was coming. I was taken back because I didn't expect that reaction. I didn't say anything at first, but then I told him that I wanted to talk to him about his jokes and, honestly, his behavior in general when it comes to people and making fun of them in such a mean way, especially when they ask him to stop. I also did a little reading on verbal abuse and abuse in general and things were a lot more clear.  So, he listened to me and then told me that he didn't like people trying to ""change him"" and that his last girlfriend had tried to do the same and she couldn't accept him for who he was; he thought I would be different because I was more understanding and fun. I'll admit, that is probably one of my flaws, that I try to understand everyone's position about most things and give them far too many chances, there are exceptions, but for the most part, I will try to understand someone and work with them on it. I asked him if she, his ex, and the overweight friend were the only ones who had left him over this behavior and he told me that he'd lost a lot of friends and dating was hard because women tended to cut out pretty quickly, again, in his words, because people are too sensitive and want him to change how he is. He seemed very stuck on being accepted as he is and angry about people trying to change him. I changed direction and asked him if he actually thought anything was wrong with what he said, I used my experiences, specifically, and told him about how I felt when we were looking at places and he said what he said to the potential landlords. He, of course, said they were jokes and that he'd never think less of me because of how much money I made because he kind of figured I didn't make a lot because of how I tended to do things. I asked him to elaborate and he said how I was always on things like Groupon or using coupons at stores or wanting to go out when places had specials or something and he was never around anyone who needed to do that type of thing. So, I told him that I did think he has a problem with people who earn less and don't live a similar lifestyle to him and that, maybe, he just didn't see it. That, sometimes, we are trying to be ""good"" because we have these thoughts of how we should be on the surface and we try to follow them, but when it's more close to home, our real feelings come out because we're faced with it more and I told him that was okay, but that I didn't think it would work for us, that he might be more comfortable with someone who makes the same amount as him and can contribute how he'd like. He interrupted me and told me he didn't want someone like that because he couldn't be himself around someone obsessed with money and material things (not what I said, btw); that they'd be too concerned with money and he liked me because I wasn't that way. I kind of ignored that, but it kind of told me that he either doesn't want someone who has as much ""power"" in the relationship as he has or he thinks women who want more/expect more of him are gold diggers or someone trying to take advantage in some way, I don't know. Anyway, I continued and told him that even if he felt they were just jokes, they were wearing on me and my self esteem and I couldn't live that way. I also told him that it's natural for people to not want to change when they've been a certain way for a long time and so it seems right to us, but that change can be good; that maybe therapy could be good at helping with that. I told him that it's wonderful to be accepted for who you are, but if who you are is, well, jerk-ish, people are a lot less likely to accept you unless they are also jerks and nothing good can come from a bunch of jerks getting together because they'll be toxic to other people, as well as to each other, and I told him I think he's better than that, that he deserves much better. That any woman he truly loves deserves much better than being verbally abused and made to feel like they aren't his equal or worthy. He sat there and didn't say anything for a while, just looked at me and sighed a lot. He finally said he was disappointed in me for wanting to abandon him because he thought we were true soulmates and he couldn't believe I was saying such abusive stuff about him. I was shocked he was calling me abusive because I didn't think I was being abusive by telling him why I don't want to continue if this is how he will act and that the way he acts is not, well, good. Maybe I went a little far in saying anything about a future girlfriend, but I guess I wanted to impress on him that, if his friends and partners keep leaving because of this behavior, everyone will keep leaving. The only partners willing to stay will be someone who dishes it just as well as they take it, and he knows he's actually very sensitive and wouldn't like that or it'll be someone who lacks any self esteem and he'll make her feel even worse about herself until she breaks down. Like, I could feel myself getting to that point and that's why I'm so angry and frustrated. Not only with the fact that he was now turning all this around to me being abusive, but that he still didn't really seem to get what I was saying about my feelings; it made me realize, yes, I need to leave this situation and I do feel bad about it because I do feel like I'm abandoning him, but at the same time, it just doesn't seem like my feelings or anyone's, are important to him, so why should I stay with someone who doesn't seem to get that his behavior isn't exactly such that gets people to stay in his life? I realized I probably wasn't going to get to him and the conversation itself had me shaking because I was upset and disappointed, myself. However, looking back, I could see signs that this is who he is, other people's feelings just don't mean a lot to him and doing some soul searching, I realize that I, stupidly, thought he would change over time, but waiting on that is wearing on me and our last conversation tells me that he doesn't see anything wrong with what he does, so it's unlikely he will change.  He didn't seem interested in saying anything else besides that he was sorry I felt the way I did. I told him that I thought we needed to give up on things and find someone better for ourselves elsewhere. He didn't say anything, so I just left. A few hours later I got a confusing text from him telling me that he ""hadn't seen who I was and that I had abusive tendencies"". I didn't respond and just blocked him on everything. I'm sad things ended the way they did, but it was probably for the best. I'll either be good alone or I'll find someone who I work better with. And I want to give a huge thank you to everyone who commented on my last post and sorry if I didn't get back to anyone. I've been quite torn up over this, even though it was my decision. I miss him more as a friend than a partner, but I don't think being friends would work out too well, either, so I'm just leaving it.  &#x200B; TL;DR: Tried to have a talk with my bf, didn't go well, so we broke up. Oh well.","When he started saying *you* were the one being abusive, I got scared for a second that you'd believe him.  I think he told himself you are the abusive one, so that he doesn't have to accept responsibility for the breakup in his own mind.  ""She suddenly became abusive! I was just being myself!"" In any case, good job on getting out of there. This guy had issues and wasn't willing to better himself.",4037

I finally saw him last weekend for the first time in about seven weeks (he invited me over). He seemed happy to see me at first, but things just seemed a little...off. Like we didn't know what to say to each other. I stayed with him on the Saturday night. Had a shower Sunday morning and the first thing I saw was a bottle of camellia-scented body scrub that was definitely not mine and I can't remember ever seeing it before. He lives alone. INSTANT RED FLAG. Stupidly I didn't confront him about it straight away, I wish I had. Over the next couple of days I tried to make conversation with him and he either left me on read or sent really short replies. Finally, on Wednesday night I'd had enough - and I'm not proud of how I acted but I was so hurt by the anxiety and the pain of feeling rejected - I blocked him on Facebook without any warning. The following afternoon, I got a text message *""Hey, ummm...so did you block me?""* I responded:   *I did. I give up. Life's too short to be someone's afterthought.*   *Whether you've just lost interest or whether there's somebody else (when you jump in the shower on a Sunday morning and see girly body scrub that isn't yours, you gotta wonder), or both, I really don't care. I deserve better and it's not worth feeling like a dirty little secret and feeling like shit when I could be happy by myself, or go find someone who lifts me up and genuinely wants to be in my life and vice versa. I'm angry at myself for letting this drag out for so long. I should have let go ages ago but I guess I hoped that things would get better. More fool me.* Haven't heard from him since so I guess the trash took itself out! He clearly didn't care about me at all. I'm 31 tomorrow, looks like I'll be spending it free and single!  TL;DR - saw partner for first time in 7 weeks, things seemed off, found girly body scrub in shower that didn't belong to me, saw red, blocked him on social media. Now single.","He sounds like a coward. Won't answer your messages, ignores you, but still wants to secretly stalk you on facebook. Then acts indignant when he realises he's blocked. You wrote a great response back.  You weren't sad and begging for answers, you weren't angry and accusing him of something he could deny. You just laid it out like it is: this is a sorry excuse for a relationship, and you're not going to waste anymore time on it. I'm sure your feelings are all a mess inside, but you gave a very cool, calm and collected response as to why he isn't worth any of your energy. Well done.  You handled this brilliantly.

db5f2o,Just wanted to give an [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cu7rvn/my_gf_21_often_gives_me_23_the_silent_treatment/) and say that I broke up with my girlfriend last night. She blew up at me last night and I felt like our arguments were becoming too frequent. We're meeting on Tues to have a final chat as I said I'm open to getting back with her if she changes but I'm not holding out my hope. Its hard to leave when I love her so much but sadly love doesn't equal a healthy relationship. Thanks to everyone in this subreddit that helped me to see the manipulation from her and her immaturity. Shit sucks but I'll survive. TL;DR broke up with girlfriend last night after frequent disrespect and arguing from her,"What's the purpose of the final chat? You're broken up, end of. She can't demonstrate that she's changed in a couple of days.",598
dc9a58,"First let me start off by saying my partner has been through a lot. We had been dating for 2 years and planning a life together when she was disagnosed with cancer. At the time she was in school for a dual graduate degree program and managed to finish it. Treatment was rough on her and she strugled a lot through it, and hasn't done well mentally dealing with the unfairness of it all, how different her body is after surgeries, and the fear of it coming back. All perfectly understandable, and I've been as supportive as I can throughout it all. Now all that said, she went into the graduate programs after we started dating and one of the degrees was at a very expensive school for something that was only related and not required for the work she planned on doing which would never pay very well. I questioned her about it gently at the time but she was adamant about getting the expensive degree. It was her life, and we agreed it would be fine because we could utilize public service loan forgiveness to pay off her debt that would total \~$100k. This was before cancer. I earn a considerable amount more than her, when we started dating I made \~4x and even with her degrees I make \~3x what she does. I've always been happy to spend money on her, and after having moved in together over a year ago and proposing shortly after I really went into the mindset of it being ""our"" money. When we moved in she was finishing her degrees and I covered 100% of our bills, including some tuition costs for an extra semester since she was slightly delayed by her treatment. This was totally fine because school was her job and she'd be able to contribute when she graduated and even though I make much more if we are both working full time jobs it felt fair. Now that she has graduated and started working, she is miserable at her job mostly because she is incredibly anxious that she isn't doing it well and doesn't feel like her school prepared her. She was already prone towards anxiety and depression (she takes medicine for it) but mentally she is in a very bad spot because of all this. On top of that she feels like she doesn't doing enough for her health (mostly exercise) to keep her healthy to reduce the cancer from coming back but she says she is too tired after work to do much else than occationally go on a walk. Recently she got the idea in her head to start working half weeks to give her more time to exercise, and stress her out about work less. She says not knowing for sure how long she'll live has changed her priorities about working. Before all this she was a pretty driven type a personality working multiple jobs. But working part time doesn't meet the requirements for public service loan forgiveness. We've talked about it extensively and she feels it is important for her to work part time, but I am not very comfortable with the idea for many reasons. I get where she is coming from in her needs but feel like she is looking for a quick fix to her problems that puts us in a pretty big hole financially because she is so miserable instead of fully dealing with her problems. I'd be more ok with it if it was short term while she sorted through some things but she says she just wants more time to exercise and be stress free so she doesn't know when that would end. I just feel like she is taking our relationship which is already unbalanced and asking to make it a lot more so--and soley because she is in a position to do so because of my job. We can financially afford it but I haven't been able to come to terms about the disproportionality it would create in our relationship. I am just looking for some advice on maybe a better way to think about this that would maybe make me feel more comfortable with it, some opinions on if I'm just being a greedy/selfish asshole, and some comiseration if anyone has been in a similar situation. I probably left out a lot so feel free to ask questions, this post is already very long, and if you read it all thanks for sticking with me! I obviously shared my side but I tried to not be too uneven since I think she has legitimate points but it hasn't changed my uneasiness with it. **tl;dr** My long time partner wants to start working half time to relieve her work stress and give her more time to take care of her health but it makes me uncomfortable because she has $100k of debt and it would make our relationship very unbalanced.","She needs therapy to deal with this. She can’t fix it on her own. Edit: everyone is focused on the money and the student loan debt. In my opinion this is about her mental health. She’s had her entire life rocked by the cancer. It’s changed everything for her. If she really did used to be a type A and now she’s wracked with anxiety, depression, body image issues, and imposter syndrome then she needs professional help to work through this. Just throwing pills at it won’t help. And trust me, I did the SAHM thing and said I’d exercise all the time and keep the house up and I did not. It was just a different environment to be depressed in. She should work together with a psychiatrist, therapist, and her GP to tackle these issues. She should NOT try to do it on her own.",2191
dekqs8,"My brother and I hang out a lot. We are both very into playing video games, sports, and movies. We play smash together, we go to the movies about once a month, and once in a while he stays over at my house to play video games and watch TV with me. My sister and I aren’t as close. She is more into makeup, and isn’t interested in video games much if at all. She also works as a waitress when she isn’t at school, typically 6-8 hours a day on the weekends. I still love her just as much as my brother, I just don’t think we have many common interests at this point in our lives, and our availability doesn’t match up much. I found out from my mom today that the last time I hung out with my brother, she told my parents that she feels like I don’t like her because I don’t spend as much time with her as I do with my brother. How can I make her feel more included in what my brother and I are doing, without making it too obvious that I know what she told my parents? Or should I just take her to lunch one day and tell her I know what she told them, and that she is always welcome to hang out with me?  TLDR: Sister is feeling left out because my brother and I hang out often and she doesn’t/isn’t able to join. How do I make it clear to her she is welcome to hang out with me/us any time? EDIT: Thanks for all the input guys. I reached out to her and we are going to a cider mill this week together, just her and I. I appreciate the insight/perspective and ideas for things to do with her","It's just easier for you to bond with your little bro because you guys share so many interests - if you are interested in building a stronger relationship with your lil sis, maybe try doing something she likes once in a while....or just take her someone to walk and talk, and when you think you can slip in that you'd love to see her over at your place more often, and that she's more than welcome - she's invited, if that's what she needs to hear! - to come over.",2038
dfuy2g,"Previous post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cvljeo/i_28f_am_getting_tired_of_my_bf_28m_getting_upset/). Well, Reddit. We broke up. Two weeks after I posted the above, we got into a fight because I was surprised to see him in the kitchen when I had just saw him in the bedroom. I said, ""Oh you're up!"" He responded by rolling his eyes, shrugging his shoulders and demanding, ""Is that a problem?!"" I said ""Of course not, I was just surprised!"" and went on to do the laundry. He left the kitchen and went into the bedroom. He gave me one-word answers when I tried talking to him. I guessed he needed time to himself so I went into the living room to call my friend. As I was talking to her I heard him leave the apartment.  After I finished talking to her about 20 minutes later, I went out to find him playing Pokemon Go. I tried talking to him like normal and he kept giving me one-word answers, not looking at me. I finally asked him what was wrong. He said nothing. I said to tell me. He said he didn't feel welcome in my apartment because of my ""tone."" For listeners who heard the previous fights, you'll know my ""tone"" and the ""wordings"" of my sentences were things that triggered him a lot. Even if they were innocent statements like, ""I thought you were traveling on Monday?"" or anything else that somehow threatened him and made him immediately defensive. Unlike other times, where we would launch into a fight that would last hours or DAYS because he would insist I would have a tone, I would say I didn't mean it that way, and apologize, and it wasn't enough, this time we managed to pass through it fairly unscathed (and due mostly to my patience, if I may say). But then later that day he told me how annoying my indecision was. That I could never relax.  That night I wanted to see some friends for a few hours because I had only interacted with him for several weeks at that point and I needed some social time. He said that was fine--he's always said that would be fine (as if I needed his permission). So I went out. 25 minutes away from home and nearly at my destination, he messages me about how he feels lonely, he's going back to his home country soon, he wishes I hadn't gone out, we don't have much time left together, we were supposed to spend the whole day together (this was news to me). It takes a lot of effort for me to keep down the anxiety and just enjoy time with my friends before going home. We argue for two hours about it, even though there are several times when I point out he's repeating himself, that HE said he didn't even know he would feel that way so how could I anticipate his needs? It occurred to me that he often would do that--wait until it was too late to change something, complain about it and make it my fault. Like when he accused me of leaving him alone to fend for himself at a party for an hour (it was 15 minutes, I was watching the clock knowing he was insecure and didn't like social gatherings), or that I was with my friend he didn't like the whole time (I talked to my friend for less than 5 minutes the whole night because I had one eye on the clock and the other on my boyfriend). Why didn't he get up and talk to me during the party and tell me that? Why did he wait until the party was over and we were home and he held it over my head?  Or the time we got back from a tropical island and he says he ""wishes we could have relaxed more,"" when I was the one who planned the trip and was driving and why did it not occur to him to tell me at any time he just wanted to relax somewhere? I thought it was relaxing because he was just in the car talking with me and playing Pokemon Go anyway while I was doing the driving, was it really not that relaxing? Or that time he was mad at me ALL day because he thought I was mad at him and I had made some remark that he took personally (shock), and he didn't tell me why he was being quiet until hours later and after I pryed and begged for him to tell me. This kind of shit. All the time, you guys, holy shit. The day of the reckoning. He finally leaves my country. He's back in his home country. Messages me how he feels like he failed us and he doesn't want to be home. I respond compassionately but say he needs to get rest because he's been traveling so long and hasn't eaten and I wanted to give the discussion of his feelings the time and love they needed and we couldn't when it was 3 AM there and he had to be up for work at 7 AM. He goes cold. He goes to bed. He wakes up. Still cold. One-word answers. I'm used to it now. But now I'm fed up.  I call him out on his behavior. I tell him I'm sick of him going hot and cold with me. He says I didn't ""comfort"" him the way he wanted me to. I reiterate what I had said. He reiterates that it's not what he wanted to hear.  We break up later that day. We're both sad. Despite the bad times we had good times too, otherwise it would have been easier to let go. I'm disappointed in myself for saying I still didn't recognize the emotional abuse. I said we could try again. He says we couldn't. We both cry. We both apologize. We both thank each other for the good times. Next morning. He wakes up. Pissed. Mad I didn't give him a chance. Mad he has nothing to show for our relationship. Mad at all the sacrifices he made. (Sidenote: after the last fight I posted about, he had said to me: ""I look at all the sacrifices I've made and I wonder, what have you sacrificed? Are you worth it?"" To give you an idea, that is the most hurtful thing anyone has ever said to me, and it was the beginning of the end of our relationship. I opened up my home to him, cooked him vegetarian meals, tried to introduce him to other people so he didn't feel lonely, took him out and explored the country with him, tried to cheer him up, planned all our trips...it was NEVER enough. What was I sacrificing? My time. My energy. My mental health. My personal freedom. My social time with my friends. Everything.) It was like he always expected the worst in me, and would only ever see what he wanted to see. So we haven't talked since, after he chewed me up and spit me out and accused me of never listening to his feelings and always blaming him for everything. That I should have told him how I felt sooner, that I should have heard him out on an apology (that he apparently had no intention to actually get better from, just feel bad that it happened at all and repeat the same behaviors as infinitum).   If any of this rings true to you...please get out. I started reading, ""Why Does He Do That?"" since I saw it recommended on this sub several times a day. It's opening my eyes to what I put up with. The unhealthy behaviors. The emotional abuse. The mental exhaustion I have suffered. I won't lie. I miss who he was in the beginning. The sweet guy. The promises. The love. The care. The above-and-beyond romantic gestures. But they had vanished only months into the relationship--after we exchanged I love you's--and then the jealousy came out. The insecurity. Nitpicking what I said and how I said it. Even how I apologized wasn't good enough. His controlling tendencies. He demanded I not talk to my friends about it—even after the break up he asked that I not talk to our mutual friends about our break up.  I could never make him happy. Please, please, if you read this and think it reminds you of your relationship...please know you can do better. I am single now and have been the last two weeks, but the moment we broke up I felt relief. I felt a weight being lifted off of me. I have my time again. I can do what I want, when I want, without worrying how he will feel or how he will react or how long our fight will last or trying to manage the anxiety he made me feel. It can get better.  Look up “signs of emotional abuse” and click the link with over 60 examples. Google “why does he do that PDF” and just read the first ten pages online. If it resonates with you, then know that you have taken a very essential first step towards a happier, healthier you. I know I still have some ways to go. I am still trying to convince myself it was an emotionally abusive relationship, that I was not overreacting, that I can't go back, that I can do better, that my future self deserves better, that he was not the one. I had been so sure he was. But I just have to keep trusting my gut. It's hard not messaging him. I feel pathetic for even considering it. I used to be stronger. Maybe I'm still strong. I just have to get it back. Keep practicing. Keep being strong. Anyway. Thank you for reading. tl;dr I left my emotionally abusive relationship. Thank you to everyone who messaged and helped me see what he was doing was not okay. Thank you for the brave people who post about their unhappiness with their spouses and helped me see things must be able to get better. For making me feel less alone. Just...thank you. &lt;3 Edit: The overwhelming support. I can’t keep up but I’m reading every comment. Thank you for helping to convince me I’m not crazy. Thank you for sharing your own painful stories. Thank you for reaching out and leaving comments or messages to send hope and love. Thank you for your support. You are all lovely people, and I hope you are all enjoying happy and healthy lives and relationships. Take care of yourselves.","Proud of you, OP. Hang in there. ❤️",1887
djp7r1,"To see the original story, I’ve linked it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dihwh9/i_24m_think_my_girlfriend_25f_is_cheating_on_me/) [MOVING UPDATE]: She left an hour ago and got all of her things. She brought her friend, who was also my friend too, and they were packing her stuff.  But also giggling like a couple of teenagers? All I did was sit and catch up on some emails from work, not paying attention to either of them. After about 3 hours, she had all of her things in boxes. She tried to take some things that were mine, and I told her calmly that she didn’t pay for it, so to please leave it with me. I contacted the nice couple we rent our house from and they were extremely supportive and are letting me change all of the locks, so my buddy and I are going to do that tonight. He is also helping me move my desk and electronics to the spare bedroom, since my ex used it as a closet and storage space. When she left, I finally saw some remorse, but I think she was just being nice to me because she was happy to be going to that guy’s house. She hugged me goodbye, and I let her because that’s my way of getting physical closure. Whenever she hugged me, she would run her fingers through my hair, and she did it for the last time today. As she left I felt sad, but I also felt optimistic because I can now live in peace without carrying that burden of wondering if she is cheating on me. From now on, my life is just me, my family and friends and of course my pets. Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. If anything else happens, I’ll try to remember to update. But until then, I’ll see you all around.  Edit #2: Wow thank you guys so much for the words of wisdom and support. To answer some frequently asked questions, since there’s too many responses to reply to individually I’ll post them here.  1. After this, I don’t have any intentions to ever get back together with her. She made it known who and what she wants, so I am going to put all of my energy towards my job and family and friends. Even if she does come crawling back, I will not have her number and she will have no way to contact me. 2. I wasn’t her first boyfriend but I was her first serious one. We got together when we were 19. I met her while I attended college and she worked at this restaurant just outside of campus. We were each other’s first couple milestones. Such as moving in together, getting animals together, giving a good part of our lives to each other. 3. I know there is better for me out there. Thank you guys for picking me up. For now, I will only focus on furthering my career and being the man of my family since my dad passed away in July. When it’s time for me to date, I will know. In time, I will find the right one, a great one.  4. With the suggestions of my friends and most of you, I am going to get tested Monday morning. I don’t think there was anything being passed around, but you can never be too careful. So yes, Monday morning I’m going to make sure nothing is wrong.  Edit: I appreciate the advice about how NFP is not a form of contraceptive, I get that. It’s definitely not something to do if you don’t want children. However before this cheating and sneaking around began, we were headed towards marriage (me planning on proposing for our 6 year anniversary in January) and wanting to start a family right away. For us and the state of our relationship at the time, and specifically for my latex allergy, we were comfortable with doing that. We were committed to it and had no problems or scares during the 5 years we were doing it. It doesn’t work for everyone, so please be careful. Please, guys, the last thing I want is to be scolded that I shouldn’t have used that method. I’m just looking for some pick me ups and kind words. Let’s put all that other stuff aside. Thank you.  So update as of yesterday, I asked her how come she had grown so distant. She didn’t give me any sort of answer, so I just asked. “Is there another guy?” I got her to confess she had been seeing a guy she met on tinder. She told me that I just wasn’t the one for her. She got no satisfaction from me anymore and that I was just a weight in her life that kept her down. For the record, I haven’t stopped her from pursuing her dream career, even though we sacrificed an income for her to do so. I have always been respectful of her needs and wants. I like to think I have been a decent boyfriend to her. She asked for an immediate break up, because she was gonna move some stuff into the new guys house. I told her that was fine. But she had to get her stuff out at once. I didn’t want her to come back two and three times a week to get her things. She wants nothing to do with our pets so I am keeping the cat and giving the dog to my mom, who could use some company since my dad passed away a few months ago. It’s really hard to see how cold she was. No tears or sense of regret. So tomorrow (Saturday) she is taking all of her stuff in her dad’s pickup truck and moving to that guy’s house. I asked her how long this had been going on, and she said 2 months. It’s a little bit nauseating because we had still been sleeping together in that time. I appreciate those of you looking out for me, telling me to use condoms, thanks! But we were doing that Natural Family Planning, where she tracked her fertile days and all that, so we weren’t gonna get pregnant unless we actually tried. I’m sad because this is a woman I’ve grown to love and essentially have grown with as an individual. I just can’t believe how much she’s changed over these past couple of weeks. Hopefully she finds what she truly wants and is happy. TLDR- my girlfriend I suspected of cheating on me confessed. We broke up and she is moving in with her new guy.","lol she’s moving in with a guy she met on tinder after being with someone for 5 years? when she realizes the mistake she made and begs you for another chance, remember how you’re feeling right now",6333
docv8v,"My wife (34F) and I (36M) have been together for 5 years, married for 3, and have no children.  For our first few years together, she was a full time attorney working 50-60 hours per week.  At that time, her income was approximately 40% higher than mine.  The income disparity did not bother me at all (I mean, who doesn’t like more money… hah!), but neither of us was happy about the amount of hours she had to spend at work.  When we met, she was already pretty burnt out and unhappy with the stressful job.  I tried my best to be supportive and encourage her to look for other jobs that would be less stressful.  She was open to it, but knew it would be a big pay cut.  She said she would rather stick it out for a while longer so we could pay off her student loans and save money for a new house. Once the loans were gone and we had moved into our new home, she found a part-time (\~15 hrs/wk) job working from home doing something more in line with her interests.  Her stress level went way down, and so did her income.  She still makes very good money, but her income is about a third of her previous job.  This is absolutely not a problem financially.  My income has steadily increased and she’s still bringing in plenty.  We are doing great and have no money problems.  I have no regrets about any of it. The thing is, every once in a while, she’ll mention that she feels sad that she doesn’t “contribute” because her income is so much lower than mine.  I tell her this is absolutely not true.  Not only does she still have great income, but she contributes in so many other ways.  Since she has a very flexible work schedule, she is able to do most of the household chores, takes care of errands during the day, does a lot of the shopping, etc.  She basically keeps our household running.  But I think in her mind, the work she does for our household does not make up for the loss in income. She recently found out we are eligible for health insurance through one of her attorney organization memberships.  She sent me the details, but it turned out that our current plan we have through my job is still a better deal.  I texted her and said I looked into it but we should stick with what we have.  When I got home from work, I could tell she was feeling down.  She told me she had gotten excited at the possibility that we could use something through her work and that she would be providing something major.  She was crushed when I told her we shouldn’t use it.  I felt terrible… I’m sure part of the problem is that when we met, she was independent and doing very well on her own.  I think she now feels like she has become dependent on my income, and that makes her feel bad.  Also, she went from working 60 hours/week to around 15.  So she has much more extra time to enjoy life, but I think she feels guilty about it.  I’ve told her many times that the money is not important to me, she contributes so much more than a paycheck, and I’m much happier now that we can spend more time together.  I think she understands that, but she is still hard on herself about it.  She’s not a money-grubbing person, but she has said she often thinks about all the money she has given up by quitting her high paying job and how much better off we would be financially if she stayed there.  But, luckily, she remembers how awful the work was and knows she does not want to go back to such a stressful job. I was wondering if anyone might have some advice on how I can make her feel better about her contributions to our relationship.  She knows that I’m so much happier with our current situation, but she still has issues with it internally.  I don’t know what else to do other than to keep telling her how much better things are now, even with less income.  If anyone has experienced this (on either side), I’d love to hear how you dealt with it. Thank you! TLDR: My wife’s income decreased quite a bit.  While we are doing fine financially, she said she often feels sad that she doesn’t contribute as much anymore and feels that she has become dependent on me.  I’m looking for advice on how to convince her that she contributes more than her fair share. &#x200B; Edit: I wanted to say thank you so much for all of the replies! Also, there are a couple of questions I figured I’d try to explain here: Why did she cut her hours down so drastically (60/wk to 15/wk)?  While she was working at her old job, we decided we wanted to start a family. The ideal situation was for her to get a low-hour, flexible, work-from-home job so she could be a stay at home mom with a little bit of income on the side. This job popped up and it seemed almost perfect for us. Unfortunately, the baby has not come as quickly as we had hoped (which we knew was a possibility). So we are kind of in limbo where she doesn’t want to quit her current job or start a new full-time job because she could get pregnant at any time.  Can she increase her hours from 15 to XX?  Without going into much detail, her job essentially gives her “tasks” each week. They vary in difficulty, but usually take her about 6-7 hours each. She normally gets two a week, but occasionally they have an extra for her. Unfortunately, her employer does not have enough tasks to steadily give her 3+ each week. So she’s kind of maxed out where she’s at. They are flexible in that she can request to only get one (or even zero for a short time) task a week.","I'd also remind her that there's more to ""contributing"" to the relationship than just money. I had a job some time back where I earned a great living, but the stress levels were so high that I literally had panic attacks some days! I eventually left that situation for my own sanity, and now I'm in a place where I earn less, but I'm so much happier.  The lower stress made it so I could be a better husband and father. That was (and is) worth so much more than money! Health (and mental health) >>> money.",1299
doqmn9,"Forgot to put the update in the title initially. [Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dma9rh/im_32m_trying_to_set_boundaries_with_34f/) Wife was extremely jealous one night and said I had wandering eyes when I can barely see without my glasses that she broke. Ended up sending me to the ER and she was arrested. She is concerned about what I need to do to correct her predicament when she was the one that threw the blows. Today was one of the pretrial court hearings. She was upset all night last night, saying it was my fault that she was in this situation of a felony for assaulting me and that her stress was all of my fault. She scoffed at the deal that the state was offering saying it was a death sentence for her career and our marriage. It was my understanding that a NC order would be in place while classes are being completed but would be lifted after. She was under the impression that it would last through her probation. The night prior she was upset that I was doing research on marriage counseling, saying I was thinking we were to far gone even when we talked about finding a counselor a few days before. Late nights/early morning she gets more paranoid as her medication wears off(effexor) and I try to bear her verbal assaults trying to calm her down. Having a feeling a split was imminent I packed my clothes and belongings from the place she was staying at during her NC order period while she was finishing up at court. When she got out we had another argument about what she said I needed to do to fix her situation, saying I need to spend more money on two apartments so she isn't stuck with her friend. To put her jealousy into perspective, she was uncomfortable with me having the default female google assistant that she demanded I change it to a male voice. Also she says I have wandering eyes, accusing me of checking out any woman that is anywhere and constantly questioning me if I am cheating on her. She has no respect for the privacy of my phone and searches through it, deleting so past evidence of her jealousy (breaking my glasses) and refuses me to search through her own phone trying to point out the onesidedness of her actions. When I called her out on her jealousy of the default google voice she demanded that I leave, that I had no respect for her friends house and that I had no place to argue there. After I decided to put out feelers for a divorce attorney and have started organizing my notes/evidence of her financial, physical, and emotional abuse over the course of our marriage. I have a therapist I have been seeing about some of this going on and have another appointment tomorrow. It's depressing that someone that I love would say/do things to hurt me just because of a paranoia or unhealthy jealousy. I've tried getting her the mental health help that she needs but she refuses to take the steps and initiative after getting her the information. My mom recommended me going no contact after my talking with her today and after she mentioned that my wife called her the other day, ranting about me and my faults as a husband. I have no friends locally and I feel like with the internet that the anonymity and the disconnect with personal relationship provides a cathartic relief for my situation. TLDR: Called abusive wife out on unhealthy jealousy and she told me to leave and I left. edit:  Thank you everyone for your support.  It means a lot to me since I generally feel unnoticed or cared about by anyone.",> she told me to leave. Bruh.   Take her advice and go. You're in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship.  There's no coming back from this shit.   As long as you're with her you'll never be happy.,4494
dpaj2l,"So the first thing I want to say is thank you to the people who commenting on my post  with thier experience and giving me much needed advice.  I did left out a few details in my original post because I didn't think it really matter but it turns out it did so if you want read those details go to the original post where I wrote them in the comments. You can find my original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dddq07/i_23f_am_confused_about_my_feelings_with_having/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share The Update  So it's been 25 days since my last post. After reading everyone's comments I did a much needed soul searching and I realized I do want kids but not right now. I still have things I want to do for myself and with my fiance. And plus I want to enjoy my early/middle 20s child free. Although my disorder might make it hard for me to conceive kids when I'm ready to try. I'm willing to take the chance.(fiance does know about my disorder since we started dating. ) And you guys be happy to know our families opinion about us having kids   don't matter anymore. This is  between my fiance and I to decide if/when we have kids not our families.  So my fiance and I set down to talk to see if our life goals are compatible. I said to him - I want to have kids but not right now I want to enjoy our early/middle 20s together. For now i want us to work on our relationship and ourselves, start up on savings, save up for our own place, work on our health (physically and mentally) and travel together. I want us to start talking about trying for kids in 4 years. But i also want to tell you I'm okay with not having children of my own if it's not in my cards. We can always adopt or stay childless. I'm okay with either one.  Basically I accept what the cards of fate have for me After saying my peace to him. he didn't know what to say. He ask me to give him some time to think and  I did. Later that day we came back together and finish our talk. He said- I understand what your saying and feeling. And I agree with you. We do need to work on our health , ourselves and our relationship. And I also want to travel, start up savings and save for our own place. So let's focus on that and then like you said we can start talking about trying in four years. And Im also okay with adopting or being childless.  Then we said how much we love each other and cuddle in bed.❤ TL;DR: my fiance and I finally talk to see if our life goals are the same or not. Turns out it is we're on the same page. We are now focusing on our relationship and ourselves❤","You're 23, you will grow and change some more in the following years. It's a big decision, it's EXCELLENT that you're taking that time for you and for figuring YOU out. If you wanna smooth sail the family questions, just say ""yes, we want kids, but later on"". You can keep people happy and off your back with this line until you're at least 30.",1173
dq6oky,"**EDIT #1: Oh man, this blew up more than I expected. Thanks for all the insight so far. I got a lot of responses that made me realize I did not paint a clear picture on some vital points, which I will do here and continue to add.** **a. Him saying ""I have a job"" involves a specific tone and inflection which is where the rudeness comes from.** **b. This is not his first job, nor his first job working these hours by any means. Nothing about this job is new beyond a different industry/company and the payraise.** **c. He goes out almost every night. To the bar. With or without friends. I am typically invited. I see him about once a week because of me needing time alone to do work / study, not him. I do not live with him.** **d. Him saying ""I have a job"" in this manner to our friends - not just me - is what made me see this as less of a ""he doesn't respect my job/work"" and more like a ""he doesn't realize how he comes off"" situation.**    **e. Yes, he is a functioning alcoholic. That is another conversation**. I'll try to add more as I realize what I've missed and respond to people. Thanks again.  Relationship: off/on for about 2 years. I’ve been working from home for a while (freelance) so that I can take classes I need as prereqs for a graduate program. It’s been taking like... years (3?) but I’ve also been working. I finally took on freelancing/working from home so i could take certain classes that typically conflicted w normal work hours. It’s great. It also has created a less predictable sleep/work day.  Recently my bf also got a new job which pays better and also requires more hours out of him. He used to wake at like... 10am-11 and leave work around 5 with a flexible schedule. Now he gets up at 6/7 to get to work at 8am. This is a bit of background to explain my interpretation of bf’s behavior.  My bf started saying “I have a job” as a response to things, questions, comments. Things like “You should stay over at my place” or “Are you going to bed?” or especially “Are you going to the bar tonight?” even, which he does every single night and drinks with whoever there. I used to think this kind of response was just directed at me due to my working from home and working to start a new career. And yes, I find it insulting. Just last night we were at a friend’s house gathering, sitting around the fire drinking, and he kept saying he wanted to leave (yet filled a cup full of wine for the Uber ride home), so we started to get up to go. A friend made a comment like “awww you’re leaving! I wish you’d stay!” Or something similar.  His immediate response: “I have a job!” ... almost like an incredulous response.  This friend had a brief moment of confusion and said, smiling, said I have a job too!”. My bf just kept going, saying “I have to be there at 8!” And she again responded “I have to be at my job at 8am too!” and having this look on her face like... thinking this was funny in a way? Like she’s in grad school and working and hearing him say this to her. Like, man you’re talking to a bunch of 30 year olds not some fresh college grads.  I tried to tell him that it doesn’t make sense for him to keep saying that to people... like who here doesn’t have a job? That it sounds condescending and it doesn’t make sense. He just gets offended and pissed and shuts down. I don’t know how else to explain it to him. Help? **tl;dr bf keeps saying “i have a job” as a response to  people’s comments which is weird and condescending, and he gets offended when I try to tell him this. Don’t know how to proceed**",My bigger question is that he goes to the bar every night. Every night?! I thought only husbands in sitcoms did that.,573
duiqnh,"Hi everyone! My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years now. Last night, during a conversation about our future, he disclosed that he would never marry someone that didn't believe in God. He is Muslim and, although I grew up in an extremely religious family (i.e. cult), I am an atheist. Although I'm not sure if I want to ever get married or have children (both of my parents have married 3+ times), I do want a long term partnership. BF admitted that he would not be willing to be in a long term relationship without eventually getting married. Which obviously will not happen with me.  I really love my boyfriend and thought we were in this for the long haul. I actually quite love his commitment to his religion as well, because I ask too many questions to have that type of faith. However, I'm now feeling like a bit of a placeholder until someone ""suitable"" comes along. Is it time to jump ship? TL;DR: Religious BF admitted he will never marry me because of my lack of belief in a higher power. Should I leave?","You're lucky in many ways that you've got a very clear and straightforward response from him.  Yes, move on.",6972

Life took some turns!  I never got around to asking him out as he went on sick leave due to stress shortly after the math exams. I didn't want to pester him when he was already going through something. I didn't, and don't, know him well enough for that to feel appropriate. Unfortunately I have no idea how he is doing now, but I hope he's okay.  The exams went terribly for me, speaking of. I did pass, but nerves got the best of me! Luckily the rest of my grades keep me at a good average. Anyway, it's not all bad. In the summer after my post - and after some horrible Tinder dates - I fell in love with one of my long term friends and fortunately he with me as well (to be fair I always thought he was beyond amazing)!  So, I'm in a great relationship now, we're moving in together and I will be a fully fledged teacher come January :) Thanks for all your replies though, they were really helpful at the time! Tl;dr - Didn't ask him out in the end as he went on sick leave, but life moved on and I'm in a good place, hopefully he is too.",congratz!!  Love these great updates.,525
dx5vvr,"A little background: I've been dating this foreign girl for a little over 2 months and we've had an absolutely wonderful time so far. Quite early on she already opened up that she has quite severe anxiety, but had medication and counseling to control it. Since coming here it's been really stressful for her with finding a job, a place to live, all the paperwork etc, but on top of that some of her medication is not freely available here, which she has run out of now. Once she has her medical insurance all set up, she'll be able to get other medication and go to a counselor. This week she had a couple of drinks and got drunk. She called me after and we talked about some normal things, but after a little while she began opening up a bit more about her past. She said there have been periods where she's been depressed and at times had suicidal thoughts. I didn't really know what to say, so I said that I'm real glad she didn't because otherwise I wouldn't have met this wonderful woman. She talked about missing her friends etc and I tried to comfort her a little bit. I'm not sure how to handle this situation. She apologised for saying those things over the phone, which makes me think to just forget about it. But on the other side, I really want her to know that I care a lot about her, that I want to be there for her, that she can talk with me about these things and that it won't scare me away. Let her know that I'm in it for the long haul. TL;DR: girlfriend opened up about past depression and I need advice how to deal with it.",She doesn't want to be an emotional burden. Just let her know you are there for her.,3040
dzph55,"Here is my original post just if you wanted further background. [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dqrr7d/my\_dad\_is\_moving\_in\_with\_his\_long\_term\_girlfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dqrr7d/my_dad_is_moving_in_with_his_long_term_girlfriend/) **TLDR - I have visited my Dad and his girlfriends new house, twice for a few days each time. I have felt very strange in the new situation and dynamics but they have all been very welcoming to me. Any advice on how to get pass these worries would be great. All points of views are welcome regardless of what role you play in your blended family experience (past, present or future.)** Hello everyone, I'm Mason and I am a 14 year old boy! I just wanted to update you all on the progression of my new situation since my original post. You were all so great with the advice that I really wanted to do this. So I took the advice that one or two of you gave me and decided to ask my parents if I could split my days shorter when visiting for the first time just in case I found it overwhelming. They both agreed and didn't make me feel awkward about the suggestion at all. I have completed my first set of visits and went back a second time. My Dad introduced me to my new bedroom which was a decent size. He gave me a budget and then took me out to get loads of bedroom related stuff. I really enjoyed it and it was nice to have some ownership over my new space. My Dads girlfriend cooked a pasta meal that I thoroughly enjoyed and we all had a movie night. My first night in my room felt a bit odd and I had a restless night but that soon improved. Me and her son got on well enough as usual and we had a laugh during the movie night. By the second day it still felt strange. I wanted to go back home at it was so unusual to be in the house. The realisation hit me that this would now be a regular thing. They are both very loved up and affectionate I don't really understand that feeling of weirdness about it as he has moved out a while ago and I have seen them together many times. I guess I will work through it the best I can. My Dad and her son get on really well which gave me a pang of jealousy but I really tried not to show it as I believe I am the one with the issue and not them. My Dad had given me one on one time so there was no really reason to get envious. Overall I am happy for them but I did genuinely try and any insecurities or worries I had, I put to one side and planned to wait and see how the second visit was... By the second visit I currently do feel a bit like a guest (a well treated guest) at a residence. They have a solid dynamic that I am trying to find my place in and all have in jokes that I don't really understand. I never noticed this before but I realised that they all get on extremely well and have obviously spent a lot of time together in the past. I am trying to fit into their routine and ways of doing things and I realised his girlfriends routine seems dominantly the way things are done in the house meaning she and her son get by more easily if that makes sense. I feel I need to be on my best behaviour at all times and am constantly not wanting to offend intentionally. I have a feeling my Dad stayed at their old place rather a lot and this is why they get on so well on a day to day basis. This made the green eyed monster come out. Pretty sure this is fairly normal but Reddit helps me to chill out a bit as well as the suggested writing it down on paper. I have a lot to work through and I have decided to try and be more self reliant now that I am getting older (slightly sad but cool to.) I know they will listen to my concerns if I am worried. Another piece of good advice I got on here. I have no idea why I am not level headed on certain things anymore, the emotions just pour out via my mind and then settles down. Any advice, suggestions or your own experience of this would be appreciated. Please give it to me straight, I don't need mollycoddling... EDIT (27/11/19) - I AM EXTREMELY TAKEN BACK BY ALL THE WONDERFUL AND SUPPORTIVE MESSAGES YOU GUYS AND GALS HAVE POSTED... I am sorry I have not responded yet but I have been so busy trying to take my mind off of this situation that I have barely has time to post on here. I promise I will reply soon. School journeys have been hard but are becoming more common if not demotivating. I still feel like a relative visiting. I have done chores as suggested but feel I have to do regular and daily chores so that I earn my place in the house, which I suppose is true to a degree. I still feel conflicted at seeing them together and know I need to keep trying but I just want to go back home to familiar surroundings when I am at my Dads new home.","Sounds pretty normal to me. It would feel strange and weird for anybody in your shoes. It takes time to adjust to a new living situation, regardless of the specifics. Honestly, your emotional intelligence seems above average and I'm sure you'll find a groove in this new situation that you're comfortable with, it will just take time. It sounds like you could talk to your dad about how you're doing as well (the good and the bad). It seems like he and his GF and step son were also worried about making you feel more at home with them, so I'm sure your dad will make sure your emotional needs are taken care of.",1892
e02mzl,"UPDATE: I’m super mega fucking scared but after taking all day to digest everything, I’ve decided I’m going to have a conversation about this tomorrow. I’ll keep you posted. Thank you for giving me the strength Reddit community. My fiancé (30M) had an emotional affair without realizing what an emotional affair is. He blocked her and ended all communication now after I (28F) gave him the ultimatum and after she confessed to liking him and being able to have him if she wanted to after he told her he was going to cut her off. It was about two years I was dealing with their ‘friendship’. It’s been a few months since he blocked her... And I’m now realizing I don’t know how to forgive him and forget about it all. Him permitting her calling me names, them secretly meeting up behind my back, him buying her gifts when we were struggling financially and the same year he got me nothing for my bday, them poking fun of the times I was having very dark times. I really thought I could move on because I love him so deeply and genuinely care about him. But I’m now realizing I could never trust him again like I once did and there’s a cut so deep that I’m starting to feel it’s unrepairable.  I can’t stop looking back and thinking they had more in common than we do now and that he was in love no matter how much he denies it to me or himself. She was the better one for him and I feel defeated. We seem distant now like she took a piece of him with her but no matter what he denies it and says he never viewed her like that. But in my mind he did. Letting him go hurts but staying also hurts a LOT. This has completely shattered my soul. How can I move on? What would you do or have you done in my shoes? SN: we’re financially stuck together for now too which doesn’t help TL;DR my fiancé had an emotional affair and I can’t get over it, idk what to do","I probably wouldn't be able to forgive this. Ths fact that he was mocking you behind your back and allowing his ""friend"" to call you names takes it to another level. It shows he was scornful of you. Your SO should be the person you can count on to have your back all the time, he should have defended you and shut her down every time she said mean things about you. An emotional affair is hard enough to get over, but knowing your SO dislikes you so much he would encourage and participate in mocking you is not something that should be forgiven, imo. You're spot on that he had feelings for this other woman, that's probably a big reason he willingly helped her make fun of you; he knew it was a way to make her happy. I know I couldn't stay with  a guy who would degrade me and laugh at me just to make another girl like him.",2786
e89ukg,"[Link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e0smwt/i_32f_got_broken_up_with_tonight_by_someone_29m_i/) Yesterday, I noticed the key to his house that he had given me early on in our relationship, so of course I was very sad thinking of how close we had been and how much he had seemingly wanted me to be part of his life. Then, I noticed something special of his that his mom had given to me, that I didn't feel comfortable just throwing away. I broke no contact to ask if he wanted it back, and let him know that his key was in the mail. He responded and said I could get rid of it. Knowing that he was looking at his phone, I ventured even further across the no contact line to let him know that this was so hard for me, since he had played an equal part in how close we were, and driven the relationship just as much as I had. Then he put up an emotional wall and ditched me without a real reason. His response? ""I'm sorry for shutting you out. I used you for companionship until I didn't need it any more. I don't have any more answers for you."" It's a strange hurt. It gave me what I need to never look back and fully know that I would never ever go back to someone who is so emotionally out of touch with themselves. Someone who could do that to someone. But it also is making me question people. We were good partners, and took care of each other. We never bickered and enjoyed our time together, and he just pulled the rug out from under me and revealed an incredibly selfish person. Who was I even dating? As much as I want to tell him how selfish he is, I think he knows. When I responded, I told him ""You broke my heart in the process, and this is going to be a hard wound to heal. I do appreciate the honesty."" And I think I will leave it at that, because I will never regret taking the high road. I shared so much with this person, and suddenly that person doesn't exist. At least I can intentionally move forward now. Tl;dr: Ex boyfriend who dumped me after seemingly wonderful relationship told me that he used me for companionship until he didn't feel like he needed it any more. Update 1: I want to be clear that I wasn’t looking for any specific answer, or to rekindle things. I was looking for ANY reason that would make this easier to process and move on. Thanks so much for all the comments so far. ❤️ Update 2: I in no way feel that I was manipulated. The original post was written 30 minutes after being dumped; the 2nd after 2 weeks of reflection. He is a good guy, and a decent human being. His parents have a really fucked up marriage and that has to affect his view. Either way, he clearly told me with his actions that he didn't want to be with me. My brain was stuck on his words. We talked about futures. He called me legs after ONE DATE because he felt like it was ""going somewhere"". He told me how excited he was about me, and how he had never connected so efforltessly with another person before. I don't think it was all my delusions. There was fault and hurt on both sides; nobody is a bad guy here. Everyone needs to sit down.","Stay positive. Stay busy, go out with friends, gym, work, etc...it's always hard. Some hurt more than others but keep moving. Focus on yourself moving forward and things will get better. Good luck, merry christmas, happy hanukkah...all that stuff.",1808
e8l8zb,"UPDATE: I left and I just wanted to shout it from the Mountaintops! My first and only Reddit post  is here [I need to leave my husband](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d1licq/i_know_i_need_to_leave_my_husband_but_im_feeling/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) And I am just so thankful for the insights I gained there. There was some blunt reality but it felt loving and it’s a big part of what made me realize I was fooling myself in thinking my husband would change or that his habits and behaviors wouldn’t negatively effect our kids. I was encouraged to start seeing a therapist which I did. The first one I tried ended up being a beautiful fit which I regard as nothing less than a miracle. She was blunt and insightful and gave me the courage I needed to face my guilts and fears and put my kids first.  He’s an addict. That is a lifelong battle. And because of everything else he has put me through and let me do alone, I just do not have the love necessary to want to face that battle together with him forever.  It took me just under 3 months from feeling totally conflicted to conquering my doubts, making a plan, and getting the hell out. Making that plan was seriously my biggest obstacle. And I let it be, I think I used it as a crutch. Finally, I sat there for 2 hours and went through every possibility till it just clicked and I went “duh! That can totally work!” 5 days later I took all my stuff and the kids while he was at work.  Here is what I want to share with those who face similar situations: my therapist let me know as kindly as she could that although I did a great job of protecting my kids, there was no way I could guarantee 100% that they would always be safe there. And if they ever got into any of those drugs or were harmed because of them, my kids would also be taken away from me for staying in a home where I knew those dangers were present, for subjecting them to it.  That shattered my perception of control real fast. Because its true. We cannot watch every movement every minute.  I just wanted to stand proudly and say that after 7 years of desperately clinging to any chance at happiness, equality, and a partnership, I was finally able to leave the man I have been in love with for 16 years. I truly believed with every fiber of my soul he was my one true love.  And I almost didn’t make it through the first week away...it was much more difficult than I expected having grown to hate him so much...it still hurt...but I did make it through and already I am so much happier, so much freer, my kids are more loved (he is finally giving them attention), and I can see hope for us all.  I made excuses for his behavior because I felt I could see the nuance of it all...But what others helped me realize is that some behavior needs no nuance to it. Some stuff is just fucked up no matter how you slice it. So I just wanted to encourage anyone else who is in a similar situation, you might need to start talking more about your problems so that others can help you see how little control you have and how horrible it really is. Then put yourself first, don’t let them manipulate you back in, and get the hell out if you know in your heart you should. TL;DR my husband is a lazy, selfish drug addict who I could just never quite convince myself to leave. But I finally shared my struggles with others who helped me see the real problems and accept the solution: taking the kids and GTFO. Already we are so much better off ☺️","I'm so glad you got out of there! When I left my husband after 10 years I couldn't understand why I was sad. I didn't love him, I didn't want him back but I wanted to cry for some reason. I realized that I needed to grieve the loss of the relationship that I had worked so hard on. I needed to recognize the dissapointment I felt because all my dreams of growing old with my high school sweetheart were not going to come true. I needed to forgive myself for my failed marriage because I was the only one in our marriage that was trying to make it work and one person can't do it alone. After I went through all those emotions and had a good cry about it I was refreshed and ready to build a new, better life.",418
e9op2w,"So I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. He's quite stoic, not very emotional. He has a tendency of just saying or doing anything to keep the peace and hates conflict. We've sort of fallen into a pattern of me wanting things (to talk more, to do more things etc) and him doing them 'to make me happy'. Nearly every time he does these things or I bring up that they're important to me, he says that those specific things are not important to him. Here is a list of things he's stated are not that important to him: * Physically being in the same place. We've recently gone long-distance (not far though, about two hours away from each other) and when I mention I would like to see him more or be together more, he says that being physically together isn't a big deal for him, or not 'as important as it is to me'. He says that he 'doesn't mind' going to see me, as long as it's not inconvenient. * Sex. Our life has dropped off since we first started dating (not significantly, about twice a week now instead of five or six, not a big deal). He's mentioned before that sex just isn't that important to him. It's fine and he likes it, but not a priority. He rarely initiates anymore. * Physical affection of any kind. He's not a cuddler at all, he doesn't care much for kissing (he'll mostly do it because I want it, I feel, though he hasn't stated this expressly). * Communication. Since we've been together he's stated that he doesn't feel the need for any type of meaningful communication or to talk much. He will do it to please me. * Doing activities together. He doesn't feel the need to do anything specific together. Doesn't see the point of dinners out, doesn't see the point of social events. * Holidays together. He hates holidays, doesn't see the point in them. This list goes on but these are the main ones. Also, these things came out slowly during the course of the relationship. He would do the above activities, and only later tell me he did them for me. The only activity he's ever said he enjoys doing (with me) is watching a movie together at home. He also enjoys buying little gifts for people in general) and will buy me little thoughtful gifts. Last night, he told me that he can't afford to come visit me (it is about a $50 flight) because he's decided to go to a wedding (his friend's ex-girlfriend's sister's, whom he has never met, don't ask) where he will spend way more than that. I've come to visit him twice in a row and can't travel during the period we're both free because my own sister is visiting during that time from Europe (he's close with my sister btw, and him not visiting will mean he won't see her as well). I said that two months of not seeing each other is long for me and that it sucked. I wasn't angry, but definitely upset, and I said I didn't want him to not go to the wedding (I actively encouraged him to go) but that I feel he doesn't ever put anything in our relationship on priority. He then told me again how the same things that are important to me in the relationship aren't important to him. So I said okay, you've told me many times about the things that aren't a big deal for you/aren't a priority, and that's valid. So what IS important to you within the relationship? I said it doesn't have to be the same things as mine, but surely there is something within the relationship that is sacred or a priority for you? He said that was a loaded and unfair question and refused to say anything. He then said that some of the things I stated were important to him, just not as important as they are to me, and not something he would necessarily sacrifice other things to do. I just said goodnight and hung up after that, and now don't know what to say. He is a kind person and I appreciate that he does things to make me happy, but I wish there was anything he did just because HE wanted. It must be tiring for him to constantly be doing things he doesn't want to do, and it's tiring for me to know it's always, always a chore for him. I don't know if it was bitchy of me to put him on the spot or if it's something valid that should be addressed. We are so different, but I enjoy being around him and I really do care for him. I'm just starting to feel that we are too different and want very different things. tl;dr my boyfriend has a list of things he doesn't consider super important in a relationship. I asked him during a semi-argument what he DOES consider important. He thought I was being unfair and has still not answered. edit: I really didn't expect this to blow up the way it did! Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to leave comments. I want to go through each one properly, sorry if I haven't replied to yours yet! The consensus seems to be that this isn't a relationship he's invested in and that I should cut my losses. I think this is something I've known subconsciously for a while, but to have nearly a thousand people reaffirm it makes me feel like I'm not the crazy one for once. I also think I need to visit this whole issue in therapy and explore why I feel the need to just be in a relationship, why I don't expect more for myself, and why I don't think I can do better than this.",Jeez. I don't want to sound rude but I don't know how you date him. Everything he said he feels isn't important for a relationship is incredibly important for pretty much every relationship. I also think you asking him what his list of important things is  reasonable as he certainly isnt a conventional man.,4900

I told him I wanted more communication in the relationship and told him that we could work on it together if he wanted. Essentially he told me he wanted to breakup. Didn’t want to be with me at that time because he needed to find himself and didn’t want to drag me down. Said he needed to do it by himself and he didn’t want me help. So I said that if he really wanted to end it we need to talk on the phone. So after he got off work, he called and we ended it. I told him that I’d be there for him if he needed someone to talk to. Told him he was a good guy and that I liked him as a person. He told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship right now, but he might be in the future. I put my foot down and said that I wasn’t going to wait for him. I needed that phone call for closure and to move on. I need some encouragement advice lol.  I know I’ll be fine as I’ve been through breakups before. It just hurts right now. To me, he seemed like a decent guy. But I guess things don’t always go our way. TLDR: broke up with bf of 4 months. Said he didn’t want to be in a relationship right now. I am heartbroken.","its important that you told him youre not going to wait for him, never expect this outcome, you'd only lie to yourself. as to whats next, time will heal all wounds but be sure to treat yourself, find happiness in the little things in life.",2159
ed44xf,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e3b49g/my_33_f_roommates_29_f_dog_is_literally_killing_me Thank you everyone so much for your advice. It gave me the confidence boost I needed to go to the higher ups.  My roommates behavior had progressively gotten worse after posting. She had stopped bathing the dog to protest being fired and kicked out, (also a fuck you to my allergies), she had stopped sorting recycling and started throwing trash away in the recycling bins, taking other people’s food, and several other things that just make you say WTF?!  I knew after seeing what you guys were saying and seeing that behavior from her, I had to speak up and be so loud that no one could ignore me. I also knew I had to make the hard choice of resigning and moving back home if the company wasn’t going to take my worries seriously.  Since it is company housing, I demanded a hearing with the company heads and the landlord.  I took my visit summaries from doctors appointments and told them how this needed to stop and the move out date needed sooner. If that didn’t happen I would be forced to resign.  They were appalled and they wished I would have spoken up sooner. A mistake I will never make again. They made up a new contract they made her sign pushing the move out date to Jan 25th.  They also stripped her of some company items (phone & computer) they were going to let her previously keep. She’s going to be banned from company property as well after that date. In addition to all of this, the company will be reimbursing me for any medical bills I have because of the dog allergies.  I think this is the best outcome I could have gotten realistically. Thanks you guys once again.  TL;DR update: my roommate got crazier, I went to company heads and landlord, they moved up the kick out date, gave strict sanctions, and are covering any medical bills I have because of it. Edit to add: They are hiring professional cleaners and someone to clean out the HVAC vents after Jan 25th.  Also if the roommate is still here after that date the company told me they will have locks changed and police escort them out if needed. There’s no wiggle room with this new contract.","uhh unrelated but your job gives u housing, a computer and a phone? y’all hiring??!",1115

TL;DR of original post, my bf was a man child who hardly worked and expected me to cook for him, drive him around and stay awake to watch his endlessly boring life from the sidelines. I refused to accept the fact I needed to grow up and leave him.  I was completely oblivious to all the problems in our relationship and I refused to leave Tom even though it was very clearly the right thing to do. I broke up with him maybe 6 months after I posted but we got back together even though I was moving to another country to teach English for a few months. While I was away he hardly ever spoke to me, never asked me how I was and grew increasingly disrespectful to me. I came back home early because I felt bad leaving him for so long.  We had plans to move overseas together but he was getting cold feet saying he didn't want to leave his best friend. I broke up with him again and decided to move overseas by myself. It was terrifying to be alone after being with Tom for so long but it was 100% the right decision. Turns out he had started sleeping with his best friend while I was overseas teaching English.  Also turns out I'm a lesbian, so there's that.  Tom still lives at my dad's place and works the same job, I've just bought my first flat and I'm having a wonderful time living overseas and being truly independent. I have grown so much in the last few years and done things I could never imagine doing while I was stuck in a dead end relationship. I know now that being alone is so much better than being with someone who doesn't love you.  TL;DR I was in a terrible relationship with a guy that took advantage of me and was never willing to grow up, I was terrified of being by myself but it was the best decision I could've made for myself!",So proud of you!! All of that plus moving to a different country? That’s really great and I hope you’re much happier now,1256

First off, thank you for all the replies. Emotional manipulation is hard especially in a relationship. For me, I like to see the goodness in people and I trust people, which are great qualities, it can also set me up as a target. Thank you for confirming what I was seeing and feeling, it's difficult to see these abuse tactics from inside, so much so that you start to actually think what this person is speaking truth because why would they tell you differently. I mean why would your partner be intentionally hurtful? On to the update I didn't want to ghost him because I think that's mean so I sent him a short text that said ""I don't feel that we should see each other anymore. I wish you the best of luck."" He sent me a couple of wtf texts, with the last one saying ""you didn't honor your promise to me. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings but you don't keep promises."" Followed up with ""I'm a really awesome person, you'll come to your senses and figure it out. Let me know when you are brave enough to be an adult relationship."" Ending with that ""I don't deserve to be treated this way and I will not tolerate it but you're amazing and I love you. Please don't contact me again""  There was more, it was pretty lengthy but that's the core of the message. I read it and said oh okay, don't worry to myself and blocked him. So not a big drama, it's just over and I'm done. I'm going to take some time to myself and do some home projects that I've been meaning to work on and enjoy the holidays with my friends and family. Tl,Dr I broke with him and said some stuff, I blocked him and taking time for myself  ETA:I just woke up and was reading all the comments while drinking my morning coffee. I wanted to say thank you to all of you for your kind words. I'm really touched by your words of encouragement and shared experiences.  Thank you to the kind stranger for the gold!  We don't know each other but I truly feel like I have a hundred people in my corner supporting me, it's feels really good. So thank you! I also want to let you all know that I have blocked him on all forms of communication IG, FB, text, email, the works! But I'm totally prepared if he ever tries to reach out again, I think silence is the best road to take on this one.  Thank you again for the support, it means more than I can express. I hope all of you have a wonderful holiday and 2020 is everything that you want it to be!","I honestly felt kind of proud reading this update. Good for you! I think you’re really putting your foot down and showing yourself that you won’t accept to be treated badly, and only good things can stem from that.

Unfortunately, I found out two days ago that he had other girls he was using as backup girlfriends and I - as embarrassing as it sounds - flipped my shit and I left him. The reason he started being less affectionate with me was, apparently, because he was sharing / outsourcing his emotional needs to other girls while not fulfilling mine. So, that's the end of a 3.5 years relationship. I'm feeling strangely well although it happened recently so maybe it hasn't hit me yet. I'm more angry than anything else. Thank you for reading, r/relationships! **TL;DR:** The lack of affection was, apparently, because he was entertaining other girls in case we didn't work out so I left him. (Reposted because I forgot summary) **Edit:** Wow, this really blew up. I was spending time with my family and haven't checked my post. Thank you for the encouragements, advice and gold. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can.","Why are you embarrassed you left him? Cheating is never worth forgiving. You both are young, it would be amazing if it lasted forever.

It was super hard cause I sat in the seat he always sat on and I just broke down crying. I am forever grateful for both my step sister and step mom cause we all just had a group hug on her couch while I bawled my eyes out. It ended and we didn't open presents but just talked. We had brunch and it went well tho I was holding in tears for the whole thing, this was the first time I could see they actually do care for me and I care for them. They are my family, I didn't stay the night cause I def couldn't do that but I left around 11 at night. This was the first time I ever felt like a full family unit and not the bad kid who fought with my step mom was just wasn't the nicest to my step sister. I thank them so much for not holding a grudge when I went through my teen rebel phase. I hugged them both goodbye and went home, I feel like me giving them a shot and going to my dad's place helped me realize that these are the people who have always been there for me. I mean they were the ones who didn't give up on me when I was a troubled teen and I love them both for it. I talk with my step sister almost daily now even if its just a good morning text and I call my step mom a bit too now.

ek1kth,"We have often argued during our marriage (of 7 years), but resentment has been building this year, along with many stressors. My father passed away at the beginning of 2019. Husband was laid off in April and had a very hard time finding another job. At his new job, I felt he was becoming far too cozy with a secretary and it led to a lot of arguments. &#x200B; Yesterday we got into what should have been a minor disagreement. Instead, it's like the floodgates of resentment on both our sides opened and we both just escalated the fight. &#x200B; We ended up saying things I don't think can be ever taken back. I know I was saying things that I felt were true but had never really said. I assume he was doing the same. Some of the things that were said: &#x200B; \- he told me I was fat and always miserable and he was far happier at work than at home around me. \- I told him other men hit on me and obviously don't feel I'm too fat, and I told him he wasn't nearly hot enough to call me fat. \- he told me that I was lazy and boring and that anyone hitting on me was probably just looking for a hook-up and would quickly become turned off by my personality. \- I told him that at least I didn't act inappropriately with other men because, unlike him, I am respectful of our marriage and quickly shut stuff down rather than flirting with the office slut. \- He said at least she was fun and kind and had a beautiful body, so when he had to come home to me every night of course he flirted with her at work because she was a nicer person than me and hotter than me. \- I told him she could have him because he was a boring, lazy lover anyway and I'm sure after she sampled his ""technique"" she would quickly lose interest. \- he then told me he was boring and lazy with me in bed because he found me gross and he's never been attracted to my body and he only has sex with me when he really wants to cum, but he just wants to get it over with quickly. &#x200B; I'm ashamed of how we acted. But the nasty soul-crushing things we said to each other -- I'm guessing we can't come back from that, right? I can't imagine having sex with him again now. Is this something that we could work through in counselling? Or should we call it a day and move forward to separate? &#x200B; **tldr: after months of stress and resentment, a mundane argument exploded into vicious verbal insults between my husband and I where we attacked each other's insecurities....need to know if it's fixable.**","Two relevant questions: do you WANT to fix it?  Does he?  If either of you answer ""no"", then no amount of counseling will help.",4333
eo6ykz,"Really quick update to this [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/elwlz8/should_my_brother_17m_and_i_17f_invite_my/) My twin brother and I talked to my oldest brother yesterday about inviting the brother and sister over for Chinese New Year because they didn't have any family. He just laughed at us and said yes, it was fine and said he knew exactly what we were up to with the baker/brother but in like a really smirky kind of way.  I think they've already been talking or maybe even dating but he refused to say any more than that and kept telling us to get ready for school and that ""good things take time"" and acting all ""wise"" and ""older brotherly"" and just annoying.  So I told him he'd better get married by the end of the year so I could get more red pockets next Chinese New Year and he just laughed at me.  When I went to the cafe after school today his crush told me that my brother had invited them over for Chinese New Year so I was ""oh really?"" and he kind of laughed at me too and told me I was a good sibling.  So they are clearly together or together adjacent or something. Maybe they want to announce it on Chinese New Year. But when my brother asked me what I wanted to eat on Chinese New Year I gave him a list of wedding foods and he asked me if I was getting married. But he's just been laughing at me and my brother the whole time.  So we've just been annoying each other back and forth until he bought us ice cream to shut us up but he did give us hugs out of the blue today so I think I'll just leave it at that and they can take their own time with whatever it is they have going on. But I do kind of want to tease him about it because I have little sister privileges and I can only abuse them for another year.     ---      **tl;dr**: Update, looks like there's already something going on and they are coming for Chinese New Year but my brother is being coy.","Haha, they're clearly dating.

I was encouraged to do the dangerous thing and talk to her.

As the months went by we both started seeing other people although I was still very much in love with her. Eventually both of us realised that we didn't want other people but only each other and a short time after that we got together. We have now been dating for 10 months and we are both extremely happy and are very much in love. Just wanted to make an appreciation post for the ones who made me talk to her and to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was, it actually is possible!

Update: Things have been really good since I made my last post!! My mom and I sat down and made plans to get some board games, that are 2 player+, so we can all play together, even if someone is out of the house. She is also considering picking out some video games that interest her so she can learn the system, and is open to trying my games out as well. My stepdad and I have been individually hanging out with her on her time off.  I wanted to also follow up on a question I received on my previous post about if she was truly feeling left out: I could tell just by her demeanor that she was a bit distant during the time that my stepdad and I played games together. But also, I think I may have been projecting my own feelings and maybe making the situation worse than it was, since I will never know how she truly felt. This question really made me think about the deeper aspect to the situation, and as I said before, my mom is my best friend. I came to realize that I was also feeling a bit disconnected from her and missing her presence. It’s perfectly fine to have our own hobbies individually but in this case I think there was just prolonged isolation that led to insecurity, from my own side at least. I can’t say that the situation is perfect and resolved yet but there is definitely progress being made! And that is relieving. I’m excited to have these future bonding times as a whole.  Thank you to everyone who weighed in and took time out of their day to help me out. It truly means a lot.  TLDR; We made plans to hang out together more.

er9lo4,"link to the original post: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9y9dvs/i_caught_my_24f_boyfriend_26m_talking_to/) I wasted another year of my life by trying to help a person that never helped themselves and I'm paying for it in every way imaginable. I introduced him to the r/stopfindom subreddit, we went to therapy three times (only initiated when I caught him), I tried avoiding it, I tried confronting him. Nothing worked because he never stopped""the cycle."" I was going to study abroad in Asia in December and I did not need this on my mind before I went. So very impromptu on Nov. 16, I decided I could not be with him anymore.  I was sick of feeling used and lied to about something that he didn't need to lie about. I didn't have solid proof. I just had it mentally because I felt he was hiding something from me. And he wasn't trying to fix our relationship at all, even though he swears up and down he did. Instead of handling it well, he shows me an engagement ring his mom gave to him as I was breaking up with him and begged me to stay again. We didn't speak at all while I was away and I wish it stayed that way. I came back early January and our lease isn't up until February so I decided we could live together until then. And it was great until Monday, or at least I thought so anyway. We were talking openly about our feelings and he kept apologizing for everything that went wrong.  He still wanted to be my friend. (Hard no.) It wasn't until this last Monday, that he got a new phone and switched over his sim card to his new one. While he was at work his old phone kept going off so I looked at it. I fully acknowledge that since we aren't together I had no right to go through his phone but the shit I found makes me feel no guilt what so ever. If anything, I'm proud I can see him for who he actually is. I found out he went to see one of the doms he was cheating on me with in LA and never stopped talking to her, even before we broke up. And in $15K in debt from sending multiple doms money (SN: he always told me one of the traits he doesn't like about me is how badly I handle money. HAR HAR. Projecting much?) After I saw this I puked, packed a bag and left. I texted him that I am leaving and unless it was about the apartment, I never wanted to hear from him again.  We've been avoiding each other since. I've been slowly moving my things out and putting it in storage and I just feel emotionally defeated. I went through three months worth of messages and found a few interesting things other than the nudes, videos and pretty subpar sexting. He acknowledges that he lied and that he had an intimate connection with her. To which she replies, "" That's called deceit not cheating."" He's glad that it was her. Glad that he can finally make someone happy. Glad he can please his goddess. Glad to be ""free"". Upset that I never understood him. wow. what a goof lol. He is so disillusioned and addicted to this lifestyle that he genuinely believes she cares about him and that he's in the right. He thinks she's actually his friend, while she goes out to dinner with her boyfriend with his money and using him for emotional support (something he complained about to her about me. And how he loved emotionally fucking with me.) She is being paid thousands of dollars to stroke their ego though, so I think I would understand that you have to keep the customer happy. She got $500 off of that LA visit which is pretty impressive if you ask me. I feel like I should say that I respect sex workers and everything they do A LOT. But this specific dom is manipulative and has no boundaries. She is a half baked amateur at best who really has no clue on how to even pretend to know what she's doing. She gives actual doms a bad name. Anyone who is a proper dom and actually cared about their subs well being would never do the shit that these two concocted. Like sending me a picture of her ass and saying she only did it because he asked her to. Asking him how he's going to spoil me today and him telling her that he's going to take me to get my nails done as a surprise. Him telling her how unappreciative I am of his gifts because they don't feel genuine (which they weren't lol.) I never consented to any of this and this shit has fucked me up for life. But get this, she's an advocate for mental wellness. What a joke. She praised him for getting out of a toxic relationship and was glad he could be ""free"" from all of my nagging and that I wouldn't hold this over his head anymore. (again, either she's really good at customer satisfaction or a really shitty person. More than likely both.) But he never told her that I was the one who actually ended the relationship. But yeah, he never changed. He talked a big game but is so deep into his addiction and himself that he's willing to risk everything for it. I should have listened to everyone's advice and left when I had the chance. I shouldn't have moved in with him. Instead, I was emotionally abused by a narcissist who felt that ""he did everything he could."" A direct quote he said to the findom he never stopped talking to for the past six months. To those that are questioning and still have hope for the hopeless, get out while you can. You can’t change anyone that does not want to change themselves. You can’t convince someone they’re in the wrong once they see that they’re in the right. You may think that other people may not know them as well as you do. It’s just something you tell yourself to avoid the actual truth that you’re sacrificing yourself for someone who won’t even do the same for you. Take care of yourself first because you’re only damaging yourself in the long run. Sorry if this looks all over the place btw. As happy as I am that I made the decision to leave, I am super depressed and feel like I failed. I know this is all his fault, but I feel like I should have seen this coming. That besides this one thing, he was amazing. But it was a lie. Reddit really helped me the last time and that’s the only reason I’m posting here.  Because I haven’t slept in the past three days and could really use some support and will probably regret posting this later lol. &#x200B; &#x200B; tldr; I left my lying findom addicted ex and while I'm emotionally destroyed and angry, I'm glad I left. Send good vibes. &#x200B; **Update:** Holy Canoli! I went to sleep and came back to 1.0 k upvotes. Thank you for the Platinum and the Silver! I truly appreciate it. The comments are overwhelming and I'm trying to upvote them all but I am beyond grateful. &#x200B; A couple of notes: * For those that don't want to google, **findom is financial domination**. A more direct definition is ***financial domination*** *is also known as money slavery and is basically a fetish of people who want to be controlled by another person in exchange for money. They pay people for controlling them and the one in charge is known as a financial dominatrix. Usually, a male is the submissive who is referred to as a pay pig, a money slave, and even a human ATM because the findom can shell out as much money as they can from these subs.* * I don't have a problem with findom. We actually tried it together. I was uncomfortable with it mainly because I linked it with his cheating and lying. I expressed that I wanted to be monogamous and he stated that he wanted ""help"" and felt ""sick"" and wanted to change. I said that if this is what he wants to do that's fine, I'm fine with that but I don't want to be deceived and used. Just communicate with me. But as I found out from the messages, he loved emotionally manipulating me and loved to see me hurt. He got off on my pain, a direct quote. He got off on mentally abusing me, and that's not ok. * He also had a homewrecking fetish but I guess it loses the appeal if I consent to it I guess. * mini-rant: **DON'T DO THIS TO PARTNERS WHO HAVE NO INTEREST IN YOUR KINK OR YOU HAVE NOT HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM ON WHAT THEY ARE OK WITHIN THE RELATIONSHIP. COMMUNICATE! GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO DECIDE ON WHAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH, NOT WHAT YOU THINK THEY'RE OK WITH. DON'T HURT SOMEONE ELSE IF THEY EXPRESS DISINTEREST AND GIVE YOU AN OPEN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE, BUT YOU ARE SO SELFISH THAT YOU RATHER LIE TO THEM AND PUT ON A FACADE OF ""WANTING HELP"".** * you can probably find his post on r/stopfindom. I won't link it here but if you're curious it may be still there from like a year ago.","im so so proud of you. leaving people is hard, especially when they beg you to stay. i can tell you're a great person and you did your best to keep the relationship alive. you can't stop other people's actions even if you wanted to. im still learning that. if he wanted to put effort into stopping, he would. i know you'll be way better off without him even if it doesnt feel like it right now. and im sending good vibes your way and hoping the healing process doesnt take long.",1000
esit2d,"Hi all! I wanted to thank you for all of your responses on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ep3scw/my_22f_boyfriend_32m_has_trouble_controlling_his/). I got so much support and I feel that it's appropriate to do an update. Posting anonymously on this subreddit was a huge step for me. So many people were blunt and honest about the reality of the situation based on what I posted. I have felt hurt for so long, and it felt great to get some feedback and support. After I posted here, I soon told my therapist and even read most of your responses out loud to her. It was eye opening to me, and she agreed that I'm in an abusive situation and it's not my job to wait around for this person to change. She also recognized the gaslighting and manipulation that was involved which was hard for me to accept at first. When I talked to my boyfriend about my concerns things got pretty ugly. He didn't respond to it well, and we talked back and forth for about a week over text and phone. At times he was apologetic, at other times he minimized my feelings even more and tried to justify his behavior. (At one point he said it was ""ignorant and selfish"" of me to criticize his ""mental health issues""...okay?) Guilting, manipulation, even gaslighting. I couldn't take it anymore. Oh yeah, and when I stood my ground and repeated the statement ""I felt intimidated and afraid when you blared on the horn, threw the change, and yelled at me,"" he had the nerve to say (this is all over text mind you, and my friends/therapist agreed I was communicating very reasonably) ""I feel scared and intimidated by you right now, this whole convo is triggering"" lmfao??? Are you for real? Throughout all of the back and forth since the initial incident happened (the rage fit) I finally opened up to my close friends and all of them were hugely supportive of me and attentive to listen. They didn't know the extent of his rage and agreed that this was unhealthy. It felt really good to open up to them, for so long I wanted to defend this person's behavior. I broke up with him last night. My friends and even my dad agreed that I don't owe it to this person to break up in person, so I did it through text, exchanged goodbyes, and blocked him on every platform. I'm excited to move on in my life and focus on my schooling, friends, and just myself in general. Thank you all again for the support and feedback, I needed it. I feel like my life has been changed for the better and the responses I got were huge for me to take that step.  \*\*TL;DR;\*\* Listened to y'alls advice, dumped his ass, and I'm moving on. Thank you again!! <3",Omg of course he flipped the script.  I hate the whole “well this conversation is “x” so you’re behavior is bad too!” Bullshit.  With abusive people they expect you to take their shit indefinitely.  They can’t handle feeling bad at all so they can’t and won’t take any responsibility.  Congrats on being brave enough to leave.,771
etl7ge,"I've been dating my current bf for a year now. We have been long distance since the start of 2018. He recently went back to his home country and on the second day of his trip, went out for drinks with his friends. His ex showed up at the club with her current  bf and since they haven't seen each other for more than a year, it made sense for the two of them to say hi to each other. One thing led to another and an argument started. My BF left the club feeling disappointed and too drunk of course. He gets to the house and calls me telling me how heart broken he is. As a good gf of course I ask what the issue is. Only to find out that his ex moved on too quick and her presence still hurts him. One year has gone to waste. Feeling really hurt. At this point I feel like breaking up with him is the only solution. You really can't be with someone who hasn't moved on. I really do love him very much but it's really hurts knowing that he still loves his ex. What do I do? Tldr; My bf just called me to tell me his ex gf moved on too fast. Should I break up with him?",I can understand having a sad drunk moment when you see your ex for the first time after a break up. It does seem like a lot though - you guys have been together for a year and he’s concerned his ex moved on too quickly?? Idk have a sober chat but be suspicious,3251
eubfeu,"This is in response to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e9op2w/i_25f_asked_my_so_25m_what_i_thought_was_a/) post, which received an overwhelming and surprising response.  After the events of the post, I sent my boyfriend an email (after we spoke on the phone and I voiced all my concerns), essentially saying that I loved him but we had different needs. He wrote me a long email back, which was very surprising to me since he doesn't like to show emotion in any way. He said he feels as if he's become a shell of a person and that he would really like to work on things. I agreed to try, vowing to myself that something major had to change. During all this, I bought 'Attached' by Amir Levine (after a few commenters suggested it). It completely changed my outlook. I identified so strongly with the anxious attachment style and I really felt my boyfriend was avoidant. A lot of our problems made sense. I started to work on sorting through those issues individually in therapy. I tried to put a stop to my protest behaviours completely (threatening to leave during fights, ignoring messages in hopes that he'll 'miss me', asking for reassurance often). I even recommended that he read the book. He read the first chapter and immediately agreed that we were anxious/avoidant. Over a month later, I've felt a growing distance. The future is looming and decisions need to be made. I started doing more without him. Looking at flats alone for once. Yesterday, after weeks of not discussing 'the relationship', I asked him if he felt a disconnect too and he said he did and was glad I said it. We then agreed that it wasn't working and likely never would due to our differences.  I'm pretty devastated. We ended on incredibly good terms and I still think the world of him. It's hard for me to know if I'm doing the right thing or if I expect too much. He's such a stable, solid, kind presence in my life and I feel thoroughly alone. I do realise that I went through this for a reason, it's just hard to remember that right now. It's just very raw at the moment. I'm hoping time heals all wounds and this isn't something I grow to regret.  Thank you to everyone for your support on the last post. It's really helped me get through all this so far. I go back and read the comments every time I wonder why I went through with this.  tl;dr I tried to make it work with my boyfriend after realising we have different needs. It didn't work out and we ended civilly. I'm feeling shattered and scared, but hopeful I made the right decision.",It sounds like you made the right decision. Be kind to yourself during this time :),4854
eus9hn,"Here is a [LINK TO ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/epmnay/my_26f_ex_boyfriend_27m_and_roommate_25f_are/) In summary, my ex and my roommate decided that they will continue to hang out together.  So, the past week has been really hard for me. I am thankful that my boss is giving me 2 days off to recover and get back on my feet. Forty-eight hours after the breakup, I talked to my roommate and she said that while she understands how I feel, she will continue hanging out with him. I also talked to my ex and told him how uncomfortable I feel about the whole thing. He also said he understands, but thinks it's controlling of me to ask them not to hang out. Last week, they hung out for 5 days, for hours on end. They did respect my requests not to come inside the house when together, which I appreciate.  Many posters suggested that they were having an affair. My ex claims that he did not break up with me to get with her. I did believe him at first, and maybe it was somewhat true, but I now think that something is going on and was going on. I found out that my roommate had a crush on my ex, while were were dating, yet still continued to hang out with him alone (while we were dating). I asked my ex while we were still dating if we could hang out just the two of us a little bit more, and I was accused then of being jealous and controlling. Turns out I was onto something. I suspect they are now trying to hide their relationship from me, though I cannot be sure. Two days ago, I told my roommate that I no longer think it is healthy for me to live with her. She was fine with this and is asking around for places to stay. I will also consider leaving if she cannot leave. The most crushing thing about all this is that the two of them were people I considered best friends. This is also happening LESS THAN 2 weeks after the break up. It feels weird and rude to me. Of course they are within their rights to do whatever, but I feel like I was betrayed, even before the relationship ended. Maybe in time I'll be happy for them.  TLDR; Ex and roommate hanging out still, I suspect something is going on and now they're hiding it from me.  Edit: you all are so kind! Thanks for the words of encouragement, tough love, and shared experiences. I am staying with a friend tonight and am hoping that the move-out situation goes smoothly. Living apart from my current roommate is the only viable option for me, moving forward. I will also be cutting contact from both of them as soon as the living situation is settled.  I am going to therapy tomorrow, and went last week, so I’m hoping that helps. I am so thankful I have off from work. It’s been nice to just be able to rest. Edit 2: roommate confirmed in a convo today that they are “more than friends.”","Damn, that's pretty fucked. Can pretty much guarantee one of them will fuck-up again once the honeymoon phase ends and they meet someone mildly interesting.",1518
ev6ls7,[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/eszfhr/my_32f_boyfriend_32m_doesnt_see_my_long_commute/) I took your advice and told him we needed to work this out now - no more kicking the can down the road with “I’ll think about it”s. I told him this on Friday and said to take the weekend and think things over and that we could talk about it when I got home - either together on Sunday (when I got back from visiting family) or in couples counseling on Monday.  He opted to talk about it on Monday in therapy and made it seem like everything was fine in the meantime and then in therapy dropped the bomb on me that he thinks we should live in separate apartments but not break up.  So essentially - I live close to my work and he lives close to his. Note that he doesn’t have a car and the closest train station is a 30-40 minute drive away from where I’d be. He doesn’t compromise in any way and I’m supposed to believe this isn’t a prelude to a breakup.  I already feel like such a fool for having done this for almost 2 years because I thought we were building towards something together.  Thank you to everyone that commented on my previous post urging me to tackle this sooner rather than later. This monumentally sucks and I’ve been crying for hours (did I mention that my cat is going in for tests today to see if she has cancer? And this is the timing he chose to pull the rug out from under our relationship?) but at least now I know I guess.  TLDR: I have a 2-3 hour daily commute which I’ve been doing for close to 2 years while boyfriend walks to work. Tensions have been rising due to distribution of chores and free time. I asked if we could move somewhere halfway between our respective workplaces when the lease is up in May and boyfriend opted instead to tell me to move out to my own apartment if I want to continue in this relationship. EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone that has responded to this update post. My original post got a handful of comments and this update post blew up and I’ve been so touched by the kindness I’ve seen here. Even for those that said less than kind things - thank you too. I posted not for an echo chamber but to get all opinions and I appreciate the dissenting views as well. You have all given me a lot to think about and I’ll do my best to respond to everyone but please be patient with me as it may take me some time.  Again thank you :),What a selfish coward.,2332
evr8cj,"I had a very awkward moment on the phone with my parents yesterday. I really like family history (not 24&me but like tracing the family tree), so I’ve been doing some research. My dad asked about it and when he mentioned some previous research his first cousin ""Karen"" had done. &#x200B; >Me: “well yeah but that might not be our side of the family, right? She’s technically only your half your cousin right?""   >   >My Dad: ""What do you mean, no she's not, Karen is my Aunt Betsy's daughter so she's my cousin.”   >   >Me: ""Well Grandma and Aunt Betsy are half sisters, right? So you’re only like 25% related.” To back up for a second, my grandma is in her 80s and does’t have dementia or anything.  She definitely didn’t just ""get confused"" and say something inaccurate, but it’s very possible she forgot that she hadn’t told her own son and therefore should tell him before she told his daughter. When my grandma told me, it was in a casual context with my parents present (but evidently not listening to our conversation). She said she’d known/suspected since she was young that her younger sister Betsy was a product of an affair. She didn't really frame it as a huge secret, more just a family tidbit that she and Betsy had long since set aside. &#x200B; >My Dad: Wait, what do you mean 25%?   >   >Me:  “Well, Grandma and Betsy don’t have the same father so technically-""   >   >My mom: “WHAT? Great-Grandma Name had an affair?!?!?” I stumblingly apologized and my dad sort of acted like this was something he knew about his mom/grandma, but I could tell from his recovery that he did not know, and was a little rattled by both the revelation and the fact that it had come from his daughter of all people. It doesn’t immediately affect his personal self-image - his parents/grandparents are still the same people, we don’t really see that cousin and her family anymore, and obviously all of the adults involved are long dead, but still. **TL;DR: I told my dad that his own grandmother had an affair and his cousin was his half-cousin. Should I do something? Should I say something to someone? Warn my grandma? Apologize to someone? Or just keep my mouth shut?**","You've done nothing wrong. Your grandmother told you within earshot of your parents and never said it was a secret. However, you might want to check in with your dad. Something like, ""When we talked about Aunt Betsy, I had no idea you didn't know. I'm sorry if it came as a surprise. Grandma mentioned it to me when we visited, so she could probably tell you all about it. I love you and I hope you're ok."" Not acknowledging what happened may be more uncomfortable for you and your dad, and also gives far too much importance to this decades-old secret.",2888

In our house, with a new kitchen to work with, Louis decided to pursue cooking for himself as a hobby, and expanded his tastes. He still eats mostly meat, but has moved on to things like bacon-wrapped meatballs and burgers. The fried chicken was more occasional, and he improved his cooking style over the year. Shortly after I made the original post, we talked to Louis about the jokes he'd been making concerning the incident. He genuinely didn't know he had offended people and apologized to everyone he thought necessary. Things were mended on that front pretty quickly. We have since left that job and that housing, and so has he. But Louis proved to be one of the best roommates we ever had. He was reliable, fun to be around, and hard working. We consider him one of our close friends now, and are very grateful to have had the experience of living together. Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post, your advice was sound and you all helped me feel much better about the situation, which ended up turning out great.

We're broken up, I'm trying to organize a trip to see some friends next weekend. I'm not really sure what to do before then, I haven't eaten much or slept much. I've never been this alone before. I had someone to talk to for the last 7 years. Some friends reached out to me, which was nice. And I didnt cry at work.

Though my post didn't get much attention, I wanted to give an update to the people who've helped :) I talked to my friend about it. I explained all the things I've thought about, and my sexuality, and my feelings for him. I was shaking and sweating and close to tears, but he got it. He hugged me, and ordered us a pizza. We were in complete awkward silence while waiting for it. He put on my favorite movie (Eternal Sunshine btw) and we just ate on the couch.  Halfway through it, he held my hand and did a cheesy, silly speech about how he thought that I was ace because I never got on with anyone, and he didn't either because he wanted me, but never made a move too <:) I cried again, and then he cried, and after we calmed down, we just cuddled. My hands were oily and I stained his shirt, but that's something to remember the day I guess.  It's been a while now, and we're officially boyfriends! We went on a date at a bakery and he finally asked, though we've been living as a couple anyways after so many years together.  It's weird to do these things with a man, and especially my best friend, but we're taking it slow, making things continue as they've always been. He's so so sweet and I'm so happy to be with him.

f7ikcz,"I got kicked out by my parents a few years ago because of my choice of career. I'm a cinematographer. When I tell people that I got kicked out because of my occupation, they always think I went into something drastic like porn or something. But nope. I'm a filmmaker. Some context - my parents are African immigrants (Nigerian dad, Kenyan mom). I have three older siblings. The oldest is a doctor, second oldest a lawyer and third oldest an engineer. I was supposed also to into engineering (structural). I studied it in college. My parents were dead set on me becoming an engineer like my sister. A lot of African immigrants who come to the West want their kids to have jobs like those my older siblings have. When I graduated, I told them I was going to try my hand at filmmaking. When I was in college, I dated a chick who was going to film school. She was an editor and she introduced me to filmmaking. I fell in love with it and began learning as much about it as I could. That summer I worked my ass off and bought myself some equipment and just started shooting. Everything and anything. It's amazing how much you can improve at something when you do it over and over again. Even shooting things as mundane as flowers made me a better cinematographer. I began gaining ability with the camera and during college in my free time, I started shooting stuff like music vids for local artists, corporate videos, short documentaries. By the time I graduated I felt confident I could make a living in this trade.  I was so scared to tell my parents of my decision. My dad had been talking to his friend (also an engineer) and they got me an internship at his firm. Around the same time I was offered to shoot a feature length documentary in a few countries in South Asia for six months. I chose the latter. It didn't go down well with the rents. We had a big argument and they kicked me out. They told me I was wasting my time with filmmaking and that it would leave me penniless and on the streets. At my sister's wedding (a year later) they refused to talk to me. Acted like I didn't exist. That was the last time I saw them. When I got kicked out I had just graduated from school. I didn't have much. My brother (the lawyer) took me in and I stayed with him for 16 months while I worked in order for me to get my own place. I'll never forget what he did for me. My other two siblings also thought I was wasting my time with filmmaking and but he was the only one who was so supportive and had my back throughout everything. Things are good now. I'm financially independent. My career is in a good place. Getting a steady flow of jobs. I'm also engaged and get married next year.  The other day I got a message from my mom, asking how I was. She also apologized for everything that went down. She wants us to meet next weekend. She said my dad is too proud of a man to say that he wants me back in his life, but that is certainly the case. **tl;dr** I haven't decided on the course of action I'm going to take. I'm inclined towards meeting her. I do miss my parents. Even though I am still hurt and angry towards what happened. And smug too, I'll admit. They thought I would fail. Almost prayed for it to happen. It didn't. How do you guys think I should approach this thing? How do I approach the meeting with my mom? I've been thinking about it over and over again. I'm nervous. --- **tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question","Why not meet with her and see what she has to say? Take things slowly, expect some growing pains. Since your parents kicked you out, you really get to dictate what level of involvement you're ready for them to have in your life.",2770

He took me around the city, we tried all kinds of food, had honestly the most fun I've had since I was a kid, made memories off of little moments, I didn't think that much of it. I realized that the whole day had basically been an all day-date, I knew it had to be coming and I had the ring with me and I was going to try and propose at the same time (someone suggested this in my original post and I thought it would be cute)  He opened my door, walked me down a beautiful pathway and just looked me in the eyes and I said yes. He laughed and dropped down to one knee and I started crying and forgot that I was supposed to be proposing too. I don't even remember what he said, he was on his knee for a while saying what I'm sure were the sweetest things, but I was too busy crying. I'd already said yes before he even got down on one knee so he put the ring on my finger. We went home and and I realized I didn't propose, he wanted to shower and we sometimes shower together so I proposed to him in there. He smiled and said “I wonder if when our first kid is born will it top this moment” then because I was on my knees in the shower he had to make a sex joke  After we got out he held me while we called his parents (I'd already called my whole family in car ride home)  Yesterday was amazing and now I'm laying next to him while he plays video games and he's talking about our engagement to his friends and I couldn't be happier and I don't know how to contain all this and just ugh! I love you Nathan!❤️ Edit: Thank you to everyone congratulating us! I appreciate it very much  TL;DR: He took me on a romantic all day date and popped the question. I was supposed to propose at the same time but was too busy crying form happiness, I proposed to him in the shower when we got home I'm overjoyed right now!",This is so disgustingly wholesome and it's melting my cold heart :') Congrats!!,1836

It really is this worried feeling that I can never quite shake. I can respect that she has been victimized in some ways and have compassion for her, but I also think that the bystanders to relationships like this are subject to a large emotional toll. I worry about whether I will get a phone call that she is dead or in jail for harming him, and also miss my sister. It sucks. It's not about me, but it affects me. &#x200B; He got arrested for assault about a year ago. She said she was going to leave and I let her move into my house as a place to recuperate and get back on her feet. She lived there for about a year, didn't pay rent for a long time and then after a while, a negligible amount to help with bills. I got to see up close and personal that she has significant issues with alcohol, as well as mental health issues that she hasn't chosen to address. I sometimes think she has un-diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder. &#x200B; A few months ago, I went upstairs to her room to get something and he was up there, just chilling in her bed like he lived there. She lied and said it was the first time, but it turns out he had a whole drawer of clothes, and that she had been sneaking him in there for months. I asked her to move out within 30 days, as I no longer felt safe with him there. She now lives in an apartment, I presume with him, and I barely hear from her. It also turns out that she paid for his lawyer, and was likely using the \~1000 a month she was saving by living with me to fund this. &#x200B; This is how it's going to be. I think I'm done with trying to ""save"" her. We had a somewhat traumatic childhood and I think I'm bonded to her in an unhealthy way sometimes, trying to fix something that I have no control over. I don't really reach out to her much, aside from the occasional text telling her I am thinking of her. I am polite when I see her but I have a LOT of anger and disgust towards her that I'm trying to deal with. My hope is that one day she will leave for good and find her way back to family and friends that love her. For now she is quite isolated, although still working and paying bills. I don't know what she thinks is going to happen, neither me nor my parents want anything to do with him. I fear that she will have a child with him. &#x200B; Anyways, it's been my experience that if you are trying to help a person in an abusive relationship, don't sacrifice your own happiness or stress yourself out too much with it. And try not to take it personally when they don't leave, even though it feels like the most personal thing in the world. I read it takes an average of 7 times of trying to leave before someone escapes. If that's true, she has another 3-4 times of leaving before she is done. And I can't change or control a thing about it, which is what I'm working on for myself. &#x200B; tl;dr My sister left abusive boyfriend after assault and moved into my house to re-establish herself, heal, and save money. She then eventually decided to see him again secretly, sneaking him into my house. I had to ask her to leave. She remains with him. I've learned to set better boundaries and not over-extend myself to help someone in an unhealthy relationship, because they have to leave when they are ready to leave.","I can see this is really hard for you, but you are taking some good steps. You still communicate with her (or are open to it), and she knows where you stand regarding her bf. It's great that you're thinking about matching what you can control and what you are concerned about. It's really stressful to worry about something you can't control, because there's no way to lessen it. Best of luck moving forwards, and I hope your sister can address her deeper issues and leave this relationship eventually.",1091

I asked him if he would be willing to go to therapy with me, and he refused. He told me when we first starting dating that he would never go to therapy, and I assumed he'd change his mind at some point because he would care enough about me and our relationship to work through the hard things in counseling. We see this all the time on this sub, but really, when people tell you who they are, believe them. Refusing to go to therapy really left me with the two choices of staying and having nothing change and being unhappy... or leaving. I opted to leave even though it was scary and so, so hard. The initial heartbreak is starting to fade, and I'm working on rediscovering myself. I know that I did the right thing for myself, but it was also the hard thing. I kept this throwaway account around, and I'm posting this update because I wanted to thank this community and the individuals who offered their input. I know I didn't comment on anything in my original post, but it was very helpful to have some outside opinions. I appreciate you all so much. Thank you for your advice and assistance when I was faced with a difficult situation. TLDR: I ended things because he refused to go to therapy with me to work on our issues.","You did the right thing.  He wasn’t going to change and staying would have most certainly left you miserable.  I’m happy to hear you’re doing better and hope you find someone that respects you enough to work with you.  My husband was a slob when we met... LIKE A HUGE SLOB!! When we moved in together, I let him know that I would not live in a pig sty and expected help.  It took some work, and I had to lower my expectations a little bit but he is way better.  I’d say if I lowered mine 2 points, he raised his 8 points.  We celebrated 28 years recently because he cared about something that I cared about, a common thread in our marriage.",1097
fmc7q4,"I\[22F\] am an understanding and supportive girlfriend, at least I strive to be that person. I have been with my boyfriend through his drug addiction, his university failures, him changing into a new university, etc. For the past month, my boyfriend, Nick, has been hanging out with my best friend, Emily. They text, they share memes and she knows about him as much as I do, if not more. I am not an overly jealous person but it did make me uncomfortable when I realized that they had been spending hours together, just the two of them. Obviously I confronted them about it and both of them reassured me that it was nothing. During this time he also started bringing up things like, ""he needs his freedom and his independence and focus on his career,"" despite knowing I have been very supportive of his decision to change degrees and have been with him throughout the process and would not come in between him and his career. Recently my boyfriend told me that he felt very stressed in school and needed time to focus on it and wasn't sure if he could put enough effort into our relationship and I told him we could take a break, while he figured out what he wanted. Despite the break (where we agreed to not date other people) we still hung out and there wasn’t any bad blood. But yesterday at my best friend's birthday party while I was inside, a friend of mine comes to tell me that Emily has her legs on Nick's lap and he's been massaging her upper thighs and whatnot. Obviously, I tried to be calm, but I did go out and see what was happening. I saw them sitting very close to one another, with his hand far up her thighs and the moment he saw me, he pulled back like he'd been burned. It was so awkward for me as we’d just been out together a day before and Nick gave me the vibes that our break was really temporary. I confronted them after the party and my boyfriend kept bringing the whole ""freedom"" and ""independence"" thing and I broke up with him for real there because it was a little too much to deal with. I told my best friend, she has hurt me immensely and I left. My bf still stayed at her place after but apparently, nothing happened in between them. Anyway, the next day Emily calls me and she apologized to me, telling me she didn't realize it was such a huge thing and they were just being playful. She then proceeded to tell me that Nick told her he has fallen for her, she again reassured me that I mattered to her most and that she wasn't going to be in contact with Nick anymore because she doesn't like him and I know that is true because he is not her type. But I know that she loves attention, no matter if she's into the guy or not. I don't completely trust her because she did lead him on, knowing how that would make me feel. She kept on promising me that she won't talk to him anymore that she loves me, but honestly, their behaviour have really broken my trust on them.  As for my boyfriend, I haven't been texting him because he knowingly hurt me, was dishonest to me, despite all the things I've done for him. He still insisted that his school is really affecting him and is the priority, but it's difficult to trust him after his actions. I blame him more as he was definitely aware of what was happening. I feel heavily exhausted and drained because of this and I would really appreciate some advice to help get me back up on my feet as I did not realize how bad this would hurt. I managed to keep my self-respect and calm in front of them, but it really hurt me from within.  \[TL;DR: Boyfriend tells my best friend that he's fallen for her, and I need to know if I should trust either one of them anymore.\] Edit: to everyone who’s telling he’s not my boyfriend and I shouldn’t refer to him, I know and I agree. I also wrote this post like a day after all the incidents happened and I was so used to referring him that way that it came out on it’s own. Update: thank you to everyone for their responses, since posting this, I’ve realised that they are still very immature and need to grow into their own. Some experiences in my childhood and initial adult years definitely helped me with my calmness and understanding in this situation. For now, I would break contact and let them become their own individuals and its good if they learn and grow from this. Thank you for everyone who commented, once I actually realised that it wasn’t me, my whole outlook changed and I do believe that all these comments really helped with understanding that, so thank you.","So your boyfriend wanted to break up but instead of just coming out and saying it, he gave you a whole bunch of crap about freedom and independence and then immediately went and hit up your best friend, making you be the one to actually instigate the breakup.  Forget him. That relationship is over. As for your friend, how much did she know about the ‘break’ you were on? Did she think he was single? It’s still poor behaviour, but it’s up to you if you want to talk to her and see if the friendship can be salvaged.",4203
fn8n1t,"I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months. I felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did. Well, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D What happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing! And so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance. Things started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me. At a low point, I said to my husband: ""You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring."" It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me. Over the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self. One night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most. I got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now. Do you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha! Our sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot! Even though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3 Thank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement. TLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex. Update: OMG thank you thank you thank you for all the comments and awards! I have no words! I thought maybe 5 people would care about the update, not this amazing amount of encouragement! Thank you so much, so glad to have been on this journey with you. <3","This is the best post I have ever read on here. You changed your thoughts about yourself, which is the secret to life (IMO). Congrats and thank you for this empowering and amazing story!",1709
fnrw1q,"I used to be a very shy and socially awkward kid and never had many friends growing up. However in my teenage years I had a 'glowup' and developed more and more social skills and nowadays I have no social anxiety anymore and find it generally easy to meet and talk to new people. I feel like I am generally liked and I don't feel excluded. However, there is a thing I've noticed which is that friendships don't seem to stick around a lot of the time. By that I mean, people that I've met and then don't see them that often anymore for some reason, don't seem interested in staying in contact. For example old coworkers. In my first job people hung out in private a lot and we all got along awesomely. However after I left, noone tried to stay in contact with me. I tried to keep it up somewhat but it fizzled out eventually. I know however that some people from that job are still friends to this day and meet, whereas I have not seen or heard from anyone from there in years.  And that is just one example, but that seems to be how it goes usually. I have one friend who has been around for 7 years which is great, but apart from that, I have a hard time finding people who really want to stick around, if you know what I mean? It's like when I'm part of a friend group I seem liked and don't feel like they value me less than the others, but then when someone would have to make an effort to keep me in their lives they just don't. And I compare it to what I see from other people. For example I was pretty tight with a few people in high school, so about 8 years ago. I know that they or at least some of them are still close friends, while I have not heard anything from any of them since.. well 8 years. Any advice? Am I just unlucky or is it something about me? ___  **tl,dr:** It seems like even people who like me don't try hard to stay in my life, and I don't have many lasting friendships. Anything I can do about that?","Honestly sounds pretty normal based on your one example. For instance, I’m very friendly and outgoing at work and have a lot of work friends. Occasionally we’ll hang out together outside of work, but generally these people are all work friends, not friend-friends. I’ve been working professionally for five years now and I’ve only become true friends with one person from work. Around coworkers, no matter how close you are at work, there’s [generally] always a layer of professionalism that’s there preventing me from truly being my realest self the way I am around my actual friends. Remember friendships are a two way street. You have to put in effort to maintain that relationship, but just as much, that person has to as well. But not everyone is willing to do that, especially as we get older. Keep being yourself and hopefully you’ll find more real, genuine friends.",2015

Thanks for all the comments.    After the post, I talked to her. Telling her that something felt shady about the whole cheating accident, I asked her for details, that I needed her to be honest.    Just a reminder, before this, she told me it was not a big deal, just some sexual texts. Turns out, it was that, plus nudes, plus bonding, plus other sexual stuff. It was at the point she thought about leaving me for him.    I was dumbfounded. She admited that despite telling me she stopped talking to him, she didn't. That, in her point of view, he saved her life, as he was the only person in the world she felt comfortable enough talking in details about her suicidal thoughts, and that ""sex was just to thank him, he deserved it"".     She refused to stop talking to him. I told her that, in this case, we'd break up. She told me to grow up, we broke up. She went CRAZY and sent me images of her hurting herself, saying she's kill herself and asking her friends to tell me she'll kill herself.    After some time, she calmed down and apologized. I told her that at first I wanted to break up to heal, trust her again and maybe build a new romantic relationship, but that it was impossible after the crap she did.     I'll focus on myself rn, but I'm still feeling dependant, and I still... love her. We agreed on a friends with benefits kinda relationship if everything was cool between us at the end of the quarantine (which could end at the end of the month, or in a month, depending on the situation.)    I know you told me it was a bad idea, but heh, I need time to change everything. I'll handle it. My therapist also told me not to make rash decisions like cutting her off completly, but to focus on myself. I'll do that.    Thanks again! Edit.: So guys. You realise I said that we would consider a FwB relationship if everything seemed fine after the quarantine. That nothing is set in stone. I... Thank you for your support. I'm thinking a lot rn. Also, my therapist didn't tell me ""don't cut her off"", she told me ""don't make rash decisions, as you have the tendency to live through other people. Make your own choices"", because I've told her about asking for advice on reddit. Thanks again for all the comments. I'm reading them all! OH and PLEASE remember, we're two women. tl;dr: my (20F) GF (22F) cheated on me, and guilt trip me about it. We broke up. She went crazy.","I would not bother with FWB with this person.

I broke up with my boyfriend a couple of days after this post. I didn't plan on it happening so soon, but we got into another petty fight and it escalated to the point where I told him this wasn't working.  The petty fight was because I refused to sleep on the side of the bed away from the phone charger. In my own apartment. One time I accidentally snoozed his alarm for work and he was late. I hadn't done it again since then but he held it over my head. I'm not sure what shifted the argument but it started to be about how he works harder than me and that I don't deserve my job because it's easier than his. It then turns back to all the grudges he's held against me, as it usually does.  After fighting for almost 4 hours, I tell him that we need to take a break. He changes his demeanor completely and then tries to tell me that he's sorry and he doesn't want to lose me. He makes promises to curb his anger issues by taking medication and going to therapy, which I've asked of him time and time again to do in the past. I wonder at this point, why does it take me breaking up with him for him to finally want to do these things? The next day I told him that he needed to pack his things from my apartment. I left for work and he did what I asked. A couple days later I went to get my keys. He started crying and telling me that this feels like a real break up. I told him it just might be, I didn't know if I wanted to get back together with him. I still feel regretful for saying it was a break, because I gave him hope that we would possibly reconcile when I didn't intend on it. I was afraid that if I had suggested a break up right off the bat I would have gotten a more explosive reaction from him. We hugged after I got my keys and I was hoping that maybe there was a chance we could remain friends. About two weeks after this he showed up at my apartment unannounced. I got scared and called my mom, and she hurried over. As soon as he saw her he told her that he just wanted his things. I should have seen this was a red flag because the only thing of his that remained was a hairdryer. As soon as I let them in he rushed over to my box of condoms and counted them, before saying there was one missing and running over to dig through my trashcans. He couldn't find anything and then tried to take the snake he got me for our anniversary. I stopped him from taking the snake, at this point I was sobbing and freaking out. My mom and I were yelling at him to leave or else we would call the police. After he left, I blocked him on all social media and his phone number.  Since then I've had a mixed range of emotions, from missing him to hating him. I realize that he was abusive but I can't help but feel guilty about how things ended. I don't regret that I made the decision to break up with him, however, because a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I really want to thank everyone that replied to my post because you all gave me the courage to stand up for myself and initiate the end of this relationship that was slowly destroying me. I feel so free now that I have control of my life without someone micromanaging me, and I still struggle with thoughts of him but I'm slowly but surely improving.  Tl;dr: I broke up with my boyfriend, had some shit happen, but I'm much happier! Edit: to clear some confusion, this happened 4 months ago, almost 5. I haven't had any contact with him since I blocked him, and I dont have any worries about it since he probably hates my guts. Thank you all for the nice comments!",You were right to call your mother.

fwlbw9,"GF (28) wants full blown marriage and commitment from me (24) after only a year and a half. I’ve been seeing my gf since last November and I like her a lot. But she keeps escalating the relationship way faster than I feel comfortable. It started when I took out a lease on a bigger apartment last June and she just decided to move in with me, without even really asking. It’s been fine and I enjoy having her around. But then she took out a mortgage on a condo this October. I told her I thought things were moving too fast and she said, “Don’t worry, this has nothing to do with you.” I tried to tell her I didn’t want to move there because it’s way further from my job and I would need to buy a car to commute. She got upset and said I wasn’t committed enough to her. The condo won’t be finished until December and I told her I’d think about it (which I have). But now it’s turned into her expecting me to help pay the mortgage, furnish the place out of my pocket, and go half and half on a car with her, none of which I agreed to. She also said she expects kids within 2 years, and that she’ll go to a sperm bank if I don’t want to do it.  I just tell her, “I’ll think about it,” to keep the peace.  She keeps making these huge life decisions and just expecting me to go along with her. Should I just break up with her? It would break my heart. I really do love her and the life we have together now, as is. But I don’t want a mortgage, or kids.  I’ve never written any of this down before. The more I write the more insane I realize this is starting to sound. I’ve just never initiated a breakup before. It terrifies me and I have no idea how to go about it. I keep ruminating about it constantly. It’s driving me crazy. I need help. TL;DR  GF is strong arming me into buying an apartment and having a kid with her way before I’m ready. I think I need to break up with her but I’m scared to.","I think the most telling part of this is where she continues to tell you that if you don’t want one aspect of this, she’ll accomplish it another way. She isn’t treating you like a partner, she’s treating you like filler. You’re filling a spot in her life. She will fill the others by any means necessary. You cannot possibly want this for yourself, to just be a wheel on the vehicle that conveys her to her ideal future at the sacrifice of your own.",5415

He tried to stop me from leaving, and we had an in depth talk about the problems we have been having. He admitted to not treating me right, saying I deserve much better. Damn right I do. He tells me he will try to be better and that he will make more of an effort to show me he cares. Given that, as many of you pointed out, this is not just about the cake but a growing resentment about his lack of effort and thought for me, I couldn't forgive him as easily as I usually have. After that, he proceeds to cook me dinner and insists on buying something sweet for me. I'm not gonna lie, it gave me a glimmer of hope that finally, he understands and that maybe this could work out. I knew this might just be a honeymoon period and told him so. This morning, I was on my laptop and he comes over to give me a kiss (yay improvement, right?). Feeling positive, I was scrolling through yoga videos on youtube (on incognito because I was using my non-work email as a log in). He tells me that I changed my screen. I say no. He says, yes I did. And I read through the comments of my last post once again and realized, this will never change. When he insisted, me going for a good night kiss was me checking his screen. When he insisted I was upset over him buying his sister cake. When he insisted I do or feel things that I do not. It is all the same. And he will never understand how exhausting and emotionally draining and toxic that is. He has not only managed to make me feel neglected and lonely, but has taken away my right to my truth or my feelings. I read Lundy Bancroft and damn, water torturer. My nape cooled when I read accounts of women who have been documenting their experiences and saw it align with my iPhone notes starting from August 2019 detailing our interactions just so I would not have to question myself.  I walked away quietly, without even saying goodbye to our dear cat because my weak a-- might not have been able to leave if I think about never hearing her purr at me again. I have blocked him, all my belongings are in my car, and I am with my cousin looking for a more permanent place to stay. I left my keys, and hopefully all that pain, in that apartment. I am not naive, and though right now I feel free and brave as a mofo, I know there will be many nights ahead where I will drench my pillow with tears. But for now, I will have my cheese bread, and eat it too. TL;DR: He will never understand me and I left. Thank you everyone for your comments and support! Having had questioned myself a lot lately, it has been incredibly helpful to hear outside perspectives. Thank you again and wish me luck!",Proud of you! My ex used to do that same thing when things were getting bad between us. The big gestures like making dinner or buying me things like it’s gonna fix it all. I don’t want big gestures. I want the little things and consistency. The big gestures honestly made me feel manipulated. Even if it wasn’t his intention it felt like he was saying “how could you leave after all this effort and money I just spent on you?” I’m glad you saw through it and left. And I’m so sorry about the cat. I still miss my ex’s dog three years later. Hope we both find someone who treats us how we deserve to be treated!,4317
g0qm1u,"I've never had a relationship with my dad. He left when i was born and signed away all parental rights to me when he was 18 and my mom was 19. When I was 16 I went behind my moms back and got information on him, and found my aunt on facebook. I messaged her without telling my mom. Well, I didn't think it through because she told my mom that i reached out and asked for permission to talk to me.  When my mom found out she cried and was so upset i didn't come to her. I felt like i couldn't because of how emotional it makes her. But she gave her permission, and we talked everyday and she also gave me her sisters facebook, who she said was ecstatic to meet me.  Then, one day, they stopped. On the same day. I was so confused. Its been years now but i was so hurt and confused. I was so excited to finally know the other half of me, and it just stopped. It hurt a lot, but I let it go.  Well, this morning my mom used my laptop and left her facebook logged in. As this has been on my mind consistently over the years, i just had to look at their conversation. When i found it, i was shocked.  She told my aunt that she didn't want them contacting me anymore and asked that they would stop, and they respected it. I was just so shocked and hurt. I couldn't believe it, she never told me she did that. I had just spent years thinking they didn't care enough.  I got so mad at my mom, I packed a few of my things and left. Shes been texting and calling me like crazy, shes mad at me now and I don't know what to do or if i overreacted. She told me it hurt her badly for me to talk to her like that ten leave. How do I fix this, or can I? Its been about 7 hours now, and i'm at my boyfriends, but I don't have anywhere else to turn.  Tl;Dr My mom told my biological family to stop contacting me and never told me. I found out today and i left the house. Edit: my mom lied by omission.

My mom gave him a way out 19 years ago, and he took it. Also, my moms not a narcissist. Highly emotional? Yes. She can also unintentionally gaslight situations, which is why I left.

As you have somewhere to stay, just text your mum that you need some space from her for a while. Also, reach out to your aunts, as they might have been just as hurt as you were.",2570
g21ik6,"TLDR: My parents have been trying to get me to move on really fast, get me to do all my classwork as if nothing happened, are pretty homophobic, and have been calling my late fiancée terrible things and I do not know how to cope. So, I woke up to my fiancée being dead on Wednesday, April 1st 2020. She died unexpectedly and I don't want to go into the details of her death with strangers yet but it has been the largest, most traumatic event of my life. On the first day, I called her parents (50s M/F) who came and picked me up to stay with them for a week because my parents lived across the country and I just couldn't handle being alone in our apartment anymore. Me and her family, which are very kind and accepting people, grieved together and comforted each other. They were extremely sweet and kind people and I was very lucky to get to stay with them when it first happened.  However, my parents were also informed of my fiancée's death and made the long, multiple day drive across the country to come. They packed up my apartment for me because I just couldn't go back there (which was very kind of them) and picked me up the night after her funeral to take me to my childhood home. The first thing my mom did was complain about her own problems and how disrespectful/inconsiderate I was to not thank her right away or something. I don't really remember exactly what it was about but I didn't have the energy to argue or put up with her so I just mumbled some answers and tried to remain quiet. Then, later in the night as we were trying to go to sleep, my mom decided to start asking why my fiancée didn't care for her that much and I explained it was because she is homophobic. My mom then went into a huge screaming tirade about how she didn't want her daughter to be a lesbian (I remember her actual quote being ""Well, I'm sorry that I don't want my daughter to become a lesbian!"") and how us holding hands when she visited us last year was extremely disrespectful. (When she visited us last yet, she made my fiancée break down and cry so hard I had to drive my fiancée somewhere to be without my mom for an extended period of time.) I just cried quietly to myself until she stopped screaming and we went to sleep. Around the first few days after my fiancée's death, I would wake up crying and in a panic. Her parents would just hug me and we would cry and talk until I was able to calm down, but my mom that morning reacted by screaming at me. She was saying things like ""Stop crying!"" and ""I hate [fiancée] now!"" and ""If she was alive, I'd kill her because you just keep crying!"" and just similar stuff. It made everything worse and I just wanted to throw up for the beginning of our long drive home. She also kept taunting me by saying she was going to put me in a mental health hospital or whatever it's called. On the drive home, she kept bringing up negative topics any chance she got. During all these she called my fiancée a slut and a whore. She said that my fiancée ""looked like someone who would sleep around."" and just tried to disgrace her character. She then tried to convince me that my fiancée was toxic and controlling (she wasn't) and that she must've been abusive because she was driving a wedge between me and my family. It hurt me to even think that fiancée was abusive when she did nothing but care about me and was tender and loving to me. When I was talking about how smart and beautiful my fiancée was, she kept saying I was smarter and prettier than my fiancée which just made me feel incredibly crappy. Sometimes, she would then have these strange mood swings where she would say ""If I could, I would kill myself so [fiancée] could be alive. That's what you really want, don't you?"" and when she would ask that, she would demand and answer and I just didn't know how to answer and I would end up crying harder. She also kept trying to say she knows what I'm going through and I have to toughen up but she married the first person she ever dated, so she never even went through a breakup before. She would also continuously joke (?) about how she was going to buy me a blow up doll and dress her in my fiancée's clothes and it just made me feel so sick and uncomfortable and terrible when she would make that joke. She still makes that joke and now has my dad in on it. When we got home, I thought I was going to stay with my grandparents (70s M/F) but my mom informed me that I would have to stay with her or my sister (20 F) because I might have the Coronavirus and she wouldn't want me to give it to my grandparents, who currently have my emotional support cat at their house because my parents and sister both have dogs. My childhood best friend (20 F) also came over to stay with me for a couple weeks (which is a blessing) but she only feels comfortable staying with my parents because my sister doesn't take good care of her house. So, I'm currently at my parents house. Anyway, the day I got home, I went to my sister's house for a little bit to get away from my parents but my dad just ended up calling me on my phone and screaming at me that I only have a week (starting from Friday) to cry and get over it, then I would have to work and not be seen moping around or upset about it again. He also continued to call my fiancée a selfish bitch and told me that I needed to forget about her and get on with my life. This made me just break down. I called my ""mother in law"" (for lack of better term) and just cried to her about everything and I think she really doesn't like my parents now. But, she told me that they are just trying to make me feel better by treating this like a breakup. My fiancée's family is extremely religious (but accepting) and so they believe that like people need to be with their blood families to heal, so I think they're just having a difficult time understanding how my parents could be so mean but they're starting to understand every time I talk to them about it. However, they're on the other side of the country and there is nothing they can do about it now anyway other than listen when I call them. My parents don't want me to call them because they say that her family needs to grieve and I'm bothering them so now I'm really worried I'm just bothering her parents. I also made it clear to my parents that I'm changing my last name to hers because that was our plan when we got married and it was important to me still and at first, when I told them on the phone a few days after she passed, they seemed okay with it but now that I'm here, they're throwing a huge dramatic show about it. They keep screaming about it and telling me that I can't change my name to a slut's name and that nobody would love me if I changed my name to hers and I'm just so worried that maybe they're right but I feel like it's necessary. My parents' dog also has been growling at me every day because I'm new to him (they got him while I was gone and living with my fiancée) and my dad today yelled at me to stop ""moping around"" so the dog will stop growling at me because he thinks the dog growls at me due to my coldness or something. I don't know. I ended up breaking down in the shower because it's the only place I can be alone anymore (my room doesn't have a door) and I desperately miss my fiancée and the life we made together.  I'm ashamed that I'm 22 and am living with my parents right now and I'm just depressed and anxious and scared. None of my coping mechanisms I have learned from my depression and anxiety therapist have worked and I don't know what to do anymore.  What can I do to make my parents more empathetic and caring? I've always been somebody who just needs to be held and told sweet things to when bad stuff happens to make me feel okay again but they're just making everything worse. When I talk to them they just shrug it off. One time, I asked my mom if she could be nicer to me and she said ""I am being nicer than usual."" I don't know what to do anymore. I just need to know what to tell them so they stop all this and become kind and sweet and consoling. I just need it and her family knew I needed it but they, for some reason, don't understand. I've been hugged and cuddled more by my once to-be in-laws than by my own parents after all this happened. Please tell me what to do to get them to understand and treat me better. Or just tell me what I should do. I don't know anymore. I'm struggling. Thank you for reading, sorry for the long post. Please leave your suggestions of what I should do below. I can't keep the tears in much longer.","There is nothing you can do to change them. You need to cut them off. Do anything you possibly can to get out of this living situation. Move in with your sister, ask if your fiance's family will take you in, stay with a friend, etc.  I am so sorry for your loss.",4603
g2gm2h,"I don't have the happiest home life, my dad and mom got into a lot of fights because he was cheating on her. I don't know why they're still together honestly He and she fight a lot, and when that happens, I just kind of mentally shut down. Like let my eyes unfocus, stop paying attention to my hearing or other senses. Just relax into my own mind. It honestly feels like an out of body experience a little, I feel untethered from my own body, like I'm floating through empty space. It takes a while to come back too; like I feel kind of like I'm deep deep underwater and anything that someone says or does is blurred and delayed so much by the time it gets to me. I know that sounds super weird but honestly it's the thing that's keeping me sane through this shit. But I think it's been making my dad and mom really mad, when either of them is angry with me and I go to that place, they get furious, they yell at me for being a ""fucking vegetable"" and accuse me of being messed up in the head. Tried to shake me out of it once. Been telling their friends that I'm autistic. I don't think I am. I know it makes them mad but it's honestly the nicest thing I can do for myself, I'm so sick of their shit. If I can't go somewhere physically, I guess the next best thing is to leave there mentally. TLDR my parents get mad at me for going to that other mental place when there's anger at home, but I don't want to stop doing it","Hey, OP, I used to do the same thing with my parents, and later with several boyfriends. It's definitely called ""dissociation"" and it's a normal thing that your brain does to protect itself during traumatic events. It doesn't mean you're autistic, different, or broken in any way; it just means that your parents are awful, shitty people. I'm so sorry. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do at all about this. You've probably said to yourself something like, ""next time I'll do *xyz thing* instead of freezing up and zoning out,"" right? After getting screamed at, I always tried to think of something else I could do or say the next time, but almost always ended up disassociating again instead. And the truth is that your parents, in that moment, are already targeting you with abuse, so they may pick apart or scream at you for *anything* you'd do in those situations. At least retreating into your head is predictable for everyone involved, and easy to do, so that's why your brain does it. It's okay. At 17, you could try to become emancipated, but it may take longer than just waiting for your 18th birthday, depending on how far away that is, and honestly it's a pretty difficult legal battle. Your best bet is to try to just hold onto your sanity however you best can until you're 18, and then leave as soon as you can. If there's a friend's family who would take you in, I'd recommend reaching out to them. Finish school however you can, do well in your studies, and apply for as many scholarships and grants as you can if you want to go to college after high school. If you can't or don't want to go to college, that's okay too; you'll find a job, and there are resources out there in your state to help you get on your feet (medicaid, food stamps, section 8 housing, Planned Parenthood can help get you on birth control, etc) if your income is low. When you leave, bring all of your important documents: photo ID or driver's license, passport if you have one, birth certificate, and social security card. You'll need your ID and soc card (or birth certificate) for onboarding at any new job, and the others are *yours* and will help you replace anything you might lose. Keep them in a safe place that nobody else can get to, and that can't be lost or stolen (don't keep them all in your wallet or car!). If you have a bank account and your parents are listed on it, you should make a new account at a completely separate banking institution once you turn 18, and don't tell them about it if you think they'll try to access your money. Move your money from the old account to the new account without telling them. I've been where you are. I'm 32 now. It gets better. Your situation will get better too. Just remember that this isn't forever, and that you'll be able to get out of there at some point. And please reach out to someone you trust for support in the meantime! If I can help at all or if you want to talk, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm here and not going anywhere. Edit: Thank you so much for the silver (edit2: and other awards, omg what?!)! I really appreciate it, but my main focus is on OP. Does anyone know of any trauma resources she might be able to access for free online, or other ways to help her without alerting her parents?",4208

I texted BF, telling him essentially that I needed a bit of space to take a breather and reevaluate. I made it clear that I didn’t want to break up, but felt like I was always being monitored and I wanted to make a game plan to have healthy communication through this pandemic.  He called me super upset and accused me of choosing SB over him. I told him that it wasn’t about SB, it’s not like I chose SB, he’s literally just someone I get along with who I can hang out with during the pandemic. I explained to him that it was not like I was spending every waking moment with him, I do my homework in the morning, we hang out in the afternoon, and my evening time is divided between the 4 of us (mom, stepdad, SB) and FaceTiming BF.  BF then accused me of doing special, “boyfriend” activities with SB. He told me that it was always his dream to teach me to drive (he doesn’t even have his permit. Am I supposed to wait around for him to get it?). Also apparently me teaching SB how to bake bread? Which is stupid because I was going to make the bread to begin with, and SB “helped” by moving the heavy mixer, eating half the almond slices, and taking pictures for Instagram.  He also screamed at me for not moving in, saying how all this would have been prevented if we were living together. I told him that I have no interest in living somewhere that I’m not allowed to be. I can’t afford a fine from bylaw, and if I were to get kicked out, it would be more difficult to find my way home since I don’t drive.  In the end, I told BF that I would not give up my relationship with SB, who is part of my family and a genuinely nice guy, to ease my BFs insecurities and cater to his demands. I told BF that I needed time to cool down, and that I’d talk to him in a few days. That was all on Friday, and today I reached out to see how he was. He was still pissed at me and accusatory, so I basically told him that this wasn’t working and I want to break up. I did it over text and then blocked him, which probably makes me an asshole, but I literally couldn’t deal with anymore of him yelling at me and insulting my family.  Anyway thanks to everyone who commented. I’m really sad this is the outcome and I’ve been crying a lot, but I’m also kind of relieved.  TLDR: we broke up because he couldn’t see how controlling he was being.",Omg this is AWESOME. Good for you girl. It’s such a burden dealing with someone who is jealous and insecure. It’s refreshing when you don’t deal with them anymore,2406
g5ibwx,"I’m 23, the only son in my family, and I have 3 older sisters(27, 29, 30). They are all very opinionated, on everything. Right now they’re main focus is me and my girlfriend, of 4 months. They barrage me all day with texts and phone calls about how this woman isn’t right for me, flaws they see in her, advising me to break up, on and on. It’s weird, whenever any of them dated a guy, I never said anything, but, whenever I date, oh my god, stop the presses. In the past, as it relates to their “ advice”, I’ve tried an “ I can handle myself, thanks though” approach, they don’t listen. I’ve tried, “ stfu and go away”, they get offended and but continue advising. They hate this woman(23F) I’m with now. Personally, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in a relationship. She’s more outgoing and talkative than women I’ve dated in the past, very pretty, very bubbly, very fun. They think she’s shallow, unintelligent, and image-obsessed, and I rebuke these claims all the time with them. I just want them to stop with the snide remarks and insults. When I try and stop it, whether it’s in a text thread or call or video chat or whatever, someone’s quick to remind me of the “pecking order” and told that “they have my best interests in mind” and want to see me with the “ right girl” aka one they approve of. &#x200B; TLDR: How can I get my older sisters to accept who I'm dating?","Short answer is that you won’t be able to get your sisters to accept who you are dating. Your sisters are not reasonable rational people and you cannot interact with them like they will respond to you kindly.  They have told you they are on top of the pecking order and you are the bottom and must obey.  They have essentially told you that they “love” you so much they must abuse you. The only way to deal with people like this is boundaries and consequences.  You have told your sisters to stop commenting on your relationship with girlfriend.  Now you need to enact consequences when they do not comply.  Stop responding to your sisters when they start commenting on your relationship.  Do not respond at all to any negative comments other than “l will not discuss this with you.  If you continue I will not have contact with you for 2 weeks.”  Every time they bring up girlfriend you cut contact, after the first time and they still do not stop abusing you then you increase the time out to 4 weeks.  Then double it again if needed. Same for any video call or in person visit.  The moment they start with comments you tell them to stop.  If they do not you leave and put them in a time out. I am sorry your sisters try to control your life.  They don’t actually care for you, they just want to control you.  If they actually thought you were in a bad relationship they would have never brought up the “pecking order”.  They gave themselves away by saying that to you.",2966
g7x81m,"Okay, the title does seem a little one sided.  Context: My boyfriend (29m) and I (30f) have been dating since last summer. I live alone in an apartment in downtown DC and he lives alone in a house in Annapolis about 40 mins away. Pre-quarantine, we did well will splitting weekends between the two places. Once states closed for COVID, we decided it made most sense for me to temporarily move in/stay with him in the bigger space with a yard for the dogs.  As you might imagine, it’s had its ups and downs. We were getting a crash course in living together in a space that wasn’t really mine at all, having lots of important conversations, enjoying evenings cooking together and having wine while watching shows together.  We’ve also been irritable due to drastic changes in our daily routines. I have continued to work full time from home (+ overtime due to an even busier schedule) while he is only working a half day once a week. He is bored. I am stressed with work and finding it difficult to decompress. I am used to/need quiet time to myself to recharge and he likes a noisy household (TVs always on, music on top of that, chattering constantly about sports or draft statistics or things only of interest to him). I’ve tried saying “I’m going upstairs to read” or “I’d just like some quiet time to myself” and it bugs him that I don’t want to do things that he wants. I find myself becoming more snappy and short-tempered from feeling constantly drained, which isn’t fair to him.  Last night he wanted to watch the NFL draft so I made plans to FaceTime my girlfriends upstairs while he did that. I am used to weekly girls nights and miss them as they’re also my primary support network. I heard him downstairs complaining to his dog that I never want to hang out with him. After FaceTiming I went down and sat on the sofa with him and said “hey I heard you talking to the dog, I came to hang out, how are *your team’s* picks doing?”. He was irritable and replied “ugh it was quiet until you came down”. I’m feeling like I can’t win.  Alright; getting to the point now. I hadn’t been to my apartment in over 3 weeks and needed to go check on it (it’s not in a building, it’s in a row house) and pick up prescriptions I couldn’t have transferred. We were originally going to go together but seeing this irritation with each other I suggested I’d just go alone and take a night or so to myself to recharge and come back.  COVID NOTE: I do not have to interact with anyone to access my apartment. My car already had ample gas. I literally drive from his house to my street, am alone in my apartment. Any exposure to no-contact takeout I would have gotten is the same as if I were there with him.  This morning, when I grabbed some necessities for a night to myself (my laptop because I have to work over the weekend, some underwear, face moisturizer) he got upset and said I might as well take all my stuff and not bother coming back. I tried to talk through why it was so all-or-nothing for him. He said I clearly didn’t want to spend time with him or be around him so I can just go home for good and we can resume dating when the states open back up. He actually bagged up the remainder of my stuff and took it out to my car for me.  Reddit, I just wanted to read in silence, get my medications (anxiety pills), water my plants, sleep in my own bed alone for a night, watch my own trashy TV shows without interruption. And now I think my relationship is over? I’m feeling frustrated that I attempted to handle this in a productive and proactive way and somehow screwed up.  TLDR; boyfriend said if I wanted a night alone I should just take all my stuff from his house and continue to stay alone through the rest of quarantine (no added exposure risk). I’m confused with his all-or-nothing approach.  So, what do I do from here? EDIT: wow, this post blew up. THANK YOU for such thoughtful and thought-provoking commentary. I’ve felt really supported and “seen” by a lot of these replies.  I’m still reading through and responding to comments but wanted to provide a quick update re: some things I keep seeing pop up.  I am home in my own apartment, alone. He has not contacted me. I spent yesterday drinking wine, cooking, listening to music softly, FaceTiming girlfriends, caring for my plants, and reading a good book. (And checking reddit of course). I am not crying or sad. I feel comfortable and at ease in my space again.  While bf is not working, he is still being paid his full salary.  While I am currently working a lot, I normally have a much healthier work-life balance. Some big deadlines happened to coincide with and be exacerbated by the pandemic. it’s only temporary (a few weeks of hellish hustle). I was very clear with my boyfriend before this upswing started, and let him know I was going to be a lot busier and would appreciate his support extra for a couple of weeks until things settled down again.  Many of you have brought up quality time. I have attempted to express my desire for quality time to him. Things as blunt as “let’s hang out together tonight, what should we do?” Or “We’ve been sort of coexisting, let’s plan to do something together more like quality time.” Perhaps I wasn’t resonating with his communication style. Sometimes it would work and we’d have a nice dinner and watch a show together etc. and other times it would end in frustration and not go anywhere.  In regards to the mattress thing, I am hearing all your replies about how it just wasn’t important to him so he didn’t want to compromise. It took my having a very dramatic hysterical emotional breakdown after nights of no sleep for him to realize how important it was we find a solution. That breakdown was loud and ugly on my part and not a moment I am proud of. It came after numerous “I’m really not sleeping well, I need more sleep than you do, can we work something out so I’m more comfortable” conversations.  I am in therapy and understand I am a highly flawed human with dramatic emotional tendencies as well. I do not always communicate well. I consider myself very self-aware and make concerted efforts to require my default actions to create a better life for myself and my loved ones.  And, finally, you are all not wrong that I have a low bar for thoughtfulness. It’s not really something I’ve ever experienced in a relationship.","Sounds like spending time apart is not the worst idea, go home and decompress and let him reach out.",3701
g8zo4o,"I just wanted to make and update to this post that I made from about a month ago for anybody interested :) [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ft1whw/my\_21f\_boyfriend\_24m\_doesnt\_want\_me\_posting/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ft1whw/my_21f_boyfriend_24m_doesnt_want_me_posting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)  I took in everybody's comments and my own feelings into consideration and sat my partner down for a serious talk after our fight. (im sorry i didn't practice proper social distancing. i drove to his apartment to have this talk because i felt that it would be better to have this discussion face to face rather than thru text or call as our fight was thru that medium) I also reiterated why this was important to me and brought up all the points you guys made and really made him listen and consider.  And surprisingly, he took it really well! There were some tears here and there but in the end he understood my point and he apologized for not being completely considerate of me and my choices. He said he wanted our relationship to work and he was sorry for hurting me through his actions and he'll try to be better in the long run. He also said he didn't want to be that person that takes away my freedom and my choices just because we're in a relationship. (I sobbed really hard at this one lol) So overall that turned out pretty nice and since then we've been smooth sailing. We also decided to quarantine together as time apart raised some tension between us and neither of us wanted to catch anything or infect anyone and not adhere to proper social distancing by still travelling back and forth to each other's places.  Just wanna say thanks you guys <3 tldr; boyfriend understood my pov and the points that you guys brought up, apologized and promised to be better! now we're both stuck at home and happy :)","I’m not trying to be a Negative Nancy, but keep an eye out for behavior changes.

Guess which couple hasn't been having sex during the quarentine? Us. After reading everyone's advice, I convinced my husband to go get a testosterone test.  It came back normal.  We are in the same postion, only it is so much worse, so much lonlier, and I am in counseling so I can start feeling ready to leave.  1. I got some toys to have better sex. Now that's all he wants to do is use those on me.  It honestly is just like him helping me masturbate, which I do just fine.  2. He wants me to just tell him when I am ready, like - hey, I want to have sex. And then he uses the toys on me. It feels sort of degrading to me, like - if you have an itch, tell me and I'll scratch it.    3.  He never went to see a specialist.  I have asked many times, what if it is because of something simple, maybe a specialist could find out? But no, he said it isn't worth the money.  And that feels like he is saying I am not worth the $30 copay.  4.  I am sad that I stayed married.  I feel sexually lonely. I never feel attractive or beautiful.   5. We love each other, and in that way have a happy relationship.But it is like a long distance relationship in the same house.  -- UPDATE: I have shared much of this discussion with him, thank you.   As for the part about me not feeling beautiful, hew said we are both getting older. That conversation made me feel sadder than I already feel. As for the question of attraction in general, he said there are women he finds attractive, but not to the point of having a crush or flirting. As for going to a doctor and looking into other options, he laughed and said, ""my body, my choice."" -- **tl;dr**: Still no sex, still sad, but now considering leaving. I wish my 20 year old self would have had the confidence to admit sex mattered and to run away from a partner who didn't want to learn why he had ED.","Maybe I’m reaching, but if he’s had ED for 20+ years, meds are no longer helping, and he refuses to see a specialist there’s something much deeper going on. Has he given up? Low self-esteem?   If you’re unable to revise your idea of sex and he doesn’t want to change, divorce might be best.",1414

I took some advice I received on this post and decided we needed to take action. I couldn't stand having this guy be around anymore, receiving praise from his coworkers while none of them know what was truly happening. I talked with a few of my coworkers about it and we started looking into our options. Our company offers a hotline to report incidents just like this, completely anonymously. Finally, after a little bit of debate, one of us called the hotline and reported the incidents. We waited to see what would happen. Eventually the security team reached back out to him and asked him for more information. They said they are building a case and they need as much information as possible. After hearing this, the rest of the us decided to report our cases to further aid in the building of the case. I remember the security officer telling me that things are going to ""move quickly."" Well I guess in a big company they don't fuck around with this. Less than a month after the initial report was filed the creepy asshole was fired. The entire department was told to meet in a meeting room real quick for some news and management laid it on us that he was gone. He was a highly respected coworker who was really good at his job. The news was met with shock, especially since some layoffs had occurred recently. I remember my heart absolutely racing when the news was being given. I couldn't believe that it was happening. I really didn't think some anonymous reports would lead to action so quickly. The creepy guy was friends with some of the women in our department, and he was texting them constantly saying that he was innocent. He quit pretty quickly once they weren't having any of what he was saying. The rumors of why he was fired spread really quickly around the office, but fizzled out faster than I was expecting. I really thought this would be going around the office for months, but after two weeks or so people stopped talking about it and things returned to normal. I really appreciate the advice on here. It was extremely helpful in my decision, and it worked out for the best. TLDR: If you want to take pictures of your coworkers in the bathroom and you like your job, then maybe reconsider. Coworker fired for this very thing after being reported.","Good call, I cringed when I read the other comments saying to try to find a way to check his phone.

gklndb," UPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/l5jc7c/update_my_29m_soon_to_be_exhusband_seems_to_feel/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf  My husband and I have been together almost 8 years, married for 2 and half of those .Last May (2019) we seperated seemingly overnight. He left me and our toddler and moved back to his hometown. There was never a solid reason given, just that he felt we should have never gotten married. In July, he changed his tune and wanted to be a family again. He was still at his job in his hometown, so I decided I would ride it out at my job in a different city for a couple of months to build my resume and then start looking for other jobs in his hometown. After 6 months of a brutal commute, taking care of our child during the week by myself and driving to his hometown EVERY weekend, interviewing, basically bending over backwards, I finally landed a great job in December. A week before I was to move into the new house we were buying together and start my new job, I found out he had been having an affair. He begged and pleaded for me to stay with him, said he’d break off all contact, and I foolishly agreed to give him another chance. Two days later while I was back in the different city and completing my last week of work at my old job, he unblocked her on everything and liked her pictures on Instagram. I was devastated. On top of that shit show, he kicked me out of the house we were supposed to move in together and I had to find a new place to live TWO days before starting my new position. We have lived seperately ever since. He has said and done so many hateful things in this time period, and said so many times that he wants a divorce that I’ve lost count. Up until a month ago he was still maintaining contact with her. I saw her car at his house, took pictures for the lawyers, etc. and he admitted he had been talking with her still. I stopped doing the “pick me dance” about a month ago and stopped reaching out to him besides contact about our child. Now he has suddenly changed his tune and is “desperate” to get me back and will do anything. He has unfollowed her on everything. Unliked all her pictures. Tells me not to give up on our family. I’ve moved on... I am not interested in pursuing another relationship with him. He’s hurt me deeply and I feel like I’ve been fucked over by him so many times that I’ve lost count. How can I tell him there isn’t a chance without sounding like a completely heartless person? I still want to be able to maintain a strong coparenting relationship with him, so I am friendly to him, but he seems to take that as I want him back. I have relayed to him my feelings, but they fall on deaf ears. He says he will never stop trying to get our family back together and does not want a divorce. I do. Does anyone have advice?   TL;DR: husband cheated and left me, was adamant he wanted a divorce, now when I want one too he changes his tune.  Edited to add, just to show the kind of person he is: When I asked him about the reason for his sudden change of heart, he said it was because I “seemed stronger”. Ahhh, the irony. Honestly, a big thank you to the prick for yanking the rug under my feet not once, but twice, because I truly have realized how much better I can do and how I don’t need anyone but myself to have a happy life. 2nd Edit: Seriously, thank you to everyone who has read my story and commented. You have no idea how much it’s helping me to focus on myself and realize I need stop considering the feelings of someone who had no consideration of mine. I only hope that anyone who is in a similar situation realizes that you CAN and you DO move on. And I promise that you will feel like a 10,000 pound weight has been lifted off your back. 3rd Edit: He is being served papers in the next 1-2 weeks. Guarantee the “I’ve Changed” mask slips off. I hope I’m wrong...but I’ve learned all too well that my gut feelings are usually spot on. Hopefully I’ll be back with an update in a few months with the good news that the split is official!","“My ex feels entitled to a relationship with me.” Filed under “How awesome for him.” See, also “‘No’ is a complete answer.,”  You’re concerned about appearing like a heartless person to someone who not only acted heartlessly to you, but abandoned your child.

grrrnt,"My husband (23M) and I (22F) have been married for 2 years. Recently I found out he was paying for onlyfans through his bank account (we have a joint account and I check our account often because I like to track our expenses)  When I confronted him about it he told me his friend had asked him if he could use his card because he couldn’t use his own personal one, I never in a million years thought my husband would pay for such thing so I stupidly believed him.  Fast forward a month later and I see the same payments, once again I confront him and yet again he said it’s his friend’s account so I told him to text his friend and ask him to send him the money that was charged, turns out he was lying about letting his friend use his card.  I end up finding the entire truth (by myself because I couldn’t believe anything he said) turns out he had been paying for girl’s nudes and not only that he personally knows 2 of those girls and I know 1 of the 2. He spent $50 paying difference girls for subscriptions.  TL;DR He has had an onlyfans account since around June 2019 and he had also told me he didn’t know any of the girls which wasn’t true. EDIT: I would like to add that I myself am not huge on watching porn, I probably haven’t watched much or at all since we got married I just didn’t feel the need to so I don’t know much about how it works. Some of you were nice enough to educate me that it’s better for him to pay than to watch free stolen content and I would like to say I 100% agree. I hadn’t seen it that way but I get what you guys mean and I’m sorry if I offended anyone. Not for this relationship because he obviously is a liar but maybe for the next I will be willing to sit down and talk to whomever I’m with about porn expenses. I am still not okay with the lying and paying for people he personally knows which is why I will not be going back to him. Again thank you for the clarification!","You're young, get a divorce and you'll find someone who has their eyes on you one day, it's up to you since i am just a stranger but this isn't gonna change and this is the first and only thing i could think of to fix this, good luck!",1369
gxpuj2,"Sorry if this is poorly written I have never used Reddit before, I was discussing the situation with my son \[not one of those who lives with me\] and he suggested making this post. I have always been an introverted man, my ideal night is a quiet one in-front of the tv with my wife. I loved raising my 3 kids and was sad to see them go when they left but was also happy that they was living their own lives and I could enjoy the piece and quiet that I hadn't had for a long time. All of my children are married now, my eldest (32M) is living a successful life with his wife and children. But my daughter quickly lost her job and couldn't find a new one and relied on her husband's (31M) wages but had 3 children (6F, 5M, 3F) despite it not really being financially viable. They fell behind on rent and couldn't support themselves so they all moved in with my wife and I. Then my other son and his wife (26F) had 2 children (4M, 1F) and they made a lot of financially bad decisions including buying an expensive car from a unreliable person. It turns out the car was stolen and it was taken by the authorities and my son lost a lot of money on it. They too couldn't keep up with bills and looking after their children so moved in with us. My wife welcomed them with open arms. My wife enjoys the quiet life like me but she is also more of an extrovert and she loves having the kids and grand-kids around. But this is a nightmare, I thought my days of being a parent and running after kids was over but it feels like I am doing it now more than ever. I shouldn't have too put up with this at my age I have done my job as a parent and I shouldn't have to do it again. I get no peace at all I can't read a book for 5 mins without being interrupted by a screaming child. It's horrible having 11 people crammed into one house, granted it's a big house but still. Even going to toilet is such a pain because I always have to wait for multiple of my family members to go first. What's really annoying is that everyone else seems very happy with this arrangement. I know they are all looking for jobs but I don't particularly see them putting in maximum effort to find somewhere else to stay. I am really reaching the end of my tether and when i tried to talk to my wife about it she was appalled with me saying that you don't stop being a parent once your kids move out and I should help them in their time of need. I sort of feel like she is right but at the same time I just can't stand this anymore. What do I do? TL;DR- My grown up kids, their partners and their children have all moved in with me and my wife. Ruining my ideal quiet life",This is such a tough situation. I’m sure everyone is trying to make the most of it. Try to sit the kids down and work through two plans. 1) you need breaks from the chaos. This means that your kids need to take the grandkids out of the house for long stretches a few days a week. Lots of things are still closed from coronavirus but they can go on hikes and picnics. 2) they need a long term commitment on finding work and moving out. This is stickier because the job market is so weird right now. But they need a plan. They need to work out budgets to figure out the minimum amount they need to make to afford an apartment and move out. Then apply for every single job in that salary range. You can do this. It’s tough times for everyone and it’s good to watch out for your family but you definitely need some relief.,3365
gy5ard,"I've got a mate who I'll call ""John"" has an amazing body. He's a gym junkie and loves his workout. Really nice bloke that I've been mates with for a couple years.  Yesterday we met up with John and his girlfriend, ""Kayla"" (27F). Kayla runs and owns a very successful cafe that is now taking some customers because of lifted restrictions. John was there on his day off helping out. My girlfriend and I decided to go see John and Kayla  to catch up. We were sitting talking in the courtyard to each other. John and I started to talk about the bicep tear he had and I asked how recovery was going. He showed me he can now flex slightly with it. My girlfriend asked if she could touch his bicep. He said no because it was still healing and it hurts.  Later on she literally walked up behind him and felt his pecs as I was talking to him. He recoiled and took her hands off. He asked her to please not touch him there. He explained he really only lets Kayla touch him there. And then she just ignored what he said and slapped his abbs. That's when I told her to maybe lay off it. I turned to see Kayla looking at us from the counter. She looked really angry.  Kayla later came up to my girlfriend and just asked her not to grab John. It wasn't so much an ask but telling her to touch John. My girlfriend I talked about it on depth last night and she sees nothing wrong with what she did. She's giving me the silent treatment because I agreed with Kayla. TL;DR: Girlfriend saw nothing wrong with feeling up our friends boyfriend. She's acting like a child and giving me the silent treatment.",Your girlfriend is wrong.  There’s not even a slight whisper of a gray area here.,5101
gzblnk,"So, my fiancée has taken up cooking during quarantine. Previously, we did not cook much and instead ate out a lot. We could afford it and are generally healthy eaters. Of course, we both CAN cook but given how busy we are it was easier to eat out. Also to be honest, I don't really enjoy cooking and see it as a chore to be avoided. I love food but there are other things I'd rather do with my time. Due to quarantine, my fiancée has decided to actually cook more and she has found she really enjoys it. This is great! I'm happy for her that she's discovered a new thing that brings her joy. Turns out she's also quite good at it and cares about learning new skills, etc., so I've been benefiting as well. I still don't really care to cook myself like I said, so in return for her putting all this effort into cooking I've been helping out by paying for take out on nights she doesn't want to cook as well as doing all the dishes and cleaning the counters, etc. for the days when she does cook. As far as I was aware she agreed that this was a suitable compromise, and of course if she felt it was unfair I would have been happy to pick up the slack in other ways. But she seemed to be happy with this. As her cooking experiments expanded to baking and generally became more elaborate, she started to rope me into cooking. I'd head to the kitchen to get a drink and check on her and she'd be like, ""oh can you help me chop this while I saute this..."" or something. I would chop some carrots for her or whatever and chat with her about the meal and then head back to whatever I was doing. I didn't mind this at all. But it has slowly grown into me becoming her sous chef, especially when she wants to make meals that are really easier with two people. Keep in mind her cooking experiments are elaborate and sometimes take two or more hours. So my entire evening is gone to these cooking endeavors and this happens multiple times a week. On top of that, she tends to order me around in the kitchen and can be a little rude.  As you can probably predict we had a fight about it. I told her that I dislike her attitude in the kitchen when I help, and I don't like cooking to begin with. I would feel better about helping her if she wasn't so rude to me. But quite frankly, I don't want to spend 8+ hours every week cooking. It is not MY hobby, it's hers. If she wanted me to pitch in by providing meals, I would buy them or make something simple.  She was very upset. She said that it wasn't fair that I was enjoying the fruits of her labor but not contributing, and that cooking took 2 hours but doing the dishes/cleaning only took half an hour. I told her that it was her decision to make very elaborate meals and that I would be happy if she put together a simple pizza or stir fry. After a certain point, the elaborateness of her meals crosses into hobby territory and I resent being made to feel like I'm a bad partner because I don't want to give up multiple evenings to HER hobby. We did not really resolve this. I actually bought/made some of my own meals on a few nights so I wasn't ""enjoying the fruits of her labor"" but this seemed to make her more upset and our fridge started to fill with more leftovers than she could eat herself. Another time I ended up helping her but told her I needed to go to a videochat at 8 pm, and she got upset when I actually stopped helping to leave even though I'd told her beforehand. I told her a little snappishly, I'm afraid, that I wasn't her sous chef to boss around in the kitchen. I tried to discuss this with her again when we were feeling calmer. I told her that I loved that she found a new hobby but it is HER hobby and I can't help with it and don't want to feel obligated to do so. She retorted that it wasn't feminist of me to relegate the cooking to her and benefit from it without helping. The feminism connection makes little sense to me because previously neither of us cooked much and she chose to take up cooking herself, but of course I didn't tell her that. I told her that if she wants to discuss the distribution of labor in our house we can do so and come up with something new that reflects that she's cooking more now.  We tried to do this but she wanted to count ALL the time she spends cooking as ""chore time."" So according to her ideal chore distribution, she spends 10+ hours cooking DINNER ONLY every week, which somehow leaves me with pretty much all the rest of the chores. I told her I wasn't happy with this, because making elaborate meals is a hobby. It isn't fair that say, 6/10 hours of her ""chores"" is actually her hobby, and I have to do an equivalent amount of actual chores, if that makes sense. So we're at a bit of an impasse. Am I actually being a bad feminist? I don't think I am wrong (I am quite familiar with emotional labor, mental load, all that) but maybe I am. I love this woman and obviously want to marry her but we're usually good at making decisions logically and this is the first time we've had such a disagreement. I don't know how to get her to understand the boundary between cooking as a necessary activity and cooking as a hobby. I would appreciate your advice. **TL;DR: Fiancée has taken up cooking elaborate meals as a hobby but now it's becoming an obligation for me to help and do more chores than I think I should.**","I’ve spent a long time in food service and am good friends with chefs. This has taught me that one of the biggest components of getting food made quickly is prep...something that is literally a full time job.  If this is really her passion project, she should do more prep. That means having things chopped, marinated and sauces and such prepared as much ahead of time as you can. Cooking is an ORDEAL when you don’t prep properly and are doing everything on the fly.  One or two days a week devoted to prep would make your lives a lot easier.",2565
h0dhsh,"Update in regards to: my original post that ""[I asked my bf for alone time and he told me to pack my stuff and leave for good](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/g7x81m/i_asked_my_bf_for_alone_time_and_he_told_me_to/).""  Well, as a likely shock to no one, we (me, 30F and him, 29M) broke up. It wasn't as swift as some comments encouraged... we reconciled after he insisted he hadn’t meant to end things and had overreacted out of emotion. We gave it another shot living in our own places again for a few weeks. Things went well enough, but unresolved trust issues became exacerbated as I was not in his physical proximity as often and he felt insecure about the distance between us.  Ultimately, a few weeks after reconciling we ended up in another argument after dinner one night. There was once again a very disproportionate reaction to a situation that should have been more calmly communicated about, and I realized if we reconciled again I'd be in the same position a few weeks later... it had become an exhausting cycle. We aren't in contact this time. He found the original thread I posted and was (understandably) hurt by what I wrote and for not sticking up for him. I am sad, mourning ending the relationship, and feeling bad for hurting someone I care about.

Edit to add context/clarity to the first paragraph.","The thing that stood out in the original post is that he complained when you were upstairs, then complained when you came down to hang out.  There is no winning with people like that. No matter what you do they will find fault and keep you in a perpetual state of contrition to them.

And you can never make things right because expectations shift and often contradict previous demands.  Trust you made the right decision.",2218
h0x2ck,"Throwaway cause my son follows account and is actually the one who set it up. Background: I met my wife when I was studying overseas when I was 27. She was 25 at that time with a 2 year old daughter. She was, and to this day is, a damn good artist and a middle school art teacher. Her brother was my first friend overseas and still is one of my best friends and I met my wife when he invited me for Christmas dinner with his family. I have no idea what she saw in a broke college student in his late 20s but I thank my lucky stars she gave me a chance. Two years later we were married and a year after that, at 30, we had our son... Our second child. I adopted her daughter shortly after we were married and I love her to death. She's always been a daddy's girl and no matter what anyone says, she's mine. Despite the fact that she's very white and I'm as Asian as they come haha.  I eventually graduated and landed a job as a financial analyst in a pretty big company. I busted my ass off at work and when I wasn't at work I was busy trading in the stock market. After a couple of years, good investments, and a lot of loans, I took a leap of faith and quit my job to start my own company.  When my daughter was 14 and my son was 9, I started making seven figures a year from what I earned from the company and my several investments. I slowed down after that and cut my hours a bit, so I'd be more involved in my children's lives.  Since my daughter was young, she's always shown interest in business. She'd spend her Saturdays with me in my company and wanted to learn all about it. I offered to take my son too but he wasn't interested and wanted to be an artist like his mother.  Now I just want to clarify that I was very involved in both my children's lives. I make it a point to talk to both of them over dinner almost every night. One of my son's first portrait, which was of me and my wife, still hangs in my office at work.  Because of this, I've always groomed my daughter to be my successor. She's the one who always took interest in running my company one day and even studied in a prestigious business school. My son studied art in Italy.  Now, I know every parent says this but my daughter is a genius when it comes to business. She works (or at least worked) in a big international company based in Europe before coming home last year to work with me in mine, where she has plans to scale it to even greater heights (it's still not a very big company). And this is where the problem starts.  My wife and I are about to retire (early, I know) to travel the world. She's never been into luxury items, unlike me, but she does love to travel.  So we sat our children down and announced that we were retiring early and that they'd be getting some of their inheritance soon (I wanted to sort out my estate very early to avoid problems for them when I'm gone).  The moment I said ""daughter will be taking my place in the company"" my son was livid. He started accusing me of favoritism, being a useless dad, and his sister of manipulating me into giving it to her and leaving him with nothing. My wife tried to calm him down but he stormed out, but not before yelling ""she's not even your real daughter anyway!"".  I didn't know how to feel after that. It was a mix of pain, anger, regret, and a whole lot of other stuff. I was hurt by some of the things he said, angry about how he said his sister wasn't my daughter, and regret cause somehow I feel like I've failed him as a father. I wasn't even finished explaining how things would go.  I hugged my daughter, who was crying, and reassured her that I loved her so much while my wife tried to get a hold of our son.  I tried to be a good father to him. I paid for his international education, attended all his art events, and even introduced him to some of my friends that were into art. I made sure to take him on father-son trips too every couple of months. It never occurred to me that he was ever remotely jealous of his sister being my apprentice, despite the fact that I did try to take him with us when we went to work.  Also, I never planned on giving one child more than the other. My daughter was only taking over running the company, but the ownership would've been 55/45, so my son would still own part of the company. I own 3 condos in the city, 2 of which are occupied by my children (which they would keep) and the 3rd would've went to my son to make up for giving his sister more equity in the company. He would've also kept my watch collection, which I promised to him at a young age. Both kids would've got a substantial amount of money too. My current home would still be mine to rent out, and I'm keeping my stocks, so Id still have some money coming in to fund our travels.  Now I don't know how to go on from here. I'm set to retire after this pandemic is sorted and its safe to travel. It's been a week and my son still won't answer his mother's call. I'm still mad about how he acted but I still want him to be part of our lives. My daughter even offered to give him everything if it would make him happy but I shut that down immediately. I worked hard for BOTH my children.  How do I proceed? Part of me wants to call but I know we'd just get into another screaming match cause the things he said still hurt me. That's if he even answers my call. I don't think I did anything wrong here, but if I did, please tell me so I can fix it. My wife is beside me right now and she's still trying to reach our son but no luck.  Any advice would be helpful TL/DR: I told my kids my daughter would take my place in my business. Son was livid before hearing the whole story. He said a few hurtful things and now we're both mad at each other. Edit: I don't think this part was clear. My son never heard how I was going to split my assets and ownership of the company. He only heard the part where I said my daughter was taking my place before he went ballistic. Edit 2: My son doesn't fully rely on my money. He lives in my condo and I paid for his car but he makes his own money and his work sells. He's very passionate about art and is very good at it.","Personally, I don’t think you did anything wrong. It sounds like you were very thoughtful in your succession plan and it sounds very fair. If anything, it sounds somewhat skewed towards your son as your daughter would be putting all the work into the business and he would simply profit from her work. I think your son is behaving quite spoiled. In your shoes, I would just send him a note to let him know that you weren’t done explaining his things would be split and to let you know when he’s ready to talk about it. You actually don’t owe either of your children any inheritance. Any penny you give them is very generous and kind - but your money is yours to spend as you wish. I think he is behaving in quite the entitled way, and IMO, I don’t think you should play into it.",4424
h794s5,"[PREVIOUS POST](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gzblnk/my_30m_fianc%C3%A9e_29f_has_discovered_a_new_love_of/) My original post blew up in a way I totally wasn’t expecting. It seems a lot of people could personally relate to my post in some way so I hope it’s been helpful to others apart from myself. Thanks very much to everyone who commented; I wasn’t able to reply to everyone obviously but I did read as much as I could. There are a few things I’d like to clear up since they kept coming up: She is not doing this because she wants to spend more time together. Previously, we would spend most of our evenings together watching shows or playing video games. Now that she is spending 8+ hours cooking by herself I don’t see her as much, and she is too tired from cooking sometimes to spend time with me. So that's something that’s been bugging me about this that I hadn’t even realized. It is especially bothersome to me because I work 50+ hours a week and she still works full-time as well (though her schedule is much more flexible). So now I feel like my already meager free time AND quality time with her is being cut into, which might be one of the most important aspects of this whole issue. Her motivation is not to save money or be more healthy. We live in a big city where we are able to order lots of homemade-style ethnic food from mom-n-pop type places that isn’t overly salted or oily to appeal to the masses. It’s at least as healthy as the normal diet of a Mexican, Indian, Thai, Ethiopian, etc. person. Furthermore, we make a very comfortable income and don’t want kids. So money is not an issue. So I sat her down and talked to her, again, because we were both in a good mood. But when I brought up the topic, she started to become annoyed, simply because this is a point of contention and I guess she didn’t want to talk about it.  I told her that I’m invested in solving this problem and that if we’re unable to do so we can bring it up during couples’ counseling. We had already intended to go before the wedding purely for premarital counseling, but now I feel as if there is an actual problem we have to discuss during the session and if we can get an appointment sooner rather than later I would be open to doing so. This seemed to make it real for her. She seemed to be truly taken aback that I wanted to go to counseling over this (well, not over this specifically but that I wanted to involve a counselor at all in the cooking issue). She even became teary-eyed! I felt bad so I asked her if there was anything else bothering her, that was really at the root of this, and she said that she’s overall felt pretty depressed by the pandemic and quarantine and everything. I told her I could relate and let her cry it out a bit. When she’d gotten past that I didn’t want the conversation to lose its steam so I brought up the following things: * I love that her new hobby is making her happy and I appreciate that she’s making lots of delicious food for us to enjoy.  * These are the problems I have identified which I would like to find solutions for:     * We used to spend a lot more time together. I would like to have more easy meals so we can go back to spending quality time together on TV/video games/etc. like we used to.     * I do not mind helping a little or hanging out while she’s cooking, but the disrespect in the kitchen absolutely has to stop. In future I will be getting up and leaving if she is rude to me in the kitchen.      * The unfeminist comment was a low blow and I would like an apology. She said she understood these things and apologized for the unfeminist comment. We worked out a meal schedule where I would be responsible for providing meals 2 times a week and she would cook elaborate meals on weekends. One designated night would be for both of us to cook a simpler meal together as a couples’ activity.  I asked her if there was anything about this she wanted to bring up—about how I was behaving or how she feels—and she said no, that she really was just depressed by quarantine and had dived into her new hobby. Hopefully if there is something else she will bring it up later. That was a night where she was to cook a simpler meal for us. As a show of good faith I decided to help her out and see if she could be more chill and suggested we do all the prep first as some had suggested. It started off fine but she started to become snappish as she juggled frying in two different pans and wanted me to keep handing her prepped ingredients, so I went back to my room.  I felt VERY bad because I was leaving her in a bit of a tough spot but I also felt like I needed to stand by what I said because I did not want to put up with her poor treatment of me. On top of that I had had a really difficult day at work (my job involves working with people who have very tough lives and I end up heartbroken and emotionally drained quite frequently; this has become exacerbated due to the pandemic) so I really just did not want to deal with my own partner being mean to me. Ultimately the dinner turned out fine but she was pretty icy to me. I praised the meal a bit more than I usually do but she was sour all night.  I have started looking to get a couples’ counseling appointment soon. I wish I had a happier update for you but hopefully things will get better with our new meal schedule as we continue to implement it and as I continue to set boundaries. I will also be keeping an eye on her depression and suggest individual therapy if it seems appropriate. --- **tl;dr**: We're going to couples' counseling and have implemented a new meal schedule.","I read and commented on your previous post, but now it's showing deleted.  I'm glad you left the room. If you hadn't, you'd be telling her that you don't mean what you say. It's concerning that she immediately went back to snapping after your conversation though.  You will have to keep working at this and holding her accountable if you want to help solve it, but ultimately only she can fix it. Hopefully you get a good counselor, and she puts in the work.",2424

hbckl2,"This is an update to [this post I made in January last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8uknz2/i_21m_have_been_looking_for_my_sister_18f_since/). Not many people saw it but I figured I'd update anyway because I got some good advice and, I don't know, the outcome might be something good to read while having a poo or whatever. Fair warning, this is a lot longer than I expected it to be.  **tl;dr (for the original)**: Sister has been involuntarily no contact with me since my parent's divorce. She lives with my narcissistic mother who would do anything to make sure I never see her again. I've found a way to contact her and I want to do it, but I don't want to step in her life and fuck it up for her. What's the best way to proceed? --- **Update:** Well, I'm 23 now. Finished university, starting a real job, Dad and I no longer have depression, life is pretty good. As for my sister, a few interesting things happened to say the least. Firstly - I took the overall consensus from the original post and didn't make any attempt to contact her. I did drunkenly check her the page from time to time to see if anything had changed, and I found that I'd be unblocked on my main facebook account. Probably around August that same year, my sister rang my aunt and said she wanted to arrange a meeting with her and her son (our cousin, obviously). My aunt immediately rang my Dad and I and told us the good news, we were both uncertain about how we should take it but overall we were pretty happy.  They all meet up and apparently my sister has also been kicked out of our mother's house for some reason or another and is staying with a friend, and she hasn't spoken to my mother for over a year (at this point in November). The story goes that my mother and her new victim managed to ostracise themselves from all their friends down there and my mother took out her aggression on my sister, so she stormed out and turned up teary-eyed at this friends house and has been living with them ever since. She asked about me and my father, if we were doing well, and if we 'hate her'. Obviously my aunt assured her that we definitely don't. My sister says that she wants to get in contact with the both of us but she wants to take it slow and she didn't know how we would react. In my view that's completely understandable\*.  That's interesting point #1.  ^\*Just ^(as a side note, my mother once smacked my sister in the face for wasting a tampon when she was 12. I obviously am not completely familiar with that uniquely female experience but I did get the joy of hearing that moment unfold - just for an idea of the type of person my mother is and what she did to us both as kids.)  **Interesting point #2** happens when my sister goes, with her new boyfriend, up to visit our Nan\*. Another cousin of ours (big family) is also present for this meeting. My cousin tells me that my sister told our Nan that it had been 'a few months' since she had last spoken to our mother, which is quite a bit different to 'over a year ago'. Whatever, maybe my Aunt misremembered the meeting. However, my cousin did say that she got a very 'off' vibe from my sister, and to paraphrase her own words heavily, 'you would think [Sister] had last seen us all last weekend - not 5 years ago. She walked in to [Nan's] house like she owned the fucking place. She didn't really say why she was getting in contact with us and not [you or her father] other than she ""wasn't ready"", and she didn't really say why she hadn't spoken to her mother either. I don't know, I wasn't happy with it at all, and we were all thinking that you two [my father and I] should be in that room, not us. But maybe [your mother] has made me too paranoid.' ^\*My ^(Nan is my maternal grandparent. I phone her as often as I can which isn't as often as I would like it to be admittedly and I know I'll kick myself for it. I digress - every time I do phone her, she always asks about my Dad and his new partner, and sends them both Birthday cards, Christmas cards, so on. To me it just speaks volumes about the type of person my Mother is when her mother is more concerned about the wellbeing of her ex-husband and his new partner. Just tryna get this point home to any doubters.) **#3** occurs when I find out that my sister asked my Nan for some money to help her out with University and not living with her Mother anymore. My Nan, being the lovely little 86 year old Welsh sweetheart that she is, gave her around £2,000. Now, I'm happy to be proven wrong here, but asking for £2,000 within a few hours of reconnecting with family that you haven't seen or made contact with for *five years* is very strange. I find out about this, because around November my Nan called me - because she had promised me an update on the situation - to tell me that for about a week after my Sister met up with them all, they had been in regular contact via phone and Facebook. Since that week - nothing. Unreturned voicemails, Facebook messages left on read, my sister had taken the money and fucked off. I spent the day reassuring my Nan that she hadn't done anything wrong, and she definitely wasn't the idiot she thought she was for giving my sister the money.  **#4** is the least interesting, but you'll be pleased to know that my ramblings end here at least. It should go without saying that since the first meeting in August with my aunt and her son, neither my Dad nor I have had any direct contact with my sister. On Boxing day, my sister *finally* calls my Nan and wishes her a merry Christmas. My Nan says thanks and hangs up. In January, on my Nan's 87th birthday, my sister calls up and wishes her a happy birthday, and also mentions that she's having some money problems. My Nan rolls her eyes and hands the phone to my Aunt who buys my Sister's sob story hook, line, and sinker, and rings me to tell me the, quote unquote, ""good news"" and that ""it's different this time, she really wants to see you"".  Around May (which is my Birthday month btw), my sisters sends a text to my Aunt to see if she has any old pictures of her. My aunt says she doesn't, but that me and my Dad might (which we do). My sister sends a text back saying that she will get in touch with us.  I know this is gonna come as a complete shock, but it's been radio silence since and in all honesty I'm fine with that. To me, it's crystal clear who my sister has grown up to be like. Toying with family members emotions, treating her own presence as a gift and using it to manipulate money out of people, inconsistent stories about her relationship with the one person she knows would be a deal-breaker if the rest of the family knew was still involved, and terrible at hiding her true intentions. Will she ask me for the photos? Probably not. Unless she gets really desperate and exhausts all other avenues for exploiting money out of people with pity stories, but even she knows that I know exactly who that money is going to. My mother knows that she's not in my Nan's will at this point.  If she does want to meet up, I will bring the photos with me. Part of me wants to bring two envelopes - half of the photos in one envelope, the other half shredded up in another, and depending on how well the meeting goes depends on which envelope she gets. I won't do that but it the thought of being that petty is very tempting.  I'm not holding my breath. She was 14 and I was 17 the last time I saw her; she's turning 21 this year and I was 23 in May. I've had my years of anger and grief and done my time with depression, I've hurt many people and many relationships along the way. I'm still learning what's normal and what isn't, but on the whole my life is split up into *before* and *after*, and for the most part my sister lives and will remain in the *before*. Somewhat because I want to maintain the memory I have of her and not taint it by knowing what she has become, somewhat because I'm not ready to go through what I overcame again. I've accepted my role in the universe as the recipient of bad karma to make up for all the good karma that randomly happens to other people. I'm okay with that; for the first time in my life, I've been the one in control. As for my attitude to her and my mother, the best word I could adequately use to describe it is ""ambivalent"". They could win the lottery and be on the news tomorrow or they could get hit by a bus - my reaction would probably be the same.   To everyone else out there with estranged parents or other family members - the one thing I learned is that estrangement is the best thing they'll ever do for you.  **tl;dr**: I didn't contact her, and it turned out to be a good thing, but not for the reasons I thought. --- Edit: Thank you all for your comments, I did my best to reply to everybody but given the response to the original post I had no idea this would get so much attention.  * To the people that shared their similar stories, I hope you're all keeping well and staying positive and making the most out of what you've been dealt in life. Hard times make strong people.  * In reference to my idea of ripping up the photos, that was always only ever half-serious. I wouldn't do something like that; it's petty, wouldn't be fair to my sister, and would only give me short term satisfaction in the form of a pathetic 1-up. I realised that before writing this post  * In reference to the 'bad karma' line, I actually think I'm a very lucky man all things considered. I'm where I want to be in life, I have a fun and happy and stable family around me, and I'm confident in the person I've become. That line is a glimpse into my personality - some people got that, some people were genuinely concerned for me which I do sincerely appreciate. The black dog never really stops chasing you, but I get a much warmer feeling from being able to laugh at a universe that is seemingly constantly shitting on you than I do from pretending that everything is okay; that's what I meant by that line.  Thanks again to everyone for taking the time to read, it felt good to get this off my chest and know that a lot of people think I'm making the right moves. A good amount of people made the fair comment that my sister is still young and still possibly under my Mother's influence. I appreciate those people taking the time to give feedback and advice, but ultimately my life had already moved on. I made peace with the fact that I may never see my sister again long before the events I've detailed out here, and when this all kicked off the closure and acceptance I had moved on from began to unravel. I'm not ready to go back into dark days off of a risk that everything might be okay. Yes, in the future we may reconnect, but for now I am focused on my own life and am content with taking some of the rare happy memories I had of my family in my childhood with me, untouched by these developments.",I’m sorry. That’s really shit,1739
hczgd8,"I [F27] moved into my flat in October of last year to take the place of a mutual friend of mine and my new flatmate [F27]. We have a generally great atmosphere in the flat, and both have similar expectations and habits and while we're not 'friends' yet (as in we wouldn't go out for brunch or be each others plus ones for parties) we are very friendly. She seems super normal and level. When the lockdown began (March), my boyfriend [M31] of two years was living with his sister, and his mother (undergoing chemo) who lived alone, needed somewhere to stay where she could be looked after, so she moved into his room and he came to stay with us. My flatmate was totally fine, and we had a proper chat about ground rules etc, but ultimately the flat is huge for two people and she has a kind of granny flat set up in hers. Either way, she gave definite approval.  Now, we three got on great, but never really spent a tonne of time together. We all work from home and spend the occasional evening playing games or whatever, but ultimately we didn't mingle much more than before. My boyfriend, however, cooks every night for the both of us, as a thank you, and so we do now eat together, and my flatmate seemed happy to be included. It was great. However, last week, my boyfriend took me aside and told me that while he was in the courtyard hanging out the washing she ""ambushed"" him from behind and gave a huge speech about how she's in love with him, and while she ""respects"" he's with me, she has deep feelings for him, and that she's available if he were single. Oh, and please don't tell OP. She didn't try to kiss him, but tried to hold his hand....  He was very anxious and flustered when he was telling me this. The flat atmosphere is VERY awkward now, but as far as she knows, he's not said a word. She's not said anything else to him, but he did mention that she had touched his arm a couple of times as she was walking past recently and it's really gotten under my skin. My BF is also confused because he hasn't spent that much time with her apart from dinner, and never alone.  I spoke to our mutual friend who was shocked, and says she's never done anything like this before, and she'd never known my housemate to have a crush on anyone either. I've not seen her acting strangely in any other ways, and it hasn't outwardly affected how she treats me. We can't move rn because: virus, money etc. How do I deal with this?  TL;DR: my flat mate has told my boyfriend she loves him while he's staying with us, and we can't leave. (note: edited for typo)","Broooo wtf. As the other comment says, have a serious & long conversation with her. Your boyfriend included. This is extremely inappropriate & it’s obviously affected everyone in the flat. Communicate how it has affected the atmosphere & let her know that she cant be touching up on your boyfriend when he’s yknow, still in a relationship. That’s wrong & disrespectful.",4060
hed8es,"My fiancé (30M) proposed to me (28F) literally a week before quarantine hit. We traveled to the west coast to see his family and he proposed to me there. My issue is that the trip was awful. His family judged me and nit picked me the entire time (telling me I wasn’t cleaning their house right or that we shouldn’t drink when we wanted to have a glass of wine on vacation).  They had also offered their home as a place to stay while we were on vacation (and it’s his parents so he accepted and we brought them gifts) since he really wanted us to visit anyways for the proposal which was a surprise, but they insisted on doing every single thing together. They don’t like to go out for food or drinks, and we didn’t get to do much sightseeing. All in all, it was the kind of trip I consider something I do for my boyfriend, not the kind of trip I would have chosen to have a proposal on. Of course I was happy when he proposed to me, but it felt heavily tainted by his family and the fact that he totally kept mine in the dark (and refused to even tell them he was proposing which again I didn’t know about). I really love this guy. He’s caring and we’ve built an entire life together over the last 6 years. I don’t know what happened here because it’s very unlike him, but I do know that he in theory wanted the proposal to be amazing, which is why he went through the trouble of planning and paying for the trip. It’s just that for me, it wasn’t. This feels like it has tainted things for me. It’s not that I really care about the proposal, but it feels like the start of our marriage was around all of this. How do I get past this on my own? I really don’t want to bum him out more than I have (by expressing I wish my family was involved). I just have this constant anxiety over it that I need to somehow work through.  TL:dr; boyfriend proposed on vacation to visit his family and the trip didn’t go well. Now I can’t stop feeling weird about it UPDATE: I spoke to him and he has agreed to try therapy. So, we have our first appointment next week. I’m also making some lists of things I feel with the in-laws to try and identify boundaries I can set. Thank you all so much for your help! Will update how it goes.","You just got a sneak preview of married life with your in laws. If his parents are nasty to both you and him, and he's not going to defend you or want to back off from visiting them, this needs to be taken into consideration. How much have you two talked about marriage? Did he know it was important to you to have him talk to your family before proposing?  If this is giving you an icky feeling in your gut about actually marrying this person, you need to listen to that and deal with it. You need to talk to your fiance. You need to do pre-marital counseling (everyone should TBH). And you need to take note of how he handles these conversations; is he wanting to just stick his head in the sand, or actually talk about it and deal with it?",3242
hetem6,"You can read the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hczgd8/my_f27_flatmate_f27_has_told_my_boyfriend_m31/). Okay! Firstly, thank you all for your advice (and **no thank you**) to the few who took it upon themselves to DM me to be inappropriate or creepy - wtf, read the room). It gets a little intense, so first I'll just cover some things I wasn't able to in my original post. I trust my boyfriend completely. Even if I didn't, this apartment is large, not massive....I know where that beloved MF is 24/7. A lot of you asked when after my housemates confession he told me about it: he  told me a couple of hours afterwards. He explained to me after we had a chat about it that he was afraid I wouldn't believe him or be angry, because at first he'd thought it was a weird joke that made him uncomfortable, and he felt (rightly so) weirded out. I agree with the bulk of you that her continued touching is harrassment, and while a number suggested he just confront her himself, I empathise with being in a situation without breathing room where someone is sexually harrassing you. It's not easy, and you can quickly find yourself unsure if those brief moments of crossing a line happened. He's not on our lease, and understandably he was concerned about me and the power dynamic in the house (bc her room is a mini granny flat, she pays the bigger share). I also don't believe that it was, as some suggested, a hypomanic episode. I have BP2 and while I understand the 'love rush', she exhibited zero other behaviours, and never tried to contact my BF outside of the weird touching. I also can appreciate there's no way she was actually in 'love'. SO: Yesterday, after a tense few days of trying to avoid her, my BF and I were in the kitchen at breakfast, with her around in the living area. I went to 'our' bathroom (she has an en suite) which is just off the main area to brush my teeth. I walked back out to grab my phone as she was sidling behind my boyfriend who was looking in the fridge, and caught her *running her hand and forearm across his lower back where his tee shirt had ridden up a little*. My boyfriend, who didn't see me, yelped really loudly and just lost it. He yelled at her to ""stop!"" and when they both saw me he starts going ""you see?! You see?! This is what I was talking about!"" I was furious, just whole body anger, and I could see she had now realised he HAD told me about her confession/behaviour, and just sprinted to her room and slammed the door. My BF and I went out for a walk to calm down, and he kept apologising for not being ""more firm"", but he was shaken up - some of you told me I should just confront her head on, which in the moment I 100% sided with, I was so angry for him. He told me he'd rather give her the opportunity to do it diplomatically. I appreciated what you guys said about lock down being extenuating, and in discussion with our mutual friend, I was willing to believe that an element of it was naivete, and a bit of fantasy gone too far. I was willing to be kind to her. When we returned with a plan of action, we knocked on her door but she didn't answer. We tried a couple of times but she wouldn't come out, although she was 'seeing' my Whatsapp messages. Come late afternoon, I was just over it, so I knocked, and told her I was coming in. I sat her down on her bed and told her gently but firmly it was inappopriate, making us uncomfortable, told her she had to get the hell over it/herself if she intended to continue to live with us. She burst into tears and starts crying about how she's ""so sorry"" and what a ""bad person' she is, and she can't believe the pressure of lockdown is getting to her, whatever, and I felt bad. Started sympathising, trying to be compassionate...and then she says ""It's just so unfair that the guy I'm in love with has a really great girlfriend"". Reader, I lost my shit. Unfair, *my ass.* I told her she had a lot of growing up to do, and perspective to learn, and that she owed the house an apology. She started to have a meltdown, a full, weeping, hiccuping snotty meltdown. *AND THEN*  when I stood up to leave, I spotted, in her clothes rack, my freaking shirt. I took it, and went back to my room. My housemate cried loudy with the door OPEN until 7PM (for....attention???) when I cracked. I used our emergency contact sheet, called her mum, told her she had to come pick up my housemate. I've never met this woman who came rushing in like a superstar, but the look of annoyance and embrassament on her face when she arrived and found her 27 y/o daughter having a tantrum told me this wasn't a new part of her personality. My housemate also STFU pretty quickly after she realised her mum was there. They didn't say anything to us, and we just hid in our room until they were gone. I think she'll be gone at least for a while, but I texted her to let her know it would be best if she texted me before she came back. IDK when I'll see her. Technically the lease ends in August so my BF and I think we can make it work and find someone new, and if not, it's not so long til we can resign without her. As a coda to all this?? My BF mentioned if she took a blouse, maybe she took other stuff too. I appreciate some of you may consider this an invasion of privacy, but I did go back in, just to check the clothes rack. I found: a set of my jeans, my tee shirt, one of my boyfriends work shirts, a vinyl I owned, my fucking charm bracelet from when I was a KID from inside my jewellery box, and a sheet of my old antidepressants...this was just what was on the rack/on display. I imagine there's more in the drawers. I don't know if this was the right thing to do, but I left them there for now bc I don't want there to be any 'doubt' she stole them.  There's zero chance she's going to live here any more. Honestly, I hope she does get help. I'm really angry and violated, as is my BF, but I can empathise with the havoc an uncontrolled mental health issue can wreak on your behviour, and while it's still wrong, it still sucks for her to experience it and lose friends. NOTE: *I can't be sure, none of us can! But I feel like maybe (?) she has a histrionic personality disorder.* TL;DR: my relatively normal housemate who told my BF she was in love with him turned out to also be a thief. Yikes!! PS! Our mutual friend has told me another friend who went to school with my housemate had told her a rumour she'd told a bunch of people in their year that she had leukemia. YIKES. (edited for typo)",That’s a whole lot of yikes. I personally think you should go back and get your shit. You know she stole it. She knows. Unless you’re pressing charges it doesn’t matter. Since some of those items are sentimental you run the risk of her coming in the middle of the night and taking it all/ quietly moving out and never seeing your things again.,3830
hfwaxf,"Here is the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/grls25/comment/fs2iubn?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/grls25/comment/fs2iubn?context=3) Tldr: confronted my bofriend about how he treats me after asking for advice on reddit. He cried and talked about his issues, we broke up. I'm much better for it.  Firstly, thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. I got so much from it, and seeing so many supportive comments really helped me. I learned a lot, so thank you all so much. I realised through reading your comments that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. It wasn't communication tips I needed, I needed to get out.  The past month has been so up and down but I wanted to share an update. After a pretty weird “stepping on eggshells” kind of morning, I confronted him about his behaviour and mood swings. I prepped myself for a huge argument and honestly it didn’t go exactly as I expected. First of all he started to deny he was doing anything wrong, but for once I stood my ground. I don’t think he was expecting that. I had lots to say (many of your comments came in useful there), and I tried so hard not to back down.  After a while he kind of… changed. He got upset. He then started saying all sorts of things, that he was sorry but he didn’t realise how his behaviour affected me (though I’d brought it up many times). A little later on he said that he had been thinking for a few months that it was his fault my doctor said I had depression. So that’s a huge contradiction?? He said that for a few weeks he had been thinking about breaking up with me “because it’s my fault that you are this way and breaking up sooner would have been the noble thing to do”, but that he was so torn for ages. He said that’s why he had been even more awful to me lately, that his frustrations were just coming out. Again, contradicting what’s he said about not realising how his behaviour affected me. He said he has never cheated but I’m really not sure if I believe that. Maybe it’s best if I don’t know. Then something really unexpected happened, he started to cry, the first time I have ever seen him cry. He told me that he had been texting a work friend over the past few days about our relationship. He even showed me a message she sent to him which went something like this: “you have a wonderful, textbook girlfriend and you are fucking it up because you are being an ass. This is why everyone at work thinks you’re a psychopath. You are so cold and bad when it comes to feelings”. So I guess it wasn’t just me who found his behaviour not normal?? He cried even more and said that he doesn’t feel close to people, that there’s only a handful of people he lets in and he doesn’t know why he does that. He said that even being around his immediate family was cold and formal and he doesn’t know why he is like that and can’t connect with people, and that’s also why he throws himself into work so much. I told him that if he didn’t get help, he would end up a very lonely old man. In that moment I felt pretty strong and proud of myself. So as you may have guessed, we broke up. Part of me for a while even thought about trying to save it and work at it, and now that I look back I can’t believe I was ever even thinking that. He kept saying “I just don’t know what to do for the best, should we break up or not?” But doing so was absolutely the right thing. I’ve since had many friends coming forward saying they didn’t trust him, something was off etc. Regarding the girl I talked about, his ex who he cheated on his other ex with- I could see on her brothers Instagram a video of my ex smirking at his phone and the caption was “he’s thinking about my sister ;)” to which he replied with another winky face so… what does that say. But I’m not looking Instagram at this stuff anymore. On the day we broke up he packed some bags and left, he told me to stay with a friend. It turns out that that friend was his exes brother, and he’s been living there for a month. I will be moving into a new place in 2 weeks and even though he has gone to stay with his friend he is still paying his share of the rent, he just swings by to pick up some stuff every now and then when I’m at work, I haven't actually seen him. For the past few months I’ve been feeling really low, with barely any energy. I’m picking myself back up again and though it’s a slow process, I’m coming back into myself. I’m determined that I’m not going to let anyone make me feel like that again. I’m not sure if I needed to write all of that and if you guys needed all of those details, but writing this was quite cathartic. I guess I would just say, to anyone who is reading this and my original post, who is in a relationship that they feel horrible in, just leave. It’s hard, but please leave. You will feel SO much better. Thanks again, Reddit.",Now his ex can deal with that baggage. You’ll find someone more compatible for you when you’re ready- win/win,490
hn0j6j,"Sooo in the middle of this whole pandemic we’ve managed to start a family. Life is tough with a one-month old but I’m afraid my husband’s very helpful behavior is actually very unhelpful. My husband grew up in a big family and is very familiar/comfortable with the care of children and babies, including small infants. I had the opposite experience. When we decided to have a baby, for me it was kind of as if we’d decided to start a llama farm. I had zero experience or prior knowledge and I had to do (and still do) a ton of research. It doesn’t help that I have severe PPD. I have already been seeing a therapist for a long time for depression/anxiety and have been put on an SSRI by my GP. So if you tell me to see a therapist and/or get medicated I’ll ignore you because I’ll know you haven’t even bothered to read my post. The problem is that my husband (and his mother, who is actually a lovely and helpful woman who is bugging me for the same reason he is) is always swooping in to show me how to actually do things.  I don’t have the muscle memory to execute the optimal way to fix a diaper or fill a formula bottle. My logical brain is confident that I’m not going to kill my baby but the depression and constant wearing down by husband and MIL is getting to me. They also know I’m not going to kill the baby but they always seem to know JUST what to do and when they see me struggling with something it’s like they’re hovering with itchy fingers just waiting to take over. The even more annoying thing is they’re right; whatever they do to soothe the baby and get him to sleep works like a charm. So on top of knowing I need to learn this shit myself I feel like a failure. I feel watched and surveilled in my own home and like I’m not getting one-on-one time with the baby. I feel incompetent and helpless. I can feel learned helplessness setting in. I feel useless. I’ve chosen not to breastfeed for several reasons so it’s like the baby really doesn’t need me. (I logically know this isn’t true because of attachment and all that but again, the severe depression speaks.) I know someone’s going to be like wHy dOn’T yOu JuSt TaLk tO HiM. Well no shit, I HAVE. Multiple times. I’ve told him he needs to like, go out somewhere and take a break and just let me handle things so I can learn and bond with the baby on my own. He says “Okay, okay, I get it,” and then seems to promptly forget we ever had the conversation. He amazingly has selective amnesia regarding this specific topic. Ditto his MIL. He’s a very fatherly person so he wants to be all over the baby all the time, which obviously I get, but it results in this issue. My family all lives far away so I’m stuck with these two. I really have vivid and deeply satisfying fantasies of taking my sharpest kitchen knife to both of their faces (which I want to say is just the PPD talking, but seriously I’m infuriated). But outwardly I’m too tired to protest. I’m tired all the time and I just want to be left alone. I feel like I’m being tortured in some kind of weird way and it kills me that we’re not all able to just chill and enjoy this special time with the newborn. I told husband I think maybe we should try couples’ counseling and his jaw very nearly hit the floor. He’s a great guy overall obviously so he was open to this idea but I could tell he was totally dumbfounded and couldn’t tell what the problem was. So I told him I just don’t feel heard and I feel like both he and his mom are overbearing. So then he got sad and was all like “I’m just trying to help, I know it’s tough to be a new mom.” I got REALLY angry with him and said some not very nice things which I regret. My husband has (bizarrely) never dealt with mental illness so I think he’s really freaked out by the PPD. Later I heard him talking to his mom in whispered and concerned tones about my mental health. So I feel like he is pathologizing this specific problem. I feel like I’m going crazy. Which I guess I already am. But you know. Is it going to kill either of them to watch me fumble a bottle or deal with a couple blowouts a few times?  My Amazing Husband I Can’t Complain About has already taken it on himself to find a couples’ counselor. Which obnoxiously is making me feel guilty, like, am I really complaining about nothing when I clearly have such a great guy? I mean, I know I’m not. But it’s driving me crazy. Any advice in advance of us seeing this counselor would be really appreciated. TL;DR: MIL and Husband are childcare know-it-alls and preventing me from learning and bonding with the baby on my own. Yes, I talked to him and no, it hasn’t solved the problem.","You should tell him that you want MIL to leave and give you some space to be a new mom. You feel like it's him and her vs. you. Tell him that you need him to back you up. It sounds like he's smothering the hell out of you and that would drive anyone crazy. Get used to telling him and MIL to give you space. ""I'm changing the diaper. Go into the other room and let me handle this,"" or ""I'm filling the bottle. Go sit down and do xyz."" Get used to this phrase: ""I am doing this thing. I will tell you if I want help."" When he forgets, reiterate that you are doing it and you will ask for help if you want it. Really nail it into him. Honestly, if you have to, drag him to the doctor with you and explain all this to the doctor.",3336

So i'm 23 yo now, and a lot has changed, after my last post, i spent the next 2 years doing nothing because i was broken. I went back to study something i loved this year and got my diploma (BTS in France if you care, it's not much but it's alright.), and i'm now gonna push for more since i loved this year very much. My ex-girlfriend ended up dating someone else richer and more handsome than me, but whatever. We're still friends tho, being the only woman on earth who has ever made me laugh. I did not date anyone else since, most women i thought i had a good feeling with did not find me attractive so i didn't push. Well all in all, it's alright, i got my driver license too, your past comments ended up being useful for me in a way, even if i acted 2 years later. Sorry for the typos i'm not fluent enough in english. Tldr: I'm doing better career-wise. Edit : I'm reading all your messages you are all very kind, I chose to respond to your comments with my main account ""Limanys"" because I don't care if my friends see my posts now. Thank you all","I’m proud of you. You identified a problem and you made the change to better yourself, even if it took you a while to get going. You got this friend.",799
hpkndz,"[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hoeaet/my_24f_boyfriend_25m_is_being_passive_aggressive/)  So first off, I appreciate everyone's advice. I broke up with my boyfriend! I just couldn't get past him not taking my injury and pain seriously and basically blaming me for it. It was really hurtful that I was in pain and he didn't seem to care at all. It was a relatively smooth breakup. There was no arguing or anything. I told him how I felt and all he said was ""sorry"" but it wasn't a sincere apology. It was more of a ""sorry you feel that way."" So I'm moving out. I'm in the process of beginning to move all my stuff out which I think is the worst part. It's especially not fun on a broken foot! My aunt and uncle live about 40 minutes away and they are more than happy to let me stay with them while I look for a place.  Again, I really appreciate everyone's advice. I'm happy with the outcome and think it was for the best. If he couldn't take me seriously now, I don't think i could ever trust him to take me seriously or be supportive in a medical situation again.  TL;DR: Broke up with my boyfriend today after he didn't take my injury seriously. I am moving out and feel good about my decision.","Yeah, he was treating you like garbage, and deserved to be thrown out as refuse in response. Leaving toxicity is so freeing once you're away. As I said to an earlier poster, when I left that asshole, I was over it. Almost immediately. Just couldn't give any less fucks. Good on you.",689
hqzk0u,"My boyfriend (26) was in a relationship with a girl for 3 years from 20 to 23. She's from the other side of the world and missed her home to much so eventually she went back and that's why they broke up. Over the 9 months that I've been with my boyfriend he's told me a few things about her, all postive. From his friends I heard that they were THE dream couple and that she was a very kind and lovely person. Some said that they think he's never going to love again like he loved her which obviously hurt. Well today it got weird. Apparently when they broke up she gave him a letter. Amongst other things it says that she wishes him happiness blah blah. But then it says that he should give another letter to the girl he finds love with again. Apparently she enclosed that letter.  He gave it to me unopened. I didn't know what to expect. But she was so nice in her letter. Basically said I'm very lucky to have his love that I should cherish it and that I must be a great person if he's chosen me. Then she included some anecdotal tips on how to make him happy. I just feel weird. This woman seems to be a saint. I don't know how to feel about this letter and the whole thing. Should I contact her? But what would I even say? Isn't it strange that my bf or anyone else hasn't mentioned a single negative thing about her? Somehow this letter made me jealous because I could feel a level of closeness that I don't have with my boyfriend. What should I make of this? ￼ Tldr. Bf gave me a letter his ex wrote to me.","To me its weird to have the tips in there. Like I get it, they had a great relationship that ended, but this is your relationship. Those tips might not be you and now they might rattle around in your brain. I would personally hand the letter back to your bf, tell him that she seems like a nice person, but you want to make a boundary that you are not interested in her being a part of your relationship with him. That you need to make sure he is on board with you 100% and not just because you are a second choice. And he should hear you out and support you. This is an important moment where he needs to make sure that his past relationship isn't overshadowing the current one, and sadly just from comments its starting to here and there. He should never have given you the letter. It was a selfishness of her part to do that honestly. She's not dead, she's far away, but if she ever wants to come back now you have to worry and consider if he wouldn't up and leave you for her. 9 months is long enough to know how things are going, and where things are at. You can't compete with a ""saint"", so you shouldn't bother. Be you, be the best you you can be, because that is what you should do. Don't try to be her, or be the relationship he had. You and your bf have your own relationship that needs to grow and become stronger.",5770
hrddje,"If you want to read the old post: [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hpi6lz/boyfriend_and_his_girl_best_friend_on_social/) I read all the replies and I got many messages for an update. I appreciate all the advice that everyone gave. I called the bird brain last night and basically went off on him. He had explained that they previously did have a past many years ago but they had reconnected after his last relationship but it was strictly platonic but THEN... He tells me that he has herpes? That's one thing. Then tells me that I should possibly get tested. The last time we were physically together was in May. I confronted him and asked him if he slept with someone and he admitted that he slept with one person (pretty sure there were more). He said it meant nothing and it was only physical and there was nothing emotional about it. I asked why he did it and he said it was more of a ""last hurrah"" before he moved but it was with someone totally random. I asked how you meet someone random and he hesitated and said Tinder. Hearing all of this I didn't know what to say and was in complete shock. He said he was sorry and it didn't mean anything. He said he understood if I wanted to break up but would still want to be friends because ""I'm really important in his life"". I obviously immediately broke up with him but it feels like a huge weight is off of my shoulders. I don't plan on being friends with him either since it shows that he’s trying to have me around in his life, more of a benefit to him. He's a piece of shit and I'm glad he has herpes :) Another UPDATE: There were things I needed to get off my chest for my own closure and so I sent him a message saying that I’m not comfortable being friends after everything that he’s done and he’s trying to keep me around and what not. He responded back with a few messages but the one I thought that was hilarious was when he said “I am upset about the whole situation and the prospect of losing you in my life. You are an amazing woman and it was a pleasure getting to know you. I wish you the best and hope down the line, we are able to reconcile.”  I realized with his response, he never apologized for hurting me or about the situation itself and saying HE’S hurt? I’m glad I got out of it sooner then later. I removed him off all my socials as well  Thank you everyone for the comments and support. I’ll make an appointment soon to get tested   TLDR: The tool slept with someone else while we were still exclusively together and is a piece of shit","Wow, the level he went to trying to defend his cheating is vile. I'm glad it's over and you can move on and find someone better (honestly that bar ain't high though).",2176
hro3xn,"Me and my boyfriend have been living together for about a year now and for a while he's been really interested in virtual reality. Now the problem is that our tiny studio apartment isn't big enough to jump around in. He knows this, I know this, and we've had multiple conversations about how it's a shame we don't live in some huge house where we could dedicate an entire room to something like that. I went out yesterday for a walk and a picnic yesterday and came back to my boyfriend dismantling our bed. I assumed something had broken and asked what had happened. Nothing was broken. He'd managed to order an oculus quest headset and had made the executive decision that we could swap our double bed for a Japanese futon?? There is no fucking room for this. Even if we lived on the ground floor (which we don't), and I was willing to sleep on the floor (which I'm not), the room just isn't big enough. It would dominate the entire room. Am I supposed to crouch in the kitchen whilst he plays? Our entire home is being compromised for what is effectively a video game. I honestly don't really know what to say. He thinks he's being entirely reasonable to do this without involving me. I don't even know what to say to him here since the whole thing seems so ridiculous and he's so obviously being unreasonable yet is oblivious and keeps saying I'll really enjoy vr and it'll all be worth it. I told him I was worried he'll damage the TV or my art supplies and he is convinced it won't be a problem as they have sensors for that. I love my boyfriend and he's always been entirely reasonable and level headed until now and we always discuss everything. How do I get through to him about this? If it wasn't so difficult right now I'd be considering moving out or leaving. I told him I'd throw it out the window when it arrived unless he was going to sit down and have a serious conversation about this but he just won't take anything I say seriously.  TL;DR My boyfriend bought a vr headset and wants to remove our bed to play it in our tiny studio apartment and can't see this is unreasonable.","he was dismantling the bed when you were away so he could finish the job before you got there, so that you’d be powerless. he doesn’t care about your opinion enough to talk about it with you..or enough to use his own common sense!? he definitely needs a good shake up, you’ve got to give him an ultimatum cos he’s acting like a child so he needs to get treated like one really. because currently it seems like he thinks his actions don’t have consequences, so you have to show him they do.",3793
hxzwcl,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hm1wdi/mym26_wifef26_isnt_happy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf Thank you everyone for the advice from the original post. I just wanted to give the community an update. My wife finally got back yesterday from leaving to go see her sister. We talked for a little bit yesterday, but still came to the same thing she has been telling me. She doesn’t want to be with me because she doesn’t feel in love, emotionally connected, or intimate towards me. She views me as a friend. I told her she needed to choose either we work on this and go to counseling or it’s a divorce and we cut ties. She couldn’t decide and said to give her the weekend.  This morning I woke up early, made her breakfast and brought it to her in bed. Then took her out to eat for lunch and desert trying to just spark anything to see if she would agree to work on it. Well we sat down again after getting back and she said she wanted a divorce and she was 100% on that.  It was tough. A lot of crying, sadness, hurt, and all the emotions one would feel. I ended up just going to my room and she left for the night. I decided to get out and do something so I jogged and listed to some music for a bit. It helped.  I came to the realization that we all have such little time on earth and I don’t want to waste it moping around. I want to improve myself physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want to just enjoy life and find myself again. So I’m going to do that and one day I might meet someone who is perfect to continue the journey of life with me.  So I’m still sad and hurt, but all that to say I’m moving forward and trying to be positive. Thank you all for your support. tl;dr Wife wants a divorce. I’m trying to stay positive and move one.","The end of a relationship is hard but it’s also such a great opportunity for growth, self compassion, and fun. The initial part of the separation is hard but just know that you will be okay, slowly things will get better.  You’re still so young, you’re going to find someone that’s a better match for you. Just give yourself time to grieve and take care of yourself. When my bf and I broke up I listened to “Breakup Recover Podcast” by Barbara Stevens, she’s so calming and has a way of making you feel cared for and safe. There were days where I felt like shit but I would force myself to listen to it and I never regretted it.  Hope you find happiness within yourself soon!",1655
hzkdbw,"TL;DR  Mom is very excited that I’m going to have a spare bedroom. I’m flooded with apprehension. I don’t know if my feelings are justified or not. ——————————————————————- My partner [24M] and I are moving into a 1300 sq ft 2/2 townhome this week. Our current apartment is a snug 350 sq ft 1/1.  I’ve been working from home out of our bedroom since mid-March. This hasn’t done wonders for my mental wellbeing. Moving into a bigger place has been a light at the end of the tunnel these last few months.  I’m particularly happy about having a second bedroom, as my partner agreed that I should turn it into my home office. (I expect to continue working from home for quite a while longer.) In my excitement, I told both my parents all about the new place as soon as our application was approved.  (Context on my parents: My parents are divorced. They live in my hometown, roughly an eight hour drive away.) When I mentioned the second bedroom in the townhome to my mom, she immediately began talking about staying in “her guest room”. I told her that I was going to turn the spare room into a home office, but she just replied “with a sleeper sofa!” She then began talking excitedly about how she’d be able to drive up and visit “often”. I didn’t know what to say, but something in my gut turned. My mom works at an airport in a COVID hotspot. I have asthma that gets worse when I get sick, so I can’t take any chances with COVID. Knowing this, my mom has been trying for months to push me to visit her, and she’s been asking repeatedly if she can come visit me. (She has outright refused to quarantine herself for two weeks prior to seeing me.) I put my foot down and told her that any travel was out of the question, and she kind of accepted that. She still complains about it every time we talk though, and she still asks even though she knows the answer is no. Recently, she asked me if I needed her to come visit to help me move. After that didn’t work, she asked if she could come visit in August to “see the new place” and celebrate her birthday. I felt guilty about saying no, so I gave a very noncommital response. At this point, I’m not even sure if I’d want to see her even if she did quarantine for two weeks beforehand. My mom gets way too pushy when she doesn’t get her way, and it makes me very uncomfortable. The problem is, she’s also extremely giving and generous, so it makes me feel guilty denying her requests.  She’s constantly offering to give me money I don’t need, and she tries to lend a helping hand in every situation without being asked. She has offered to pay for graduate school for me *and* pay for my living expenses, because she wants me back in school. (We had that arrangement when I was in undergrad, but the money was never as reliable as she said it would be. Having independence and a stable job has been a godsend. I’m never relying on her financially again.) I almost think she’s generous so that she has leverage to push people around with. I don’t think she’s doing it in a conscious, malicious way, though. I think she does it because having control and feeling like a good person makes her happy. In the past, when I’ve told her “no”, she has gone straight to guilting me.  On one occasion, she wanted to stay the night with my partner and I in our tiny little apartment. I told her that my partner’s family, who live in town, would be more than happy to have her as a guest. In fact, they had already prepared the guest room for her. She cried and said that I “didn’t want her”, and she basically had a meltdown. I told her we didn’t have room or an air mattress, so she’d have to sleep on the floor. I told her that this was unacceptable, and that I would not allow my mother to sleep on grubby carpet. She then threatened to drive all the way *back* home overnight, after having driven all the way *from* home that day. When we didn’t back down, she went through with the threat. I couldn’t sleep that night out of fear, worrying about her crashing the car from sleep deprivation.  My partner has held my mother in poor regard ever since that incident. He really doesn’t want her to stay with us in the future. I could blame things on him and tell her that he’s the reason why she can’t stay with us, but that’s not fair to him. Plus, she might try to retaliate in some way, and I don’t want that. ***Actual TL;DR, after writing out my feelings: How do I tell my mother that my home office isn’t her guest bedroom? How do I tell her that she can’t come visit me in August? I don’t even want to have her sleeping on an air mattress in my home office, because I’m uncomfortable leaving her alone with my belongings. She has gone through my things at least once in the past. She keeps texting me, asking me how moving is going. Every time I see her texts, I feel a mix of discomfort and guilt. It makes me want to throw my phone away.  Reddit, please help? ————————————————————— Edit: Wow, I’ve never had a post receive this much attention before.  It’s interesting how many comments I’ve received guilting me for not wanting my mom to visit right now. The majority of comments were really constructive and supportive, but a noticeable minority basically told me “you’ll miss your mom when she dies” and “she’s divorced and lonely and loves you, you ungrateful child”. Here I go JADE-ing at those comments. (Good term, thank y’all for teaching it to me!) - I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she’s completely disregarding COVID, and I am in a high-risk group. My dad’s health isn’t great either and I worry about him, as they live near one another and still see each other. - I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she doesn’t care for LGBT people, and both my partner and I are bisexual. - I’m uncomfortable around my mom because I went on a friendly mall date with a (gasp) non-white boy once in my teens, and she told me she “didn’t want a nappy-haired grandchild”. - I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she has had a history of psychosis. When she’s under stress, she can act in ways that don’t always make sense. When I was little, it was worse, and she scared me a few times. - I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she’s not very good with money, and she has asked me for money before. Even though she makes thousands more a month than I do. (She wanted to buy a big-ticket item, and didn’t want to save for a month to buy it.) - I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she handled divorcing my dad really poorly, and didn’t seem to care for how I felt at all. I was twelve. She discouraged me from talking to my dad, took me away traveling on weekends I was supposed to see him, and she tried to get a restraining order on him. She had no reason to do that. She actually took me with her to court that day, and it was all I could do not to run over and hug my dad. I think I did hug him, actually, and he had to tell me it wasn’t allowed. He and I were so close before the divorce, and we’re still trying to fix our relationship. - I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she didn’t step in or do anything when I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with an adult male as a teenage girl. He was 22, and I was 16, and she let him sleep in her house. Of course I thought it was a good idea at first, but I was in too deep very quickly. He was coercive, mean, and selfish. I needed my mom to step in and act like a parent, maybe by kicking him out and forbidding me from seeing him. Instead, she enabled the whole thing. I had to “break up” with this man, and that was only after he tried to coerce me into marrying him. - I’m uncomfortable with my mom because she always wants me to approve of her bad decisions, and gets angry when I don’t. - I’m uncomfortable around my mom because when she saw that I was anxious as a little kid, she forced pills on me and took me to a psych ward (completely unprompted, I was discharged the same day). When I got “better” after gaining some independence, I told her that I stopped taking the pills because they made me feel sick. She then freaked out and told me I needed to take them, or I’d get anxious again and “lose everything” that I’d built. I’ve been trying to make myself “well” for years. But I’ve never lost control of my life since I got it. - I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she  wants me to get married and have her grandchildren, but I would never want her to influence any child I ever had. But yes. I’m guilty. Bad and ungrateful child. Going to regret having boundaries when she dies. For sure. (Shame about all the time I missed with my dad that I’ll never get back when *he* dies, but yeah.) I may not be sure how to have a healthy relationship with my mom, but acquiescing to guilt isn’t it, chief. Thanks tho.","Boundaries, boundaries, boundaries! (check out r/raisedbynarcissists or r/justnoMIL for some info and tips from those in your shoes on setting boundaries with unhealthy family members) Every time you give an inch, she takes a mile. Why do you think she's so ""generous"" and wants to pay for everything? Because then you're dependent on her and/or you ""owe"" her and it's harder to say no to someone who's paying your rent/tuition/etc. I'd start by telling her the truth and establishing the boundary at the same time: ""Mom, I've been thinking about our conversation regarding your birthday and I'm just not comfortable with you coming to visit next month and I'm not sure when I will be due to the virus and my health issues. I need you to know that your repeated requests to visit have felt like pressure at best and manipulative at worst, and whether intentional or not I can't continue to worry about having to tell you ""no"" all the time. Moving forward, I will have to end our conversations and hang up if you insist on bringing up these topics or discussing them when I've made it clear I'm not interested."" Then follow through: if she asks to visit, lays on the guilt-trip, or pressures you then just hang up the phone/zoom call/stop responding to the texts.",2431
hzwqcy,"**UPDATE:**  Thank you so much for all of the advice, and kind words.  You guys are great!  I've been very hesitant to use reddit up until now but you guys have proven my skepticism wrong!  I've decided I most definitely should write a letter for sure explaining how much he has helped me, and how grateful I am.  I think it's probably best to avoid any strange verbiage like ""father figure"" or ""guardian angel"" just because I don't want to make myself uncomfortable more than anything. Also!  I think based on a lot of your suggestions it might make me feel good if I got him a gift. Early on in our friendship he and I connected on our mutual love for fishing.  He is an avid spin fisherman, and I love fly-fishing, and actually am very good at it.  He mentioned to me that he'd love to learn to fly fish one day but never has.  Would it be cool if I bought him a nice fly rod and reel, and just added a P.S. to the note that I'll gladly teach him how to fly fish some day?  Or would that be weird?  Let me know!  Also also!  Anyone know any good psychiatrists?   Thanks for all your feedback, observations, kind words, and advice everyone!!! **ORIGINAL POST:** Most of my life after high school has been me skipping from job to job, either because of my inability to perform the job, laziness, or just plain rudeness on my part.  This probably all has a lot to do with a lack of a good relationship with my father.  I have struggled, even in childhood, to find anything I'm passionate about.  Often when I try something new I will get really excited about it and then be done with it after a week or two.  This pattern has lead to severe depression, and terrible relationships in most parts of my life.  I have a few friends who are close and supportive, but they are so keenly aware of how untrustworthy I am, just because I change my mind about who I am, and what I believe so often. About a year and a half ago, I went to get my haircut at a barbershop near my house.  I had recently become miserable in my latest endeavor: teaching music.  I had never met the barber, and he had never met me, but he asked me a few questions, and I grudgingly answered.  He stopped cutting my hair, looked me in the eye and said.  ""You just need to be a barber.""  I laughed, and he reiterated, ""No, I'm serious, there's a school right down the street.  You need to be a barber."" Flash foward a year and a half.  I've graduated barber school, and I have a job cutting hair.  I've never been more excited or passionate about anything in my life (aside from getting married).  The process of getting to this point has been insanely difficult, but also extraordinarily fulfilling.  I've never felt this way.  It's like no matter how much life sucks, I always have comfort in knowing that I am on a road to becoming a better barber.  To put it simply: this is the first time I've stuck with ANYTHING for more than 8 months, and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface! During every step of the process of becoming a barber, this man has been like a guardian angel.  He not only directed me to the school, but somehow got my tuition rate lowered by speaking with the school owner without my knowledge.  He encouraged me every time I felt unsure or afraid, and let me stand next to him for hours on in at his shop and taught me everything I didn't get to learn at school.  Tricks of the trade, and his special secrets that he's learned over the years.  My wife (I know unbelievable that I'm married given my background right?) was ready to divorce me, and break up with me, but this man AND HIS WIFE counseled us, and helped us make it through the year of barber school.  As the icing on the cake, he secured a job for me, cutting right next to him, at his brothers barbershop. This is just a sampling of the pure graciousness this person has shown me.  Every time I'm around him, I want to express to him how thankful I am, and how I want to make him proud.  It's like he's the father I never had.  But for some reason, I'm afraid that he will be put off if I thank him?  I'm not sure what it is.  I feel like I owe this man everything that I care about.  If it weren't for him I'd be working in Macdonalds, single, and probably suicidal.  (no hate for McDonalds workers, it's just not for me).  I just want to show him that his grace has NOT been taken for granted.  I want to make him proud.  I know this is probably really lame for this sub, but... it's so hard for me to wrap my head around how to repay him, or thank him without coming off as weird. He has a son of his own, and I don't want to make him uncomfortable by making him feel like \*I\* look at him like a father figure?  I don't know if that's wrong or not.   Any advice is welcome.... please! &#x200B; **TL;DR** My guardian angel helped (and is still helping me) get my shit together, and I'm an awkward man baby that feels like I have a new father and want to tell him I immensely appreciate him but don't know how to not seem weird about it?",Nothing wrong in expressing gratitude. Express it in ways you can and in ways you know how. ,2460
i1chj5,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34fd9v/me_23_f_with_my_bf_21_m_of_8_months_regarding/ Hey all! Reddit emailed me about verifying this account, which I completely forgot even existed, so I checked it out and went back and read my post from 5 years ago. I read through the comments again, and I figured maybe it'd be worth posting an update since honestly, I have no idea how I was defending this person at the time... Pretty much, I made that post about my boyfriend thinking it was ""very weird"" that I lived with my brother at a point where my boyfriend and I had been dating for a few months shy of a year. One month after I made that post, my brother ended up moving out anyway, and my boyfriend and I moved to another apartment (all planned, and just a matter of the lease ending), so the situation had mostly resolved itself. However, LET ME TELL YOU, holy shit, I wish I would have taken the advice given to me in the post, and I cringed reading through this 5-year-old post because a lot of the comments were so true, and I should have just left. I put up with his shit for a total of 4 years before he broke up with me (""for good"" - we actually broke up probably 10-12 different times that lasted anywhere from a few hours to a couple of weeks).  The entire time, he was definitely jealous of my brother. Pretty much, he ended up admitting that my brother was a guy who commanded a room, people always looking to him (like, he's sort of a ""leader"" in his friend group), and making people laugh. That was the type of person my (now ex-) boyfriend wanted to be, so he hated that my brother was that. In fits of rage, even in a *completely* unrelated argument, he would randomly be like ""I bet you've fucked your brother!"" So much shit coming from him, but I think that the combination of he and I in a relationship together was just incredibly toxic and made it so hard for me to be able to think about things rationally.  There was a comment in my original post about someone wishing I could see the situation from the outside, and looking back at that post, I feel like I finally am, and it's just cringeworthy. Someone had PM'd me a list of signs of an abusive relationship, and looking back, he definitely checks off most of those. I had said that he rarely lies to me, but in retrospect, our relationship was FULL of lies - some major ones that I recall from before I made that post, so I'm not sure if I was lying to myself then or what. I'm in a much better place now, and have had a new boyfriend for about 2 years. I think the takeaway here, and why I wanted to post an update is for people perhaps in a similar situation (regardless of what it might be about) to consider. If your SO is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to something, don't expect it to be okay just because you can maybe avoid that topic in the future. It's possible that it will still come up, and it's very likely that this isn't a red flag to ignore just because it's easy to ignore. It's still a raging red flag, and has a lot of implications for your relationship in the future.  --- **tl;dr**: Stayed with boyfriend of < 1 year at the time for about 4 years. He was super jealous of my brother and thought living with him was very weird. Post-breakup, I finally have clarity and he was ridiculous.","Thanks for posting this.

i4jkl6,"I'm not sure how I ended up in this horrible place in my life but I guess it's because I believed what I wanted to believe rather than what was obviously right in front of me. &#x200B; I won't bore you with all the details but suffice to say he's 100% my type and I've always been gaga over him. When we met 7 years ago I had very limited sexual experience. He had plenty. Right from the beginning, he was very take-it-or-leave it towards sex. I asked him several times if he was attracted to me. He always said yes, but that he just was on medication that dampened desire / exhausted from work. We had very little sex and I was insecure and never initiated. I figured he'd had SO much experience that if he wanted sex he'd initiate. &#x200B; We were like best friends who had sex sometimes (like maybe every 6 weeks). This was not enough for me but I accepted it because I loved him so much and I was too shy to have a really frank discussion. Nor did I want to make him feel bad. I also was always there for him in every way (emotionally, practically, etc). He really grew to rely on me because he suffers from ADHD and depression and often needed my support in many ways (which I was happy to give). &#x200B; There were many hiccups. I caught him texting other women a few times. He watched porn a lot. I figured he was intimacy avoidant or something. But I truly loved him. &#x200B; We got married. Once we had a huge fight and during it our lack of sex came up. He was always suggesting it was my fault but I didn't think it was. He'd call me a prude but I honestly couldn't understand what he was talking about. He cited the fact that I never got on top. I always feel awkward on top and it doesn't feel good and he never told me he liked it so I didn't think it mattered. I brought up the fact that he always wanted oral but never once had returned the favour (still hasn't...not once). We were fighting and it was escalating and he told me ""*if you want to know why I've never given you oral it's because you disgust me sexually*"". I was hurt and shocked but he later told me he didn't mean that. &#x200B; We've had several more fights over the years and once he told me he loved me deeply but wasn't attracted to me. He took that back too and said he didn't mean it. But our sex life never improved at all. &#x200B; Recently he got angry at me and called me fat. Later I asked him why he called me that and he said he was sorry for being rude, but that I have to admit that I'm fat. I am overweight (BMI of 27) but so is he. I honestly didn't think he viewed me as ""fat"". We talked a lot and he said he loved me very much and I was perfect for him because he fell in love with me, but that no, my body type is not his type at all. He has always preferred petite athletic women. &#x200B; It just all hit me. Our sex life has always sucked not because of medication or depression, but because he never was very attracted to me at all. He was with me because I provided companionship and love and support and he grew to rely on me and love me. But he's never felt any passion towards me. &#x200B; He says it doesn't really matter because he truly loves me and he's willing to work on having a better sex life with me. He says when we grow old we'll be unattractive anyway and love is all that matters. &#x200B; I'm just hurt and freaked out because I've been living this lie thinking we both felt the same way about each other when we clearly do not.  &#x200B; I'm wondering.....does it even really matter? Does ""lust"" matter? Does it matter if I'm not his physical ideal? Can we still have a happy marriage if we are both in love and committed to each other even if he apparently doesn't have any real sexual feelings towards me?  &#x200B; I'm so confused and I'd hate to make a mistake and get divorced from someone I really love just because he doesn't find me hot. Can anyone help me view this more clearly? &#x200B; tldr: husband has never been ""into"" me and I'm unsure if I should continue the marriage.","So your husband has called you a prude, fat, and ""disgusting sexually""?  Forget the whole 'is it a big deal if he's not physically attracted to me?' thing. Do you *really* want to be with a guy who says those kinds of things to you?",5666
i4nbdc," TL;DR: my boyfriend of almost 3 years told me a series of “white lies” that to me, seem more serious. Can’t tell if I’m overreacting or if this is actually indicative of a bigger problem.   I’ll try to make this as short as possible but it’s going to be long as hell because there is so much lying going on. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years, living together for 2. We have a pretty good relationship, obviously with ups and downs but we make it work and are happy.  A little background on me/my boyfriend for context:  I come from a single-parent home. My father was absent. My mother was/is by no means perfect, but she did her best with what she had. We were poor. Life was never easy for us but we had each other. Since I was pretty young, I’ve wanted to pay her back someday. I’ve worked incredibly hard to be able to do so. I help her financially as much as I can and regularly pay her bills/send her cash. I’m also her only living child now as my brother passed away 5 years ago which basically left me to help her. I don’t care, I love my mother, and the right thing to do is to help her when she needs it. But is is stressful.  This is relevant because my boyfriend described coming from a somewhat similar past, and it is something we have bonded over. Having the mutual experiences seemed to bring us closer. He told me he also helped his parents financially, and we would often vent to each other about the stress it brings. I am not one to confide in many people, so having someone who I felt like actually understood me, was meaningful to me.   So here is where the lies come in and I need someone to either tell me I’m not crazy and this is fucked up, or that I am crazy and this isn’t a huge deal. I’m fine with either.  When we met, my boyfriend lived in a condo in a pretty swanky part of the city (I live in the US northeast). He told me he owned that apartment/condo. I found this to be interesting/odd because he was 28 at the time and I know this property is upwards of $650,000 on the low end and he was in an entry-level job for only like 2 yrs so the numbers just didn’t really add up. Whatever, maybe he’s good at saving?  But then, since living together, I never once saw a piece of mail for a mortgage payment, electric bill, taxes, nothing. Not for 2 whole years. Very odd. Also, when we started living together, he didn’t have his room rented out in the former apartment yet so he was still responsible for that portion of the rent. He would send a Venmo payment to his mother on the first of every month for his portion. I don’t own property, but I can’t think of a scenario where I would Venmo my mother to pay the mortgage on a property I supposedly own. Getting more odd.  He would then go to his parents house for an afternoon and come back really upset. Usually when I would ask why, it was because they were having financial problems and he needed to help them out. I totally understood this and supported him. He literally has cried on my shoulder about this many times.  He tried to start a company years back and ended up getting into debt somehow. He told me this debt was $17,000 and that he paid it off. I’m confused because I met him only 2-3 years after the supposed debt accrued/company dissolved and it was already paid off? He told me when he moved back home after the business failed, he was $17k in debt and living at his parents house working at a minimum wage job. How someone with a minimum wage job pays off that much debt in 3 years, I’ll never know! We got into a fight a few weeks ago and I finally had enough and confronted him about these things. Long story short - he doesn’t help his parents, they actually pay his phone bill, and this was all a lie. He doesn’t own that apartment, he didn’t pay off that debt from his company (he initially told me his parents helped pay it off and then like 3 mins later “came clean” and said that his business partner paid it off so I have literally no idea what the truth is there) and if anything, in my eyes, his parents are the ones who are financially supporting him. So now, I’m dating a 31 yr old man who doesn’t pay his own phone bill, was lying to me and/or completely fabricating aspects of his life for 3 years, and then when confronted about it, continued to make up lies and then came clean about them 5 mins later. I’m obviously concerned that he could lie for this long, about fundamentally important things like our values, and so on. I sincerely thought I would marry this man, he seemed to understand me like no one else and to be a truly caring and genuine person. Now I’m having a hard time rationalizing actually planning a life around someone who would not only lie about their background and family etc. but also financial aspects. Aside from that, I now can’t tell what is the truth and what is a lie. I’ve also noticed other things he has lied about, called him out on it and he has denied it outright to my face. I see this as a form of gaslighting as I KNOW I’m not wrong but he is trying to convince me otherwise. Am I overreacting? Is this a white lie that went haywire? Or is this actually a series of complete and utter bullshit used to manipulate me? And also, is it insane for me to actually consider a life with this man? Any advice is appreciated.","This isn't a white lie, this is a huge web of lies on which he's built the foundations of your relationship. I would forever be wondering what else he's lied about. Get out.",5299
i7wkqu,"I’ve suspected things had been going on for a while, but kept brushing it off—I thought he would never do that to me. Since around April, he’s been refusing my attempts to have sex most of the time, sitting differently on the couch to where he’s facing away from me... little things.  It’s with one of our good friends. She came to my house a few weeks ago. She’s texted me. She’s pretended to be there for me.  I found out because I rolled over and they were having a Snapchat conversation. She said she wished she could be there to hold him and he summarized that I tried to seduce him last night and mocked it. I confronted him and he admitted it. He said that it was because quarantine was stressful. He does not want to work things out. He thinks of me “only as a friend in his heart.” When I told her husband, he confronted her and apparently they actually kissed back in February. I think at that moment, I was never going to be enough for him.  We used to be so so so happy. The week before they kissed, we celebrated Valentine’s Day together. He bought us a nice bottle of wine for our anniversary. We had fun, we were perfect.  I don’t know where to go from here. We’ve been married only about a year. I feel like he took so much from me and doesn’t even want to go to therapy or work this out. I don’t want to leave my house but everywhere in it I see him. He chose her. I’ve been cheated in every relationship I’ve ever been in. He was supposed to be my forever.  I don’t know what to do. I’ve made therapy appointments but I was also laid off last month, so I have too much free time to analyze every single moment where he might have been lying to me or where I made myself pathetic trying to cling to him.  How do I start to get through this? TLDR; My husband had an affair and does not want to try to work out our marriage. I feel like I’m drowning and don’t know how to start moving on.","You can't go to therapy and work this out. It only gets worked out if both people want to put the effort in, and your husband has made it very clear he's not interested in trying to make the relationship work. He directly told you that. You need to find a lawyer and file for divorce.",1667
i8jgfi,"Link to previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8efmq2/my_22f_former_roommate_30m_is_freaking_me_out/ No one asked for an update, but I thought I'd provide a short one. **TL;DR: I never have to see John again in my entire life. David and I broke up. I moved away and cut off contact with everyone. Also, turns out I'm gay. Life is good now.** Shortly after this post, David and I had a sit-down talk in which I said I was no longer comfortable going over to his place. I showed him this post and how he was getting roasted in the comments. He agreed and started coming over to my place more. However, this became more lax with time and laziness and he started asking me to come over to his house, which I hesitatingly did. Basically, it backslid into how things were before, and he made no real effort to change anything. At no point did David consider moving out, and as far as I know, they're still roommates. It's been a while now, so I honestly can't remember if John ever made an attempt at making an apology, but at any rate he never made an apology I deemed to be genuine and he always made me uneasy. No more serious incidents occurred. John never touched me physically. For this, I feel exceedingly fortunate. A few months after I made that post, I started wanting to move away for various reasons (mostly wanting a change of scenery and culture), and I realized that I didn't consider my relationship valuable enough to make me want to stay. That was over a year ago. We broke up, I moved away, and in quarantine I've reconsidered my sexuality and am now dating a lovely, thoughtful, and supportive woman. My life is much better now and I see that that I was allowing myself to be treated in a very horrible and toxic way. I also see that everyone in that house was -- in a way -- gaslighting me into thinking that John's abuse wasn't so bad in an effort to not ""rock the boat"". No one, at any point, made any effort to stand up for me, including my supposed romantic partner (which, honestly, now disgusts me). I'm not in touch with anyone from that circle anymore and honestly, good riddance. I'm so relieved that I never have to see any of them again. Anyway, despite being in lockdown and living in a deep, existential anxiety, I'm very happy and life is drama-free (aside from the fact that I still have to come out to my family, lol). Thanks everyone for pushing me in the right direction. **EDIT:** I was not expecting this to blow up in the way that it has. ""David"", I know you have a reddit account, and if you're seeing this, I hope you're doing well. ""John"" is hella toxic. Good luck with everything. **EDIT 2: Seriously, this response is overwhelming. Thank you all so much for your support and well-wishes. I hope all of my future coming-outs go this well. <3**",I loved your tl;dr and thought you were making a joke. I'm glad your life is doing better.,1317
i8uxei,"Edit: I’m just now looking at reddit since I posted this and I did NOT expect this many replies, holy baloney. Thank you all for your kind words, encouragement, and tough love ❤️ also, I just realized my title is weird, (&amp;amp;) I think that’s because I’m on mobile and I copy/pasted the title from my previous post. Sorry about that!  [original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gq23vq/i_21_f_believe_my_boyfriend_32m_of_1_year_is/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)  My original post didn’t get a lot of interest but there were a few people who asked for an update and I really just need to vent.  The night that I made my original post, Rick called me to tell me he was going to visit his brother who lives in a nearby city (Jolene also lives in this city). As soon as he called I knew what was going to happen but I kept my mouth shut because I wanted concrete proof. He was sharing his location with me &amp;amp;amp; I watched (and took screenshots of) him drive directly to her house, and stay there for 2.5 hours. I even texted my sister who lives about 20 min away from Jolene about it, and she drove there and took a video of his truck in her driveway.  Needless to say I was absolutely pissed. I cried to my mom about it, then went to his house and packed up all my stuff &amp;amp;amp; brought it to my parents place. Not long after I got back to their house he called me to tell me he was headed home.  I asked him “so are you going to tell me the truth about where you were tonight?”  He acted oblivious, said “I was just at my brothers, what are you talking about?” When I said “okay, if you’re going to lie to me that’s all I need to know” he immediately started apologizing, saying he just went there for a visit, he just wanted to see her daughter, and he wasn’t trying to hide anything from me. My favourite part was “if you would have asked I would have told you, all you had to do is ask!”  Umm, I JUST asked you, and you lied to me??? So he asked if I would come and talk to him in person the next day.  This is where Dumb Bitch Me ™ comes into play.  I went the next day after work to talk to him. I asked him to be honest and tell me if he slept with her. He said no. We had a long conversation of him saying he fucked up but he didn’t want to lose me, etc. etc. At the end of it basically we decided to still be together, but that it was going to take a lot for him to regain my trust. My one condition for him was to not talk to her, and if she did talk to him, or visa versa, I needed to know about it. I told him if that makes me a psycho bitch then he should just break up with me. So for about 2 weeks we were still in a relationship but not spending near as much time together, saying I love you, or having sex. Basically it was like we “restarted”. HOWEVER during this time, she remained his best friend on Snapchat, and he continued to hide his phone from me. After two weeks I had gone to visit him, and we started talking about the situation. He was accusing me of cheating with someone to “get back at him” (with zero reason to believe this), saying he feels like he’s walking on eggshells and that I don’t trust him and he can’t trust me. I asked him what he wanted to do about it because at this point I was so done with putting in all the effort. He told me he wanted a break, and I told him I don’t do breaks. So we decided for a week we would just have some time to ourselves, but the rules of a relationship would still apply. I left to go back to work, and that week he went and stayed the night at her house 3 times. That week was so fucking hard for me, laying awake at night watching his location on my phone, knowing he was in bed with her. I barely wanted to exist, let alone go to work during the day. So that weekend, I went to see him again and broke it off for good. I decided on my drive there that I was going to keep it simple and not blow up at him, so all I said was “I don’t think we should be together anymore”. He hugged me, and his eyes got teary which was hard, but literally the next day him and Jolene were publicly dating, and still are. Now I’m dealing with the aftermath of them turning certain friends against me as well. I’m not sure what he says about me but I’ve already had a few people “unfriend” and “unfollow” me. I guess I just don’t understand how it’s not blatantly obvious to these people that he cheated on me but oh well. I wish I could tell everyone the whole story, and show them all the screenshots, so everyone would see what they really did but I know that’s not the right thing to do, and honestly it’s not the kind of person I am.  The hardest part of this all has been the overwhelming feeling that I’m not good enough. I have always struggled with my self esteem, but this has completely destroyed my confidence, and I feel utterly worthless. I can’t get past the thought that I was just a placeholder for him until she wanted him again.  TLDR: Rick went to see Jolene behind my back, I confronted him but we stayed together. He went and stayed the night at her house 3x so I broke up with him, now I am the bad guy and also Big Sad™",Those 'friends' who cut you out without hearing your side were never good people begin with.  Breakups are always hard but it does get easier and soon you'll find yourself stress-free from all the BS that came with having an idiot bf.  Spend this time to love yourself and realise how amazing you are.,2266
i909r5,"[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i76bqk/mom_thinks_our_relationship_could_be_better_im/) TL;DR: I wrote down what I wanted to say, including boundaries. She didn't blow up, but as predicted, she didn't take responsibility either. But I've now done everything I can and can move on. No one asked for this update, but I guess I wanted to give some of you ""told you so"" rights? I was able to use bits and pieces from almost every comment. From preparing myself for it to not go well/needing to hang up on her, to making sure I didn't fall into the trap of explaining/listing out past incidents. I basically said the following: ""I'm happy for \[list of accomplishments she's had\]. Unfortunately none of that erases 20+ years of lack of support and actions by you that clearly indicated I wasn't a priority. I'm not looking for explanations nor apologies. I've worked hard to make my peace with it, and I've worked hard to get our relationship to a point where I can maintain my mental health and have you in my life. So when you say it could be better, in my mind it's right where it needs to be. If that's to change at all, I have some boundaries that **need** to be followed: \[list of boundaries, some specific but two big ones of *Respect my boundaries* and *Respect when I say 'No'*\]. If you want us to talk more, I'm happy to pick up the phone. You have every right to ask things from me, but have to respect when the answer isn't what you want to hear."" First question was if I thought our relationship was better before my stepdad came around - No. Next was asking for examples when she didn't support me. I told her she'd have to do some reflecting because she was there for the same events I was, and it's not fair to me to ask for that emotional labor. She said she had done ""lots"" of reflection and couldn't see it ""until \[stepdad\] came into the picture"". She pushed a couple more times for examples. ""Is it because I missed some events *your dad* was at?"" She stopped when I called her out the second time for deflecting responsibility for her actions. I told her multiple times during this portion that she doesn't have to remember/own up to anything, but she does have to live with the consequences. Her last question was, ""Is there any way we could ever push past this all?"" I told her this is what ""past this all"" looks like. She pushed back a little bit, but when it was clear that I wasn't moving an inch, the call ended with ""Well, thank you. You've given me a lot to think about.""  None of her questions or responses were any indication she was worried that I was hurt. She was trying to find justifications I might listen to, anything to poke holes. There was part of me that wondered if she always recognized how much neglect there was and just didn't want to face it, but claiming ""lots"" of reflection and not having a single incident come to mind that didn't involve blaming someone else answered that question. While she was ""calm"" while she tried to respond, her tone was very tense. Worst case here she continues to try to push boundaries and I cut off contact and it's one less stress in life, best case she respects them and it's one less stress in my life (I know this is likely a case of she'll respect them until she doesn't). The important thing for me was that I was up front with her and set clear boundaries. I've done my due diligence to telling her how our relationship could ""change"" (I used ""change"" instead of ""improve"" very intentionally with my mother). I'm relieved. Ball's in her court and I have some answers. Thanks again for the advice, sharing of your own experiences, and encouragement. It gave me the confidence and a plan for that phone call. Edit: some typos Edit 2: I'm relatively new to posting on Reddit so forgive any etiquette missteps please. First, thank you to the kind strangers for the awards! My first. Second, thank you to everyone that commented. I'm both happy and saddened that I'm not alone. I appreciate the perspectives that everyone brought; it gave me some new things to consider. Third, thank you for the recommendations for groups, books, resources! I fully recognize this is just one step in a lot to finding peace and have some reading to do. Good luck to everyone who's going through something similar, whether it's family or friends. Stay strong!","I've had this same conversation with my dad. He knows there is something to repair, but he wants examples just so he can argue with me about them.  When he says things like this; ""She pushed a couple more times for examples. ""Is it because I missed some events your dad was at?"" I tell him ""that sounds like work you need to do in therapy. I can't help you work to an understanding of your actions when I'm the one that was impacted by them."" He won't go to therapy, but I refuse to conduct therapy with him.

ibfil4,"Hi, Original post was here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i2ymiq/saying\_i\_love\_you\_too\_soon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i2ymiq/saying_i_love_you_too_soon/)  Thought I'd drop a quick update as so many nice people gave advice. I was definitely over thinking things and suspect I was just being over worried due to his widower status (I've never really consciously associated that to him before I started reading some of the replies to my original post) Over the past few weeks I've stayed at his more often than not and things have been great. He hasn't said ""I love you"" yet but here's a list of things he has said/done that helped me realise not saying it doesn't mean he's not feeling it.... In no particular order: The little messages in the morning/evening on the rare occasions I didn't stay at his. Yup he's still thinking of me even when I'm not there. He ordered some toiletries for me on his weekly shop so I had some at his place too (After checking with me what I'd need) Plus I'm getting invited to join his ""meal planning"" discussions where everyone one in the house gets to pick at least 1 meal for the coming week (This is making me feel like part of the family and not just a guest) He's cleared out some drawer and wardrobe space in his bedroom so I can keep stuff at his too (this one was pretty huge to me) When his daughter asked ""Is Miss teacher going to live with us forever? his reply was a cheeky little smile and a ""Not yet"" - yup irrational or not the ""yet"" sent a few flutters off :D He's really open about everything. He's admitted to me that at one point in his life he really didn't believe that he'd be capable of love again (in a romantic way) but he knows now that's not true (Perhaps irrationally on my part - I really did read that as ""I love you"" Just in a, I really can't say it way)  He's arranged for his parents to have the kids this weekend so we can have a night away and a date or two because and I quote ""You deserve to be treated like a princess too sometimes and I don't want you to feel I only want you around for the children"" He's posted a few pictures on social media of us (with and without the children) my favourite being a selfie of all four of us snuggled on the sofa with the caption ""Star Wars night with the family - life is good""  After the previously mentioned Star Wars night, whilst we were being intimate I let slip another ""I love you"" in the heat of the moment and he replied ""I know"" which if you're a bit of a Star Wars fan (which we both are) is kind of the cool guys way of saying it. A little bit nerdy I know!  TLDR: An update on my last post. Partner still hasn't said ""I love you"" directly but I'm 99.9999999% sure that he does. And I've definitely not scared him off lol","I remember your original post, this is a very sweet update. Actions certainly speak louder than words and his actions seem to be saying that he loves you. I wish you two a happy future together!",1149
ih4r1x,"**\*\*EDIT: I shared an update (positive) in comments section, as 48 hours must elapse in order make a separate update post. Thank you all for the thoughtful and compassionate responses.** Backstory: I (32F) have been with fiance (34M) for several years. I've been in therapy since 21. I am admittedly a ""work in progress"" as I always will be, though I would like to think that I try as hard as I can and have developed some strategies to utilizes when things seem to be spiraling. This has allowed me to have a stable home life, relationship turned engagement, and I've always been able to hold down a decent job. My fiance does not have mental health issues, but often acknowledges that he wishes he was in therapy to deal with how he handles frustration and crisis situations. He has insurance, but can't seem to find the time to make an appointment for himself. He respects and is proud of me for going to therapy myself and when I become extremely anxious about situations (even about things related to our communication) he encourages me to talk about it (but not in a diminishing or gaslighting way). Prior to COVID, I (like most others) went to see a therapist in-person. Now it happens virtually, and I actually find it more effective for some reason. When I talk about really difficult subjects I'm processing, I tend to raise my voice and cry. Fiance and I live in a small apartment and it has happened so far that he has been out of the house during my sessions, so this issue hasn't yet come up. Today, fiance unexpectedly came home for lunch in the middle of a session. I knew that he'd come back at some point but wasn't sure exactly when. While on the phone w therapist, I was pretty viscerally upset and going off about some deeply-rooted, abuse related issues about family and ex. Fiance got home and walked towards my room to say hi and opened the door. He walked on me me speaking about something in abstract, and quickly left the room. He went into the living room and put on a podcast, maybe in an effort for me not to be worried that he was eavesdropping. So I figured he wasnt listening and continued to vent (about past resentment). Then But then I heard some shuffling outside my door in the hallway and when he coughed accidentally, it made clear how close he was. It was a super awkward situation all around and I'm not sure how I should have handled it. He then left the apartment and I'm not sure if I upset him. I'm also wondering if I messed up by not warning him in the morning that I would be in an appointment later. I had a million other work related things to do today on the forefront of my mind. I texted him that I'm sorry I missed him, and no response for an hour.  If I did in fact upset him, not sure how/if to apologize, so any advice would be appreciated. tldr; fiance came home unexpectedly, most likely overheard me venting about serious issues unrelated to him, left abruptly and I'm afraid I upset him","Why do you think you may have upset him? Your fiance knows you've went to therapy for years, regularly. He obviously realised you were in a session when he walked in. I don't think you did anything you need to apologize for, or anything that would've hurt your fiance.",3194
iijj64,"  # I posted this inR/Relationship_advice, but it got buried and I got only three replies so looking for advice here. TLDR at Bottom This will be a long post. I'm  finally at a point where I can't stand this anymore. I've been in love  with this woman for a very long time, maybe a couple of years at this  point and I'm not sure if I should just kill it or attempt to make  something with her. I met my  ex-wife, her sister, when I was 23-years-old and the relationship  developed very quickly and by 26 I had my son and daugther and had  gotten married. However, within months of being married my ex-wife had  an affair, but worse than that the man she cheated with had gotten her  into Heroin. After confronting her on this she said she was going to get  help, but instead she left in the night. I haven't heard from her in 4  years and last I've heard she's still with that guy and are homeless in  Las Vegas. Not sure how true that is, but being focused on holding it  together for the kids, I really don't have the time to chase her down,  nor do I want to after what she pulled. I  ended up getting a divorce in absentia. I did however maintain a very  positive relationship with my inlaws after the fact. Every other weekend  my kids stay over with their grandparents on that side and they pretty  much treat me like a son still, I still go to parties at Christmas and  am reasonably liked by the family. Nobody talks about my ex anymore  mainly to not worry my kids. My oldest, my son is very hurt by his  mother leaving. He's 9 now and I've had to get therapy for him after he  told me he hoped his mother was dead. She had been getting verbally  abusive toward the end which was when he was around 5 or 6 Anyhow,  in the year following my ex leaving, her sister and my her boyfriend  had started coming around a lot to see the kids. They knew I worked a  lot and would babysit and call it practice as they wanted to have  children of their own. My kids love them and were spoiled by them, which  I didn't mind because we all needed a little positivity. They got  married and were very in love. However, her husband was killed in a  workplace accident shortly after the birth of their daughter. It  has been extremely rough and painful for everyone involved as one can  imagine. I followed my Sil's example and began to take her daughter to  give her time to herself if things got too hard to deal with or she  needed alone time. She's been in grief counciling for a few years but  she still wears her ring and has told me she can't ever imagine dating  again. I talk to her about him frequently and she's gotten to a better  place but she's still very much in love with him, I can't imagine that  sort of pain. Over the last two  years we've been a more constant figure in each others lives. My kids  love their aunt and I have her over for dinner a couple times a week. My  daughter and her daughter have become close and love being around each  other so they have sleepovers. I've moved on from my ex by this but the  idea of dating possibly someone dangerous as their mother has kept me  out of the dating scene. I don't  know when it happened, but slowly I began to get soft on my SIL. She's a  great mom for what she's had happen to her. She's one of the sweetest  people I know and her sense of humor always leaves me laughing and  happy. Then I started realizing that I'm physically attracted to her.  I've always felt kind guilty about it because her late husband was a  good friend and since she's obviously is still grieving, so I've kept it  to myself. Since Covid started  we've been together a bit more because social distancing has had us lose  contact with most other people. Nothing romantic has ever been  discussed and I try not to flirt, but last week it was very late and  after the kids went to bed I made us a few drinks, not enough to get  drunk but she decided she'd rather spend the night, so I took my couch. I  woke up to breakfast this morning and the four of us felt like the sort  of family I've always wanted. She even kissed my forehead which is not  something she normally does. I still didn't say anything, but after she  left I found my son quietly playing with his toys in his room. He looked  upset so I asked him if he was alright. He  tells me point blank in the way only a kid can that he wishes Sil was  his mother. I sat down with him and asked him why he thought that way  and he gave a whole bunch of reasons her being nice to him, that she  never yells about anything. He likes seeing her at his grandparents and  she draws pictures with him, which I didn't know they did. By the end of  it my heart that is already melting for this woman even more wound up. When  visiting dropping them off with their grandparents, I tried to breach  the subject with her folks to kinda feel around how people would see. I  made a joke about she and I acting like a married couple sometimes and  they didn't laugh and were kind of stand offish, friendly but either  they know something or they disapprove. It's  getting too hard for me to ignore or pretend it's not getting to me.  I'm in love with her. Either I've got to kill it and find some way not  to think of her, or I have to find some sort of way to navigate through  this situation and tell her everything. If anybody out there has any  insight on how to approach a widow, especially one who was married to a  friend, with this sort of intention I could really use your help. TLDR-  Sil and I became close after my divorce to her sister and death of her  husband. She's great with my kids. I'm in love and don't know how to  proceed.","Some thoughts: 1.  Don’t make a joke of this to her.  She’s fragile enough that it’ll feel in turns both threatening and confusing for her.   2.  Clearly she’s happy with the arrangement you guys have, a sort of ersatz nuclear family which carries little emotional demands and high rewards for both of you ie your kids get the love and structure they need from two adults who care for them and each other sans the drama.  Not to mention each of you playing Mum and Dad creates that polarity which enhances a possible attraction. 3.  So I must ask this:  Are you absolutely sure you’re in love with her as a woman?  I mean, forget the convenience and comfort of it all- just her as an individual, would you have chosen her without all of this going on?  4.  I ask because as soon as the shock wears off, she’s going to wonder if it’s that or if there’s real substance to your feelings.  No one wants to feel like a stand in and it will confuse her in the sense that she’ll have to start questioning herself as to if this is something she wants in general ie dating again, if you’re what she wants or if you’re just convenient, all those feelings of disloyalty to her now gone husband will be A LOT of emotion for her to deal with. 5.  Which brings me to your expectations.  This is an “over the fullness of time” situation.  Unlike your ex, her former husband has now been idealized for perpetuity. He will never do any wrong, he will never be less to her, and he will always reign first in her heart.  A love halted before its time and shrouded in grief can become a safe space for someone - as at least she can always say, I was married once, I did have that once - and depending where she is in her grief, she may choose to stay there for a very long time and not go further.   Whereas you, whilst hurt by your ex’ betrayal, are probably thanking your lucky stars she peaced out - no one wants the chaos of addiction around their kids.  So your grief is different, you were left behind due to human flaw, and have been much too busy caring for your children. So while you share the state of being abandoned, each of your grief is personal and different.  You will forever be second to the man who’s gone before you and I hope you can accept that.   More to the point, you cannot launch this on her and expect a simple yes or no.  That’s irresponsible. If you want to prove to her that you are the man she believes you are, you’re going to have to think steps ahead. 6.  That means, you need to start getting more personal time with her without the pressure of a proposal to be romantic with each other.  Declaring it poses an unnecessary immediacy when I don’t see a need - neither of you are rushing to date other people. You need time alone with her just to hang out and talk without the kids always around you.  Don’t ask her out formally, just carefully position yourself by getting time together like maybe stopping by and dropping off her fave coffee.   There’s obviously some danger here of being friend zoned but the trick to that is not to allow her to treat you like a gf.  Just short bursts of personal time with intentional acts of attention, like if it’s Mother’s Day get her flowers, then joke “I know you’re not my Mum, but I’m so impressed by how you are with the kids that I just had to get you this.”  If that extends to a deeper conversation, say something like, “you being how you are makes me really think of who I should have in my life”.   Always leave it a bit short on details to give her a chance to pursue it or leave it.  Then the next time just give her flowers for no reason.  Now she will either suss that this is getting romantic and will show you if she’s uncomfortable with it, OR she’s going to start looking at you and going hmmmm.  7.  Here’s why I suggest this:  like it or not, you guys are actually good for your kids together.  And the potential of losing that just because she’s not where you are romantically, or worse, she may react negatively out of panic, is well - not really something you want.  8.  I agree with ppl saying don’t run it by your in laws.  It’s not their concern right now and it may even be a non starter.  Who knows right?  9.  As more time passes you’ll be able to tell if she’s more open or not, and that’s when you go full court press.  Even if she turns you down, you’ve gained enough information about her and how she feels about being romantically involved that you’ll likely be able to talk about your options together more comfortably.   10.  Obviously, follow all caution not to be neutered in her eyes.  A lot of that you can help by keeping the polarity electric, meaning do things that keep each of you in that state of awareness of your maleness vs her femaleness.  I sound like a douche but I don’t know how else to put it.   But here’s an ex.  I know when a guy’s interested in me if he mentions how much he makes or does something overtly manly.  Once I was on holiday in the Seychelles and the very married son of the pensione owner took one look at me and decided he would fling his shirt off and chop wood right in front of my breakfast window.  I was literally a captive audience.  I wasn’t going to pursue it by any stretch, but it was his version of hey babe.  Like seriously he went through an entire tree trunk, it was amusing and flattering. I wish you luck OP, I get where you’re coming from and I don’t think this is impossible.  I just think you have to be very careful to see things from her perspective and walk that fine line between gentle and exciting. PS if this works I’ll expect an invite to the wedding.",1658

So cheers for all the advice and all that stuff. I spoke to my mum's and told them I was thinking about not skateboarding again. They told me that's good because they're not letting me. There were a few suggestions that I ask them to come watch me. When I floated the idea, it was shot down immediately.  I went to my doctor and she told me that she doesn't want me skateboarding again. She expanded on my condition after the accident to me and told me another fall like that isn't going to go well for me. She said even after I get this thing off, I'm going to need to go to therapy to build strength again.  My mum gave my board to charity after we talked about it. I know they sound kinda mean, but they're really good mums. They're just very annoyed I did something very stupid. My girlfriend is annoyed me with me as well when she heard I heard I wanted to skate again. So overall I'm not skating anymore.  TL;DR: I'm not skating anymore.","Your mums don't sound mean, they sound like they love you. You're smart for listening to your doctor, it must really suck to not be able to skate if you love it but it's not worth the risk, especially since you're still healing. We all feel a bit invincible at 15 but don't push it, a lifetime in a wheelchair or worse isn't worth it. You sound like a sensible young man with great parents. I hope your recovery is swift and your strength returns.",1514
j267bi,"Almost all the marriages in my family have been arranged marriages. My mum’s marriage to my bio dad was an arranged marriage but it ended up in a messy divorce and him completely abandoning us before I was even born. My mum had a love marriage the second time, despite the disapproval of her family, and has been much happier with my stepdad than she probably would have ever been with my bio dad. Because of this, my mum has always been very adamant that she would not try to force us (my siblings and I) into arranged marriages despite what the rest of our family thought. I’ve been with my fiancé (26M) for 3 years now, we got engaged 2 months ago. He’s met my parents and siblings but as far as the majority of my extended family were concerned, I was single until 2 months ago. Early last year, my fiancé dropped me off home after work one day and my uncle was there. My uncle is the oldest sibling my mum has so he’s seen as the ‘head’ of the family (i.e. he thinks he has a say in what the rest of us do). It was obvious my uncle was pissed, and he ended up grilling my fiancé and I assume he met his standards (a lot of arranged marriages are about what both families can gain from one another (e.g. wealth, influence, etc.)) so he told my mum to get us married quickly (he wanted to make it look like we had an arranged marriage before the rest of our family found out). My mum ignored him and told us to keep dating if it’s what we wanted. Over the past year, he’s mentioned me getting married to my mum every single time he’s spoken to her. Apparently, my uncle assumed just because he’d given the ‘order’ that we were going to get married soon. He told my cousin (his daughter) that I had agreed to an arranged marriage and because I had and she was older, she should agree to the match he’d found her. My cousin never mentioned this to me, but she did agree to marry the man my uncle found for her. They got married late last year. They haven’t had a good marriage and my cousin is very unhappy. Her husband is incredibly controlling and hardly ever lets her go anywhere without him or a member of his family. Last week, she was over at my house when my fiancé came over to drop some of the clothes I’d left at his place over. When I told my family about my engagement, they all assumed it was an arranged marriage and I didn’t bother clarifying because it really isn’t anyone’s business. You don’t tend to do sleepovers if you’re having an arranged marriage, so my cousin knew immediately it wasn’t what she assumed. She started asking me questions about my relationship and I answered honestly. She got really angry at me and kept demanding to know why I didn’t tell her about him. The thing is, I’m very close to this cousin but I also know how our family is about dating and I didn’t want my male cousins trying to strongarm my fiancé (they’ve jokingly threatened this before). She pretty much blamed me for her arranged marriage and said she only agreed because she thought I was going to have one too and if I had told her I had a boyfriend, she would have had the courage to stand up to her family. She hasn’t spoken to me since. I do feel bad for her. I know how unhappy she is but if she had mentioned what my uncle told her earlier, I would have clarified. I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but I don’t know what I can do to fix this. Please help. TL;DR – My cousin agreed to an arranged marriage because she thought I was also going to have one. She’s since realised I’m having a love marriage and is blaming me for letting her agree to an arranged marriage when I had no intentions of having one myself.",She's blaming you because it's safer than blaming the person who is really responsible here.,4438
j2hohg,"In 2013 after an exceptionally bad breakup and graduating from college, I moved to a New City and basically started my life over. After a few weeks of subletting, I found a roommate on Craigslist named Kasie (30F) who I hit it off with immediately. I've always been more of a 'boyfriend girl' in that I was with my ex from tenth grade until college graduation and he was basically my 'best friend' so Kasie was my first real girl BFF. We lived together for four years until Kasie moved in with her boyfriend Jason (32M) and we had the best time. We almost never fought and spent all of our time at home together. We are both incidentally from the same home state, have a lot of similar interests and personalities and complement each other in lots of ways. I get along super well with Jason too and they never made me feel like a third wheel. I have a larger friend group now in New City and (thankfully) lots of girl friends but Kasie is still my bff and we talk/text constantly, hang out weekly, etc. The problem: Annie (30F). Annie is Kasie's best friend. They've been best friends since their early 20s and are kind of a package deal. Annie is very cool and smart and funny and she and I are  good friends too and there's no competition between us or anything. She and I even hang out without Kasie sometimes. I can't stress enough that we all get along and that this isn't like the movie 'Bridesmaids' or anything! But... sometimes I feel really sad that Kasie is MY best friend, but Annie is hers. Kasie will refer to me as 'one of her best friends' but we all know that Annie is #1. If Kasie ever says something like, 'You're my favorite!' to Jason he laughs and says, ""No, that's Annie.' If Kasie and Jason get married, Annie will be maid of honor, no question. Everyone kind of says 'Kasie-and-Annie' like they're one entity. They have very big and beautiful matching tattoos (though Kasie and I have matching tattoos too, but imagine it being something like a 1 inch potato because we're both from Idaho, whereas Kasie and Annie have gorgeous tattoos that cover most of their upper arm). I don't know how to get over this sadness. It feels really childish. Kasie doesn't ever make me feel left out and neither does Annie. I love them both. But I guess I'm just jealous that I'm not anyone's 'favorite' in the same way. It feels extra childish of me because I have a boyfriend and I know I'm his favorite, but I guess I just never got to experience having a girl BFF who also considered me her BFF like that. How can I be satisfied with being almost-the-best and not the best? --- TL;DR: My best friend, Kasie, has her own best friend, Annie. How can I get over feeling like I'm second best?","To quote the Mindy Project, ""best friend is not a person, it's a tier"". I have friends going back to middle school, who I would rate as best friends, but for all I know many of them have other ""best friends"". In fact, I know my cousin who is among my ""best friends"" will rate her childhood friend and her closest work friend among her other best friends.  Now, I don't know how to shift your perspective to that direction but I think it can be helpful to recognize you are one of her best friends, just not *the* one and only, because she clearly has more history with Annie. In the same way that my cousin's work friend can't ever have the same intimate connection due to history that me and cousin share, I can't share the connection they have because of their unique professional experiences and physical proximity (they live next door, I live in a different city). Our friendships are different but equal in a way? It may also help to cherish and think about your other close friendships. Maybe you will find some people who can join your ""tier"".",3465
j9skka,"  Here's the link to my original post here : [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j7ftmw/boyfriend_has_stopped_being_romantic_completely/)    But the TL:DR : Boyfriend (18M) has completely stopped flirting with me(18F) and I'm not sure if I'm being needy while he's at school and how I should approach him about the issue. I just want to say thank you to the original people who commented and reached out to me, I was very emotional at the time and needed some sense talked into me. That day I made the post, I was supposed to hang out with my friend and her friends, so I had sat down with them and asked for advice. They basically said the same thing everyone here did and I guess seeing their in-person reaction to me explaining everything that had happened made it click that something was really wrong. After getting over my fears of me being right, I asked him if he still wanted to be with me. While he didn't say no, he said he enjoyed his newfound independence from school and not having to worry about anyone else. This confirmed what I already knew and I knew he wouldn't directly say he didn't want to be with me anymore, but I still got my answer in a way. While I'm hurt, I think I had already grieved the relationship during it, since I spent a lot of time crying and wondering what had happened between us. At least now I can move on instead of holding onto every small sign that he might still like me. I wish he could have just been up front sooner, and just told me he didn't want a relationship when I kept trying to flirt or be romantic instead of just ignoring those moments, as it just left me confused, and I wish I could have avoided this completely but I suppose it's a lesson learned. I deserve someone who's going to reciprocate my feelings and affection, so I'm excited to see what happens now. Thank you guys for the kind words and advice.","This will be a huge weight lifted from your heart before you know it. Being direct is so important and saves so much pain in the long run, even if the experience isn’t pleasant (aka is devastatingly sad) when it’s happening. You’re better off and you’ll be just fine. Be gentle with yourself and focus on self-care and having talks with friends or finding little distractions.",1705
jcwxd4,"Just the title sounds creepy... Me and my bf have been together for only six months but have been friends for about a year longer than that. We only ever hung out with a friend group and did dnd together and stuff, and I fell in love with him without really hanging out at his house or interacting with his kids. I knew he HAD kids (m7, f12), and he'd talk about them, but I didn't meet them until I was already in love with him. Some background: I came from an abusive household. Both of my parents were emotionally/psychologically abusive and my father was an angry drunk who threw things and punched walls. I've been in therapy for it throughout my life (when I can afford a therapist, yay USA) but am currently not. I've never really hung out around a healthy family with kids in it? I'm estranged from my extended family since cutting off my parents, and most of my friends either don't have kids or they're very small babies. The first time I went over to my boyfriend's house, his kid was acting up and I felt my whole body go tight waiting for him to get angry/aggressive with the child... and he didn't. He was kind and gentle. I was absolutely just... I'd never seen that. The more we spend time together and the more I see him around his two kids... I keep having these sort of earth-shaking revelations like... This is what parents are supposed to do. This is what it's supposed to look like. My therapists had explained, verbally, what it's supposed to be like, but that's very different from actually SEEING a parent who genuinely loves his kids and treats them well. I love spending time over there because when he is kind and gentle to his kids, I like... passively absorb it, is the only way I can think to explain it. I feel safe and warm and protected in an extremely just, primal way? That I never felt in my own house or anything. To be clear, I know what daddy kink/DDLG is... and this isn't it. It's not sexual at all. I just see the way he takes care of his kids and wish that I could just ... duck under that umbrella and be cared for like that too? One time he was telling me about the custody battle he went through with his ex-wife, who didn't want him around the kids, and how hard he fought to stay in their life and I just started crying. He was comforting and I tried to explain that no adult in my life would have ever fought for me like that. I told him ""I wish I'd had a dad like you"" and he said ""I wish you did too."" Which was very sweet but I just worry this isn't something I'm supposed to want from my boyfriend, or feel for him...? He knows about my parents and we've talked about it a few times. He gets it because he didn't have a great upbringing either. It's probably not okay to cross wires like that... I believe in communication in relationships so I probably need to talk to him about it. But how do I tell him so it doesn't come off creepy? There's just so much positivity and warmth and unconditional love in his house and I want to just... wrap up in it like a warm blanket. But it's not mine... it's his kids'. And I probably shouldn't get the wires crossed like that? I don't know. If I hadn't had to change jobs during covid I'd talk to a therapist again but financially that's just not an option right now. TL;DR - Raised in an abusive household, now see how my amazing boyfriend loves his kids and I wish he'd take care of me/love me the same way, since nobody ever did. Is that wrong? Do I talk to him about it? EDIT: Wow so many comments. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I'm definitely googling a lot of the ideas and books and things everyone mentioned. I didn't expect so many people to relate to this. It's kind of sad and really.. heartwarming? I was worried I was messed up and that I should shove these feelings away and felt guilty for feeling like that, but a lot of you suggested it's just love. Healthy love, and it's okay to want that. Which feels like it should probably be obvious. I've decided not to make a big deal out of it or have any kind of Talk about it, but just keep telling him how much I appreciate him and the things I see in him. Thank you all again for so many comments and advice and ideas!","I don't think you want him to be your dad, you just want to be treated with the empathy and respect he treats his children. So tell him how you feel, just don't say ""I want you to be my dad."" That'll probably spook him, but beyond that yeah tell him you've never seen a parent treat their kids right like that and it makes it feel amazing to be around him. And how much you want more of that. I'm sure he'll feel flattered for basically being called an awesome dad, and then he'll feel able to become more emotionally close to you.",7066
jet6a7,"TL:DR GF wouldn't talk to me after some unfortunate events that happened that resulted in her officially breaking up with me this past weekend (OCT 17) Here is the original post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j9z5di/my\_34m\_gf\_26f\_of\_6\_months\_wont\_talk\_to\_me\_over\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j9z5di/my_34m_gf_26f_of_6_months_wont_talk_to_me_over_an/) No one asked for the update, but I would like to say some things. Well, I was finally able to see her over the weekend for my and someone else's bday celebration, it wasn't a formal bday party, just hanging a friend's house during the day and going out later on. She basically ignored me at the friend's house and when I tried to get a minute to talk to her about what was going on, she wouldn't spare a few minutes to let me say my peace. But she did tell me she was pretty much done after the initial birthday incident a few weeks ago even though she kept telling me she didn't know how she felt or what she wanted yet. It's been a few days and the rose colored glasses are beginning to come off. I still think about her and want to be with her but it's getting better by the day. I've also started to try to remember certain things that bugged me about her in an attempt to help me move on because I've always had an issue with only remembering the good. Thank you all for you insights and advice, it helped me come to terms with the fact that she overreacted and wanted out anyway and this was just a good enough reason. &#x200B; Edit:  Wow! So many people have wished me luck and brought up some thoughts I've had as well. Thank you all so much for your insights and ideas.  Anytime I find myself thinking about/missing her, I will come back and read these comments to push me through.  Oh yeah, and thank you for the awards as well! &#x200B; Edit #2:  Somebody asked in the comments what hobby she was trying to get into.  I play tennis recreationally and I'm not sure if she was trying to get better at it for me, but she mentioned it several times that she would like for us to go and play together.  She even got one of our friends who also plays tennis, to take her out and show her some drills she could use to help improve her game.  She texted me last night saying she had some things to say and clearly I do so could we call and talk sometime, I said sure just let me know.",You're right OP...her reaction is so wildly illogical that I dont think she ever really was that into you. She probably was already teetering over an indecisive line and found a reason to say she isn't interested. Don't take it personal. You did nothing wrong,2302

Hi everyone. I posted this almost two months ago, this is been the worst year of my life (with most people I’d imagine lol) and these past two months have been hard too. I just wanted to update and say I broke up with him yesterday. After having a month of space from him i realise that I can’t be in a relationship where I feel like nothing I do is good enough, bc I’m just not good enough for him and I never will be. Idk if anyone would ever be good enough for him tbh. The thought of being single is really scary, and I do feel empty and I do think i’ll always live him, but for my sake i think it’s for the best it ended. Being without him is better than constantly feeling bad for just existing, i think. Honestly, the scariest thing is before I posted I didn’t even think anything was particularly wrong about our relationship. And I thought if it was it was my fault bc it couldn’t be his.  So I just wanted to thank the people of this subreddit for waking me up. I was in denial at first but you guys were right. I’m so thankful for everyone who helped me.  Stay safe everyone  <3",Thanks for the update. So glad you have recognized that you deserve to be treated with respect even though being single is scary. Take time to be proud of yourself for making the hard choice.,878

Well, it’s over. As many of you suggested, I couldn’t possibly build my life around someone who lied so pathologically.  I initially agreed to work on the relationship provided that my ex get therapy to work through why he felt compelled to lie about so many aspects of his “life”. I also requested that he come clean to his parents, my parents, and anyone else he lied to or embellished the truth to. He agreed to this and seemed genuinely interested in working on things and himself. I really wanted it to work out and was willing to accept that maybe he was just wildly insecure/had some attachment issues or something that caused him to act this way. I waited 4 months for the therapy and confessions to happen and they never did, not surprisingly. For those of you who were confused about how I didn’t know he did not own this apartment for so long/thought I had never met his parents - I had met them many, many times. But tbh they are pretty cold people who I never really connected with that much and was definitely not comfortable enough to be like “hey, is your son a pathological liar or is all of this true?”. On top of that, he also told a lot of these lies to his parents as well so they wouldn’t have been keen to what I was talking about anyway. It got to the point where basically anything that came out of his mouth seemed like a lie or at least a half-truth to me. Also, I lost respect for someone who could lie so easily and then not even feel guilty enough or any remorse to come clean about it. I’m pretty honest, almost to a fault. So the cognitive dissonance there that occurred from being with someone who had basically opposite values from me was tough. I’m sure there were a lot of other things he was hiding, but I don’t even care. I’ve been single and living alone for a week and to be frank I’m killin it. Im now responsible for 100% of my rent and I barely have any savings left, but I still feel like a giant weight has lifted off my shoulders. Crazy how that works.  I want to thank all of the people who gave me the hard truth straight up and encouraged me to leave. Even though it was all coming from internet strangers, it still helps to hear people tell you that you deserve more than what you’re getting. I’m so happy and I must be giving off a much better vibe because I’ve already had 2 dates and been asked for my number a handful of times (I’m a server at a restaurant lol). I sound like a cocky asshole but god does it feel good to remember you’re not as worthless as someone made you feel.  Thanks Reddit, and if any of you are in a relationship with someone who is like this - GTFO and don’t look back.","Wow, sounds like you got out of a terrible situation. I wonder how much of his parents coldness towards you was because of stories he was making up about you to get sympathy or money out of them.  Enjoy your new life!",2085
jqezuc,"My husband and I met in college. His family were nice whilst we were dating but did a 180 when they found out my husband was planning to propose. They tried to convince him not to and threatened to disinherit him/financially cut him off (they never went through with the latter) if he did. He’d warned me that his family were elitist when we met, so I wasn’t that shocked by their reaction. In the end, he proposed and cut them off completely. They tried apologising before our wedding, but my husband refused to talk to them and wouldn’t invite them. Fast forward to now we’ve been married for over two years and his sister reached out to me over Facebook. She said she’d been trying to contact my husband for a week, but he wouldn’t respond to her or any of their family and she didn’t want to deliver the news in a message. She asked me to ask him to call her. I mentioned it to my husband, and he said he wasn’t going to do it, and that this was another one of their games to try and get him to contact them. I relayed the message to my SIL, and she ended up telling me that their grandfather was very sick, and he was desperate to see my husband again. Their family is worried he isn’t going to make it. I tried to tell my husband this but he’s adamant that they’re lying despite his sister having sent me pictures as proof (he refuses to look at them). His parents have both called me to apologise for how they behaved again and are begging me to convince my husband to see reason. My husband’s grandfather is the person he was closest to and I know if he passes away without them making up, my husband won’t be able to live with himself. I know he’s still hurt by how his family reacted, but I think he’s letting that cloud his judgement. How do I make him see that they’re not lying when he’s in so much denial? TL;DR – My husband’s family were unhappy about him proposing to me and tried to force him not to. He ended up cutting them off and he’s continued to stay NC despite them apologising and reaching out several times over the years. Now his grandfather is sick, and he thinks they’re lying despite sending us proof and is adamant about continuing to ignore them.","You can't force your husband to get back in touch with his family, and if you try it's likely to cause problems between the two of you as well.  You can say, once, ""I know you're still hurt by the way they treated you and us, but I worry that you're going to regret it if you don't see your grandfather before he passes away and I don't want to see you hurt even more by this. I totally support whatever you decide to do, but this is the evidence that he's sick, and I believe your sister when she says that he probably doesn't have much time left. Please think about it, and let me know if you need to talk."" Then leave him alone. He knows his family better than you, it's possible that they really are using this crisis to try to bring him back in, where the control tactics and manipulation will start again. Trust your husband to know what he needs.",5155
jv9s89,"My parents died when I was younger so my uncle raised me, mostly on his own. When I was younger he was engaged to a woman but that was about it. Obviously for a long time I didn’t think about it as a kid but when I got older I started thinking he might be gay. There’s also this guy “John.” I don’t know him that well but like he’s visited us 1-2 times a year over the years even though we live on the opposite coast. We’ll usually hang out all three of us like at a movie or my uncle will get tickets for something, but he and John will spend time together too. There’s just this weird vibe between them. Sometimes I don’t know why they’re friends because they don’t like laugh or talk about the good old days with each other, my uncle is kind of uptight around him. They just seem to talk alone a lot. I’ve also noticed that when we see my grandparents my uncle will never be like “oh my friend John is spending the weekend with us.” And this is really embarrassing but John does this thing where he sends out a little email newsletter to my grandparents and older relatives with like pictures and updates, but I’ve noticed John is never mentioned there either. The other day I had his phone for something and I noticed a ton of messages between him and John, I didn’t see anything but the last few texts but just noticed the conversation was really large. But then he saw me looking and took his phone back and didn’t say anything. I knew he knew I’d seen it so I said something like “Oh it’s cool that you talk, how do you know each other again” and he gave me a vague answer. And I’ve been thinking about it since that happened and realized I don’t even know that much about John. I think he might have a daughter and he’s like showed me some of his hobbies but I don’t know anything about like his life or how he knows my uncle. And like it's weird for him to fly 3k miles multiple times per year to visit in-person, right? Would it be weird to say something to my uncle? I feel bad and even though we live in a liberal area, our family is semi-religious with lots of older relatives. I feel like I want him to know that I support him specifically. Because sometimes people say they’re fine with LGBTQ people but then they don’t really mean it. And I know it’s his choice but it also kind of bugs me that he doesn’t feel like he can share his own life with me, I’m 17 not 7. **TL;DR: I think my uncle might be gay. Should I talk to him about it?**","It seems to me that even if your uncle is gay, which IMO is pretty likely but far from certain, that would only be only one aspect of the true answer to the question of “what’s the deal with your uncle and John?” Don’t take this the wrong way, but my gut feeling is that if he hasn’t explained whatever is going on with the two of them yet, there’s probably some aspect to it that would be hard to understand for someone who hasn’t experienced adult life, and I would urge you not to push him on it.  Having said that, it would probably be a good idea to make a point of being supportive of the LBGTQ community to show that you wouldn’t react negatively if someone in your life came out to you.",2171

I was asking for advice if this meant she may be interested in something romantic or if she may just like saunas (being German and all where nudity often isn't such a big deal). **Update:** After trying to gather my courage over the weekend to ask her out, she told me on Monday that she has matched with someone on a dating app and was very excited to meet them and talked quite a bit about them the whole week  I think she either never intended to indicate any romantic interest or realized over the weekend that her invitation could have been seen as something flirty, so she decided to tell me about her love life - to set the record dtraight so to speak. In either case, it seems not to have meant anything. Regardless: Thanks a lot for the advice, it could have very well meant something else! \------------------------------------------------- TDLR; My coworker invited my to a mixed sauna after the lockdown is over but it seems to have been meant as something innocent as she talked a lot this week about meeting a match on a datung app.",Oh dear Germans for some reason love sauna and when someone says they have never been it's quite common to offer it.,2250

I took the advice and broke up and realised that the relationship was really sucking the life out of me and was the worst thing in my life at the moment. Since then I have met someone who understands me and cares for me, theres no drama (Well I once ate the last pizza slice and she got pretty angry but yeah thats the level of the drama). We support each other and she makes me a better human all around. Because of my ex i wasn't able to focus on my studies and the breakup combined with the Covid Pandemic gave me ample time for studying and I landed an internship at a big Bulge Bracket company and also Im working on a few personal projects that I love spending time on. The pandemic also gave me time to realise that I was with the wrong person and I love many others who love me be it my family, friends,etc. I feel really liberated. Today I was looking back at what used to be and I remembered that this subreddit for the trigger point for the change in my life. SO THANK YOU AND YOU ALL ARE AWESOME. Its because of you Ive gone from Crying nights to Happy days. Edit 1: Some edits based on comments. Edit 2: HOLY SMOKES! I didnt expect such a reaction. Thanks Guys. Edit 3: Such Wholesome Comments, Thanks Guys.

kjm5pf,"We've been dating for 3 weeks. Too early to know exactly where it's going, but so far he's been openly enthusiastic. I haven't felt this nervous in years! Obviously I know he's not perfect and I'm keeping an eye on that side of things too, as it's easy to get swept away. He's very attractive, well spoken, well-read, open about his interest but not over doing it. Fantastic kisser. We're in the same industry and have similar life plans. Lots in common as far as interests. Hell, even similar ugly-duckling stories. He's been super respectful anytime I mention a boundary of sorts. I have a few as my last long-term relationship was quite abusive. Luckily my ex has been out of my life for 2 years. FWIW - I haven't mentioned my ex yet, just vague things like ""oh do you mind not surprising me from behind? I'm a bit jumpy."" This isn't my first time dating since my ex and I have plenty of  (positive!) dating experiences from before him too. I really shouldn't feel so... Almost starstruck. **I just feel like a teenager again. Half the time I don't know what to say I'm so flustered. How do I get my nervousness under control and just enjoy the moment?** If this doesn't work out I'll be fine - I'm not so worried about my heart so much as trying to act like myself and less struck on dates!  TL;DR: Met an awesome guy. Obviously trying to keep my head, but how to I stop losing my thoughts and wit while we're talking? Edit: Wow I was not expecting so many responses! Thanks all - it's great hearing stories of folks in similar situations, as well as some tips and tricks I can use to stay appropriately excited. Really appreciate the kindness shown! Edit 2: I should have phrased it like I'm not used to being so attracted to someone. I'm quite confident in myself and his interest! But that doesn't help me when he does something very goofy and charming and I'm a bit lost in how attractive he is. The limerence is strong haha. All the same the answers have been super lovely and encouraging!","Stop overthinking. He’s in to you. Be you. If he doesn’t like what that looks like, well it wasn’t going to go anywhere.",2108

After trying to talk to my friend through October and the beginning of November I finally threw in the towel when he started being a dick on the 1st anniversary of my father's death. I kicked him out of my place and have had zero contact since. While it hurt to cut off a friendship that had lasted as long as ours did ultimately I think it's for the best. It's been 26 days since my last drink and I'm feeling more confident every day. I've discovered other friends that have been quietly supporting me and realized they were better friends than my now former roommate. Tl;dr: Kicked my former best friend out of my condo and out of my life. Found life to be slowly improving due to that decision,"It’s amazing how much more clearly we see things when we don’t have someone clouding our vision.  In your case, you held your loyalty to your best friend above all, and then you were crushed to find out he’s not who you thought he was.  I’m sure if you reflect on your relationship with him, you’ll see other things you let slide that you probably shouldn’t have. The cheating thing was your proverbial line in the sand.  Chalk it up to experience. It wasn’t all bad. The relationship served you for that time, in the way you needed. It wasn’t a failure.  Keep Moving forward, and finding new friends. You’ll be amazed at how many good people are in the world that you haven’t even met yet.",330
kmiu1k,"Recently my wife and I went on a vacation for two weeks. We're lucky that in our country, COVID has been kept at bay, so travelling within the country is pretty easy. My dad lives in our apartment.  He doesn't pay rent. While we were away, he continued living there. Upon our return, the place had pretty much been trashed. There were fast food wrappers all over the floor, in the living room and bedrooms. Dirty shirts (several of them mine) being washed in the kitchen sink. Toilets in the bathrooms clogged up. One of the windows was left open during a rainstorm, letting rainwater in. Open condiment jars and cold cuts left out. Moldy food on the stove. A dozen half-finished coffees everywhere. Laundry just thrown on the floor in the living room. Appliances that were working perfectly fine before we left broken. He is actually in good shape mentally, but he's just always been a slob. This isn't the first time he's abused our space. He refuses to live by my rules, even though the house is in my name. A while back, he allowed his friends to use our home as a meeting place. When one of them started trying to recruit people for a MLM, I said that the party was over and that I wanted everyone off my property.  I called the cops and unfortunately in the heat of the moment, I lost my temper in front of them by saying if f the cops didn't remove them from my property, I would do so with force.  My dad then got upset with me because I had ""disrespected"" his friends and made him look bad. I talked to my wife about it, and while she acknowledges that my dad is a slob and a hoarder, she doesn't want to kick him out because he gave us money towards the home for our wedding.  She said that if something happened to him it would weigh on her conscience if she sided with me in asking him to leave. TL;DR - Dad trashed my apartment and I want him to leave.  Wife said she feels bad about asking him to leave because dad gave us some money to buy the house and because of the risk of something happening to him.","Things that arent signs of a slob: leaving windows open for days  during a rain storm, washing clothes in the sink and leaving them there, leaving out sandwich making stuff for days, clogging multiple toilets in a short time frame and leaving them(he is forgetting to flush and just reusing the same water without flushing), thinking MLMers are your friends. He needs to be evaluated for dementia. Edit: these are all signs of starting a task, forgetting what you are doing, and abandoning it.",6368
kqkj9c,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i7wkqu/i_30f_caught_my_husband_31m_in_an_affair_and_i/ First of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better.  I had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them.  While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing.  I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel.  It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle.  Therapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything.  So all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more.  TLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.","Yay!!!!!!!! Congrats!!! There's nothing like living alone in your own, perfect space, amirite??",4544
ktz21o,"My (21m) mom (61F) keeps texting my friends and girlfriend. It’s always been annoying and overbearing but it’s crossed a line. She almost texts some of my friends more than I do. She has never met most of them nor my girlfriend. I met my gf around a year ago. My mom asked for her number (for “emergencies”, but I knew what would happen). I said no as she and I weren’t dating yet and had really only been talking for 3 or so weeks. My mom proceeded to check my recent followers on Instagram and ask around among them to figure out who she was. Once she figured it out she began texting her. I don’t want this. She has also continued to talk to  some of my closer friends she had messaged. My gf and I have hit the 9 months of dating now and my moms texting of her had ramped up considerably. She almost texts GF more than I do. Mom is overbearing and has began complaining to her and talking about me (little embarrassing childhood moments). I hate it. I told her to stop and she said “at least I won’t be an awful mother in law”. If she keeps going like this she may not get to be a mother in law. She does this same thing with the friends to a lesser degree (some are now very awkward around me as they weren’t close before but this has pushed them away). I’m terrified she will do the same for my gf.  She won’t stop. She even emailed my college professor to check up on my grade (I’m doing well in classes but it wasn’t her place to do so (the prof shut her down and alerted me)).  I recently went on a backpacking trip (my phone was without signal) with one of my best friends and she took this as the opportunity to go back and FB message my astranged Highschool Friends to try to arrange days for them to see me and her. I haven’t talked to many of these people in years. I got back and got mad and she said “your friends are my friends too”.  She has done stuff like this since early HS but I wasn’t in a place to stop it nor was it as persistent and aggressive as it is now.  I can’t have any accounts public nor tell her who I see but this makes her cast her net wider.  I can’t do this any more. I don’t want to lose my family over this shit but I need freedom and the ability to have my own life.  TLDR; My mom won’t stop texting my gf nor friends no matter what I do. It’s causing serious difficulty with my relationships.","Wow! I am 55 yr old mom of a 21 year old son who lives/studies overseas. I cringed when reading this. Cant blame covid. She has been doing it for years. I would NEVER, EVER contact my son's friends or gf outside of an emergency. He would never put up with it either. She has to be told that this will ruin your relationship and is destroying your friendships.   Have one zoom session together with the therapist and you could both explain this situation and that should put an end to it immediately. No therapist would condone app behaviour.

kue9rm,"We've been married for 3 years and been together for 7. He is an avid gamer however its getting ridiculous now. I absolutely understand his need to game, it's his downtime and I would never ask him to stop altogether. However we haven't gone to bed together in over 2 years, he stays up till 3/4am every night gaming. I can't get any sleep, it's a small house so all I can hear is the clicking of the mechanical keyboard and him talking to the others online. He'll sleep till 12/1pm on the weekends, he games for most of the day and night, thinks spending an hour or 2 with me after I make dinner is 'quality time' (it really isn't). I've tried talking to him about this but it always escalates into a fight and he says that he'll be living a miserable life if he has to limit his gaming time.  I'm stuck doing all of the household chores while working full time and running my own business (a bakery). I love alone time as much as the next person but I feel so lonely as we can't do anything together because his world revolves around it. I have tried every approach and he won't budge. He turns it around on me saying that I'm being controlling, needy and that I'm changing him which I'm absolutely not, I have never asked him to stop and would never. He does work so I understand the need to escape and have time alone. Any advice is much appreciated. TL;DR Husbad games all night, refuses to see it may be a problem in our marriage","I read a similar story on here a few years ago and the girlfriend/wife had good success with asking her husband to just track his hours, everything he did. Then rank his priorities in life and compare how he spent his time to his priorities. He would *tell her* she was his priority but she was able to demonstrate that is not where he was prioritizing his time. IDK. My husband went through a phase where gaming was a problem, but it was that, and directly related to his mental health.  Aside from making it extremely clear that he is prioritizing a digital life over his irl wife and that you are being negatively affected by his gaming and are not going to stick around for that forever or subject kids/dogs whatever to it. And that playing an hour or two at night and a couple hours on the weekend are fine but what he's doing is unhealthy for everyone including himself, there's not much you can do. It really is similar to dealing with an addict. You have to decide what **your** boundaries are and stick to them. ETA: also. You are not obligated to try to fix him or try to solve this problem. This is a problem of his creation. If he does nothing and you leave you should not feel guilty. **You deserve to be treated well in a relationship, and not expected to sit on a shelf until your partner is ready to play with you. You are a whole person with needs and wants and it is a good thing to know that and fight for it**",4318
kyqjar,"This is a throw away for anonymity. For 25 years I have been in a marriage that has always been rocky. 12 plus years ago I was going to leave, told my family etc. Only to believe him when he said he would try. Of course things were better for a while...at some point I decided to stick it out until my kids were grown because I was afraid that having them in a visitation arrangement would be mentally damaging to them. That's his big issue, he is verbally abusive and controlling. I'm an independent, successful person and I am also  financially independent. I  have been able to keep him ""in check"" so to speak in regard to the kids most of the time because I simply won't tolerate his attempts to control them. That's not to say he has not habitually made our oldest feel less than or like he is a disappointment. Both of our kids are well adjusted, bright, motivated and loving. But, if they don't measure up in some way, his reaction is unbelievably harsh. He says hurtful things to the kids and they have both, at times, broken down crying about his treatment of them. All he cares about is ""his money"" and doesn't even want to help our kids with college. There's more, I could go on but, the question is, do I try counseling? My concern is that it's just a ploy to pull me back in. I begged him for years to go and he refused.

kz6fpy," My dad recently moved his partner in without asking me or my siblings if it was ok. This has created a lot of awkwardness for us, and my 2 younger siblings keep telling me they are uncomfortable living with her because it’s like having a stranger in our house. I feel the same way. I don’t really know how to cope so I’ve just not really talked to her beyond saying hi and good night and how was your day to her.  Recently, my dad has asked me why I haven’t talked to her more and I told him that I’m not that outgoing or talkative with strangers. He said that she wasn’t a stranger and I said she felt like one. I asked why it wasn’t ok for me to just coexist with her in the house and to just only exchange small pleasantries, and he got angry at me and said I needed to make her feel welcome.  I just don’t know how. She seems nice, but I’ve been feeling depressed about not seeing my friends, and so I’m tired and run-down a lot. I have a bad relationship with my mom, too, so I’m wary of older women and women who are in a position to be maternal. Tl;dr: I’m looking for advice on how to deal with my dad’s girlfriend moving in.","Honestly? Sounds like you were doing fine.  Be polite. Be pleasant. Maybe periodically try to engage with her.  It’s not on you, the kid, to develop a relationship with this older adult. And if you aren’t there yet, that’s fine.  Maybe ask your dad why this is such an issue for them.

kzmpla,"My husbands parents have a ton of money. I don't know the exact amount but I would guess just based on their buying and selling of property its somewhere in the 8-15 million range. My husband seemingly has always resented that he came from a rich background, he is a VERY do-it-yourself kind of guy and dislikes handouts. Even before the pandemic, his parents always offered to help us out with stuff and he always refused. We would argue about it but it was never that big of a deal because we were both financially stable. To him, this is a super sensitive topic, one which he wont even entertain. He always tells me to just act as if his parents have nothing.  &#x200B; Last year, my son developed some medical issues. I'm not gonna go over them, its not deadly, but he does need expensive treatment and eventually likely surgery. I took off from work to watch him, which put a major dent in our finances. Fast forward to 4 months ago, and my husband lost his job. The past 4 months have seen us arguing non stop about finances. His parents have PLEADED with him non-stop to help us out, and he refuses. He would rather everybody suffer, and he is like, 110% deadset on fixing this situation himself. He is COMPLETELY confident that he will fix all of these issues on his own, that he will find a job or start a business that will save us. Meanwhile, medical bills have piled on, our mortgage payments are late, and we have effectively burnt through our savings. We quite simply cannot keep going like this.  &#x200B; I mostly manage our finances. I think that, oddly enough, him growing up in a rich home and also getting a good job right out of college means that he doesn't entirely comprehend the kind of situation we are barreling towards, so even while he likes to sort of reject the benefits of having rich parents, in a way it also means he is blind to what it means to not be rich. Even while we are headed into debt, we haven't changed our lifestyles that much (we were frugal before this). The only difference has been debt piling up.  &#x200B; I am not looking for financial advice. I am looking for a way to get my husband to accept his parents money. We have been looking everywhere for a job for him, and as of right now with unemployment through the roof and his industry especially having been destroyed, we have no prospects in the near future. There isn't much of a solution except his parents helping us out. How in gods name do I get him to accept the money? For me? For his KID who has medical issues which cost a fortune?  &#x200B; TL;DR - - How do I get my husband to accept the money his parents are offering us? We are in debt and both unemployed and our kid has health issues, and he is refusing to take their offer.","You mange the finances. Sit him down and show him the bills. Ask him what his solution is. Since you manage the finances, I feel you get the final say. Some solutions I can think off: 1. The money is strictly for your kid. Maybe that way he can put down his pride 2. Consider a loan instead of a gift. 3. Get a job from his parents. I assume his parents have some work that need his help. He doesn't sound like a bad person, just too prideful and refusing to accept reality.",4143

I really started to wonder if it might be PMDD. When she was calm, I talked to her about her mood swings. She agreed that it was a problem but didn't have a clue what to do about it. So, things stayed mostly the same. Now, I was also struggling (still am) after the death of my father. At a routine check-up with my doctor, I told her about my symptoms of depression. She agreed that it sounded concerning and got me an emergency referral to the psychiatrist (these are the only kind of referrals the hospital was accepting due to covid). In the meantime I got started on anti-depressants. Seeing how easy that was, I went to my wife and brought up my concerns again. This time I was able to tell her what to do and what might happen. It turns out that she has GAD, the pms was only exacerbating it. However, this really didn't excuse her behaviour around the funeral. Some comments pointed how my emotional needs weren't being met. That was a pretty big understatement. I was in huge denial around that time. I felt like I could do nothing for my wife. Or for anyone. Life just felt like endless suffering. I ended up attempting to do a lot of bad stuff to myself. When I finally was contacted by the psychiatrist, I explained my situation. It was casual for a bit, but then I told him what I'd been doing and.... Well. He told me to admit myself to the hospital or he'd send someone to get me. My wife was in complete shock when I told her what was happening. But she brought me there. When she first saw me again, she apologized for how distant and awful she'd been. I didn't even bring it up, but she apologized about the funeral. The 8 hour trip had really stressed her out, and she'd been incredibly anxious about the funeral, covid, baby planning, etc. But she told me that none of that was an excuse. The time apart really gave her time to think. She got me everything I needed. She visited tons, and there were hours of time to talk feelings. She worked with my doctors on safety plans, got me a bunch of welcome home gifts, and she has been a lot more helpful around the house. The medication she's on has really leveled her out. She's very happy to be on it too and says she doesn't feel crazy anymore. She's continued to be amazing. Usually I'm the one that does most of the christmas stuff, and usually I give all the best gifts. She's always struggled to get me things I like, but this year she actually outdid me. I have so many switch games now. Guys. I haven't gotten to them all yet. I'm still having a rough go, but she's always telling me to not stress and focus on recovery. I'm really happy to have her. ETA: We aren't currently baby planning. We were trying right before my father passed but that's now on hold for the foreseeable future. **tl;dr** My wife has GAD and I have severe depression. we're both being treated and things are a lot better.","Having a baby was like a nuclear bomb to my mental health. It ruined years of therapy and treatment to get my mind to a healthy place. And for two years after having a baby, I was an anxious mess. It took a lot of medication, exercise and work to get myself almost to the good mental health I had prior to having a baby. And I just have anxiety/ADHD/seasonal affective disorder.  Definitely save up a fund so you can afford the amount of babysitting or nannying you might need if you do have kids.",1133

The entire time he was begging for another chance and promising “this time would be different” (eye-roll) he was still sleeping with the affair partner and telling him he loved her and would do anything to make it work with her. It didn’t even hurt me to find it out. I was THAT unsurprised. It just helped me stop feeling guilty. I divorced his ass.

Shortly after my original post I met someone by chance at a wedding and fell in love. This person is everything my ex husband was not. The kindness, compassion, and respect they show not just me, but to my daughter as well, is like something from a dream. I never knew love could be so easy.  To anyone in a loveless marriage reading this-LEAVE. Do the hard thing- ESPECIALLY if they have a pattern of leaving/returning/cheating, etc. Lord knows I was terrified to cut the cord. At one point in time I was actually starting to feel bad for the guy because he was begging me every single day for another chance. He tried to convince me that getting a divorce would ruin my future, our daughters future, that she would come from a “broken family”- but it was the exact opposite. It was broken already and I fixed it. Once I made up my mind that divorce was the best option, I absolutely thrived. I learned independence. I found how to be happy on my own. I found happiness in a partner. Life has never been so sweet. The bad shit makes the good shit so much better. Thank you, Reddit, for the support on my original post. It helped turn my graveyard into a garden.  TL;DR: I divorced him and found true happiness.",My husband feels he’s entitled to another chance with me.  Narrator: “He isn’t”.,4018

I remember exactly how confused and mentally exhausted I was at that point. Reading the responses and having my feelings validated by a bunch of internet strangers gave me the confidence to know I wasn’t being too sensitive (f that). It also got me out of a constant state of rumination about what was happening to me and why I felt so off and not myself and led me to act. I told him I wanted space and that if we were both trying our best and our relationship felt like this we had a huge problem. I also told him that at some point he had stopped treating me like his girlfriend and started treating me like a defective human being and I was over it and wouldn’t continue to invest my time and energy into someone who treated me this way.  Those first few days I spent alone were like an f-ing vacation. I couldn’t believe how amazing it felt to do simple, every day things without his constant interference and judgement. At the same time,  I did start to notice some of the things I was blaming him for being critical of me were really areas I was insecure and being critical of myself. I spent more time over the next few months investing in myself and and improving certain areas of my life. Our relationship seemed to improve slightly over the next few months. The micromanaging and criticism really improved or I thought they improved. He might have just changed tactics. I think he started triangulating and upping the ante with the “innocent” insults. I think I had also gotten better at dealing with it and probably lowered the bar even more. In the fall I had my first ever sciatica flare up. It was agonizing pain almost constantly. It lasted 8 weeks and I was trying everything - physical therapy, anti inflammatories, bio freeze, ice, not moving, powering through the pain. He was over it all after a few weeks and starting treating me like I was a lazy slob. I felt so scared and helpless about how much pain I was in and if It was ever going to get better or would I need surgery. The added stress of still trying to be a good partner was horrible.  I’m not sure why this instance of his selfishness had more impact, but I felt something change inside of me in a profound way. Of course when I tried to talk to him about it, it went very poorly. The argument ended when he mocked me for crying and asked me why I couldn’t talk to him like a normal person . I can’t remember when it started but I began to have physical responses during any kind of conflict with him. Sort of like fight or flight maybe? My hands start shaking, I start feeling overwhelmed and confused, my stomach is flipping, and eventually the tears come. This comment from my original post rings true: “It seriously sounds like a low key gateway to emotional abuse. I can't imagine his BS only starts and stops at just hacking away at OPs self worth and then gaslighting her about what's happening. Those people get worse as the relationship goes on, not better.” The BS certainly didn’t stop there. There were so many instances during our relationship where I felt he had lied to me. There were constant interactions where my instincts told me he was being inauthentic or he was hiding something or not giving me all the details. The addictions. The attention he gave women on social media. Always needing someone to blame. An almost embarrassing inability to take accountability. I still feel pretty conflicted about what I did. I went through his phone. I started by looking for a couple specific times in the beginning of our relationship where my mind had flagged something as off or a lie but I had no idea why. Like when he insisted we go drop a bottle of champagne off to a friend of his as a congratulations for getting a new job. At the time I couldn’t place what felt off about this. I looked at texts from this specific date and now I know that we were really there to deliver cocaine. When I was able to confirm what my instincts told me were lies it was off to the races. It was all pretty bad. He was on tinder for the first 6 months we were together, bumble for 9, and plenty of fish 11. All texts with other women deleted. Secret drug use. It’s hard to even remember everything but I tried to just confirm what I had felt to be lies.  There is definitely a ton of anger and sadness but more than anything else I felt relief. Everything my instincts have been telling me since the beginning have been accurate and I have been fighting a losing battle against them. It felt freeing.  Why have I continued this relationship in spite my instincts for 2.5 years and endless stress and chaos? My hair has been thinning since the 3 month mark in our relationship. I’ve had brain fog and memory problems despite being known for my iron trap memory. Sleeping issues. Weight fluctuations. My body has been physically rejecting this relationship. Somehow I either couldn’t admit that it was him or I was really that out of it. I’m starting to try and unwind it all in therapy.  I have had 3 sessions so far and am scheduled weekly for the foreseeable future. What I have learned so far is I was taught to not trust my feelings as a child by my Dad, who is very likely a narcissist. I’m really excited to work on my toxic patterns and behaviors in therapy and make the relationship I have with myself better and my priority. We have been living in separate bedrooms for a couple weeks. The initial confrontation was horrible and I hurled some really rough insults and names at him. A few weeks ago I was thinking that I would have a final discussion about why we were breaking up and the logistics of him moving out etc. It still almost felt like I was going to have to convince him that this was a good enough reason to break up.  After a deadline for work is over in the next couple days I’m going to tell him the relationship is over because I want it to be. And I do. I’m going to offer to pay for movers so I have an exact date he will be gone. I am nervous about his reaction and scared of what he might say to hurt me but I have never been more certain I’m making the right decision  so I know I’ll be able to handle whatever happens. Again, thank you endlessly to anyone who took the time to comment on my original post or reached out. I felt seen and heard that day in a way that woke me up and nudged me to really start paying attention and stop turning everything inward.  TL;DR I wasn’t being too sensitive; we are incompatible. He was not only making my life a living hell with all the criticism, gaslighting, and passive aggressive jabs, he was also a liar and a cheater. Coming to terms with all of it and working on myself in therapy. Oh and one more thing - In my original post I played dumb about what he was insinuating when commenting about the shorts with the wet waistband. I was so paranoid at that time I wanted to see if other people came to the same conclusion that I had. When I reread my post that stuck out to me as sad.","My best friend's husband snapped one night and brutally murdered her and her unborn child. We don't know why but I think she told him she was done as he was abusive. Do not be alone with this man when you break up with him.

let91g,"Hi guys, I just wanted to thank you all for your love, advice, and support regarding my last post. I woke up yesterday morning and told my boyfriend that either we’re going to have a serious adult conversation about the future right now, or you can pick a time later today. After a bit of back and forth, he picked 5pm. At 5, we sat down on the couch and discussed each of our goals regarding marriage, children, employment, etc. We also discussed concerns that each of us had, I started out with mine and then I think that helped him voice his concerns, the largest of which involved my family (they are complicated). I think me forcing the scheduling of a time to talk helped him open up about his concerns. No, I don’t have a ring on my finger yet, but my goal was to get him to open up about why he didn’t want to discuss it. We ended up talking for about 2 hours and I made clear my timeline requirements and he agreed. I feel like we’re in a good place now. Thanks again for all the love and support ❤️ TL;DR finally got my boyfriend to talk to me about the future and I feel good about it.

I never threatened to break up with him. I told him what I needed from him and we talked through a lot of questions and concerns(from both sides). It wasn’t a one-way conversation like you all seem to have assumed. Thank you to everyone for your continued support! I hope those of you who feel like relationship issues can never be resolved find happiness in your own lives ❤️ EDIT #2: For everyone saying that my ""timeline requirements"" sound controlling, you must not be women who want to have children. Sorry, but I'd like to have kids and unfortunately my clock is ticking; I think wanting to be married by the time I'm 30 is pretty reasonable. For everyone saying he's just telling me what I want to hear and will keep pushing me off, I understand your concern, but the conversation we had leads me to believe otherwise. I know that sounds fishy, but without relaying word for word what was said, I don't really know to explain it. Again, thank you all for your comments! You're really helping me think through everything from every angle.","This is what I started to do with my husband, we would pick a day and a time for when we were going to discuss important topic or decisions.

lq5de8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7awaf0/my_best_friend_22f_is_giving_up_a_fullride/ Just found this throwaway account and thought I should give an update! My friend and I are now 25, and we’re still close. She did transfer schools and lose her scholarship. She also graduated late because of the transfer. In all, it cost her more than $30k in student loans, which she regrets. Things did not work out between her and her boyfriend. He really wanted to live a party boy lifestyle with her at home to cook and clean up after him. They broke up one year after she transferred. She still had a semester left, which was really difficult and lonely because she had no friends aside from him and his social circle. After graduation, she got a job as a teacher in her hometown. So she does have a way to pay back the loans! She’s pretty happy. She’s now engaged to a different guy she started dating ~2 years ago. They got together right after she moved home. Yes, it’s fast, but they live together with no issues. They aren’t going to start planning a wedding until COVID eases up. She’s less gullible now and more skeptical of her mom’s advice. Her experience really opened her eyes to the consequences of her choices. TL;DR My friend learned an expensive lesson, but her life turned out okay. She ended up where she probably would have if she didn’t transfer, but $30k in a hole. She’ll be the first to tell you to prioritize your future over a short-term relationship!","My college roommate did the same thing with a full ride for grad school—star crossed reconnection with a hometown guy and everything!!

His roommate went away for the weekend (Valentine’s Day weekend!) and it fell on us to take care of the dog. I, obviously, was not too excited to be having to schedule my Valentine’s Day weekend around this dog’s needs, but was willing to do so to have a weekend alone with my boyfriend. Well, much to my surprise, the dog is a total sweetheart! When her owner is not around, she barely raises her voice, sleeps most of the day, and is extremely easy to care for! It would appear that it is really stuff like the incessant baby talking that *actually* bothers me, not the dog itself. Through observation, as well, I’ve realized that the dog only barks and whines because she knows she’ll get attention or food *from her owner* whenever she wants. My boyfriend has very cleverly trained the dog to know that that doesn’t work on anyone else. So no begging from us! So now I ignore the roommate’s dealings with the dog, love the dog herself, and let my boyfriend’s roommate deal with the worst parts of owning an old dog and just enjoy a buddy to watch tv with when shes not around. Win win! Thank you everyone for all the great advice. TL/DR: Dog doesn’t suck! Roommate still sucks at raising the dog but its much easier to ignore now because the dog is so great!","That's a great update OP, thanks! Glad you made a new friend!",1394
lrcym1,"The front page r/askreddit thread inspired me to follow up here. [Here's my original post from five years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fnzui/me_35_m_with_my_sister_42_f_siblings_for_35_years/). The discussion was really helpful, and at one point I had my therapist read that thread. Thanks to everyone who chimed in.  Since that post, I have not been in contact with my sister, except for incidentally at a few family events, where we had minimal interaction. My other family is conflicted, but they seem to understand that neither of us wants to be in each others' lives any more, despite them wanting us both in theirs. I've worked on this issue specifically in therapy, which has helped me develop some insight into those messages. Next year I will be as old as my sister was when she wrote me those abusive messages (there were a few followup messages I didn't include in the original post.) I don't regret cutting her out. I do regret having had a toxic person for a sibling. Looking back I recognized that her over the top email was part of a few lifelong behavioral patterns. I realized that basically, despite our biological similarities and having been raised in the same household, we are simply not compatible people. I hope one day she will develop her own insight, recognize her abusive behavior patterns, and reach out to try to repair or reestablish a relationship with me. But I'm not holding my breath for this to happen, and I'm not interested in reaching out to ask her if she'll consider trying to improve things. Not having her in my life in the years since has actually improved the quality of my life: there's been a lot of unnecessary drama and hard feelings that I'd been used to having to handle that I simply don't with her gone. At this point I anticipate only seeing her at a few more funerals. Would have been nice to have a good relationship with a sibling, but I do not have that with her and I don't believe I ever will. **tl;dr**: Cut abusive person out and life has improved EDIT: I am humbled by your responses.

I know it's been almost 2 weeks since my last post. Some of y'all offered some great advice...again, thank you. So here's what happened since my last post.  I went back to work the next day and Jack was off...it was blissful. I didn't see him the rest of the week because he went back to Montana to see some family. I only knew his whereabouts because another coworker felt the need to inform me...  Anywho, Jack gets back that weekend and on Monday he runs into me as we clock in. Immediately he begins to describe Montana...his sister was getting married in a small wedding...the colors...the flowers. I express my congratulations to his sister and start heading to my department. We don't see each other until lunch break. I'm sitting down enjoying my leftovers when Jack comes over and starts in on what he has in mind for my wedding, even so far as mentioning price brackets. I put up my hand and tell him to stop. I tell him that my fiancé and I are doing a courthouse wedding, it may not be romantic in his eyes, but it's what we want to do and what we are looking forward to doing. I also told him that he needs to drop the subject as we are not changing our minds. He starts apologizing and saying that he didn't realize that I was serious about the courthouse. I just shook my head and told Jack again to stop talking about it before I walked away from him. Yesterday I heard from another coworker that Jack was upset and didn't mean to cross lines with me. At this point I don't care. I said my piece and am super happy that I stood my ground. I will keep doing this too because it feels good to not be a doormat. I should've done this sooner! Thank you again.  **tl;dr**: Jack went on vacation, came back, and started his usual spiel. I stood my ground and it felt pretty damn good.","in my early 20s i really became aware that i had a problem with confrontation (never wanted to insult anyone, always tried to get out of uncomfortable positions by making a joke out of it etc.) and i promised myself that the next time i found myself in that position i would put my foot down no matter how unsettling it felt. i can't even remember now what the 'next situation' was, but i followed thru with my promise to myself and the RUSH of adrenalin i got from doing that convinced me to never go back to the way i was. i still falter sometimes, but for the most part i've gotten really good at standing firm. it's a great feeling. i'm happy you did it as well! congrats on your now stress free wedding!",1050

m1ak1z," Sorry for any errors, I’m writing this on mobile.      So my sister has never been one for good hygiene. She didn’t take brushing her teeth seriously until she got two cavities and to this day refuses to brush her tongue so her breath smells bad (I sometimes get on to her about it but she’ll lie and say she did). She’s never really taken care of herself because my mom has always babied her.        Anyway, her bad habits have extended to her room. One of our dogs like to stay in her room, and because of that it will poop and pee on the pee pads we had to start placing. One of her only chores was to pick up the waste and keep her room clean, but she doesn’t. She will literally leave the poop there for days and rarely changes the pee pads, and it’s to the point where I have to go in daily now to do it. Not only that but she never cleans her mattress (we tried to once together and brown stuff kept coming off the mattress but it’s still not clean) and rarely washes her sheets. Because of all this and more, she smells terrible and I can’t stand the smell of her room (our rooms are right next to each other too so when my door is opened I can smell it).         I have a really sensitive nose and some sensory issues so the stench always sends me into a sensory overload episode and I can’t really stand to be around her anymore. I try to tell her that she needs to wash her sheets and keep her room clean, but she just does the whole “no you” routine because she thinks I’m teasing her.         I don’t know what to do. I’m going to college in a few months so I won’t be able to pick up after her and I don’t want this to keep going into her adult life. Does anyone have any advice on how to get her to listen to me seriously? TL;DR: My sister smells really bad because she doesn’t clean her room up and takes any advice from me as if I’m teasing her. I don’t know how to get her to listen. Edit: I want to clarify that the dog is a chihuahua and her room isn’t like covered in poop or anything. It’s just that there are small areas where the dog will poop and she’ll just ignore it while she does something else. Also, she usually smells fine after she takes a bath, the problem usually rises when she gets out of her room in the morning until she bathes again (because we generally stay in the living room and hang out in the evenings so she doesn’t really go back in there).","“I’m going to college in a few months so I won’t be able to pick up after her and I don’t want this to keep going into her adult life.” I think you have partially answered your own question here. Your parents don’t seem too concerned about holding her accountable and she doesn’t seem too concerned about getting better.  I’m not one for giving absolute advice most of the time, but to me it seems like the only solution here is accepting that it’s not your job to parent or fix her, nor are you able to. Let it go and go to college. She will grow up, or not, on her own time. But sheltering her and trying to fix her problems for her isn’t going to do anything but shield her from the consequences of her lack of hygiene.  You’re going to meet plenty of people in your life who you will feel the need to fix, and often they will be people you deeply care for and don’t want anything bad to happen to. But this is a dangerous path to follow for yourself. Learning when to let others help themselves is a vital skill to learn in order to not end up in codependent or abusive relationships.  So the takeaway here is you can only help your sister and yourself by not helping. Easier said than done, but it’s possible.",3041
m3l3uh,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/k9c84u/my_27f_boyfriend_28m_is_obsessed_with_my_ex_27m/) After my last post, I tried to take the advice in the comments and suggested couples counselling and I asked my boyfriend to cut off my ex, but he got angry at me again. He claimed I was the one who needed therapy because I had jealousy issues, and that my ex was one of his good buddies and I couldn’t dictate who he was friends with.  Then a week later he had another hangout with my ex and his friends where he proceeded to very loudly tell them how I was so insecure, and I was trying to tell him who he could speak to. My ex and Luke had to tell him to stop which he didn’t like at all. I should’ve just broken up with him at this point, but I was stupid and still clinging to the hope of my boyfriend going back to how he was. After this happened, my boyfriend was constantly making jabs at my ex and Luke but then he would still contact them and pretend to be friends with them.  Then, he became super interested in what my sex life was like with my ex. He was constantly asking me who was better between the two of them and he would ask me if I had done this or that with my ex. I kept telling him I didn’t want to talk about it and to stop asking me. I then find out from my ex and Luke that he had been asking my ex directly the same questions and that he had been bragging about our sex life to his friends. My ex said he was telling me because my boyfriend made a comment about loaning me to my ex if he ever felt like recreating old times. That was the final straw for me, and I broke up with him and moved out.  My now ex-boyfriend didn’t take the breakup well and he went on a smear campaign. He even contacted my family and my ex’s family to tell them we were apparently having an affair and that he had no choice but to break up with me. It’s been almost a month since we broke up and he keeps getting new numbers to text and call me. Deep down I think I knew this would be how things ended. I’m sad about the relationship I thought we had ending but now that I’ve had space away from my ex-boyfriend, I feel much better and it's like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. TL;DR – My boyfriend wasn’t willing to work on the relationship and he kept doing things to embarrass/upset me so I finally broke up with him.",This dude is nuts.

A couple of the replies were a little harsh, but looking back that is exactly what I needed to hear. I broke up with my fiance almost 2 weeks ago, and when we sat down to talk, she was still adamant that what her sister did was the right thing and didn't care that it hurt my family.  She didn't apologize, showed no remorse or any sort of sign that she would be willing to work with me on this.  This left me with no choice but to break up with her. The first couple days were quiet, a lot of crying and sleeping in different rooms, no argueing or fighting. Then she went to stay at a friend's house 2 days later, and that is when things got bad. She would purposely come back to the house only when I wasn't there, and bring her sister with her.  Took a few more things from the house than we agreed upon, and her sister decided my couch was a great place to change a dirty diaper for her baby, including leaving a leaking dirty diaper on the couch for me to find.   Then the next few days started a smear campaign on social media and lies told to friends.  Myself, Ive stayed quiet on the social media regarding the breakup and keeping my distance trying to let things cool down.   I have now blocked my now ex fiance on every platform, including emails as it was nothing but her trying to drag me into an arguement that would go no where. TL;DR  Fiance wouldn't talk it out, we broke up, she showed her true colors. I dodged a bullet. Thank you kind redditors that helped me see the light. I had a hunch that things weren't all that great, but I needed someone stranger's to tell me to pull my head out of my ass. EDIT- Thank you for the silver, awards, and kind words. After reading all these comments, I feel much better about everything. I appreciate it very much.","So sorry you have to experience this, just focus on how lucky you really are to have dodged that bullet. Damn, she would have been an entitled nightmare of a wife. Good for you. I hope your sister doesn't feel guilty about it, i would worry that it might happen.",1794
m5uznm,"  Up until about March 2020, my family was fine, my parents were divorced on very good terms (had been for 9 years) But right as the covid restriction began, my dad pretty much began losing it. In turn, this really screwed up my 18 year old brother, who turned to drinking. This is how things were for a while, until about august, when my brother got a dui. Wrecking a car my dad had just bought him. And my dad isn't rich by any means. He's unemployed, with virtually no money. At this point my dad went virtually insane. Then, my dog, and cat died. Not exactly helping. Then, in december my dad finally decided to go to an impatient facility, he came out two weeks later, feeling good. For about a week. He went back a month later. Same deal, felt good a week, went back. And now we're here. He came out, same thing. But now, he's totally estranged. He told my mom ""I loathe you, fuck you."" and won't give her back the $6000 he owes her. So my mom is also financially fucked up now. My brother is in constant conflict with my mom, and my mom is crying almost everyday. I just don't know what to do, I'm mind bogglingly stressed everyday and can't focus on anything.  tl;dr: family coming apart, dad resents mom for no reason, 18 yo brother picking up drinking","The best way to support your family is to support yourself. It sounds selfish, but if you spiral with your family, you won't be able to do anything to help at all. You are under so much pressure, but you are not alone. You can get through this. What can you do to take care of yourself? Would staying with friends or other family help you feel safer? Are you open to speaking with a therapist? Would finding a support group where you can speak with people in similar situations help? Even starting just by opening up to a teacher you trust or a school counselor who can help you find the resources you need could be an excellent first step. But please do what you need to do to keep yourself safe and sane. We love you so much.",2206

Thank you for the support and I took a lot of your guy’s advice I’m very grateful.  So my (m22) and my boyfriend (m22) did get a call from Harry (m22) apologizing to us. He specifically called me but requested my boyfriend (WHO SIDENOTE IS NOW MY FIANCÉ SO I AM A VERY HAPPY MAN anyways :)) ) also be at the phone with me.  So Harry when on this speech about how he knows he was in the wrong and that he wants to repair a friendship with both of us. This was about two days after I made the original post. And suddenly he claimed he no longer had feelings for my fiancé. Yeah right. Of course neither of us believed him and honestly his apology was kind of shit.  I realized through the comments that he wasn’t a true friend and through more self evaluation that for awhile he was using me to get close to my fiancé. That realization hurt a lot and it definitely set back my development of getting over my social anxiety.  I told Harry I didn’t want to repair are friendship. That I Had realized he was using me. And that he definitely wasn’t over my fiancé just after two days. When he claimed to be in love with him for over a year. I told him how he blatantly tried to take away the love of my life and how much that deeply hurt me.  Harry didn’t take this well and exploded. He started cussing me out. Saying how he honestly could care less about my feelings.  How I was never a very good friend. How I have a tendency to push people away (again that’s why it hurt so much losing him and feeling betrayed because I already have a difficult time keeping friends in the first place cause it’s hard not to push people away) He told me he only stayed my friend for the past few months to try to get in my fiancé’s pants. Accused my fiancé of seducing him (honestly hilarious because my fiancé has a hard time flirting with ME because he gets so shy. Adorable though) he also claimed that I cheated on my fiancé with his ex boyfriend (definitely not true) at that point he was just trying to convince my fiancé to break up with me again over the phone. I hung up and blocked him after giving him a few harsh words.  So it’s been a few days since then. My fiancé and I joined a book club as one of the commenters suggested since he and I both take interest in books. And things are looking up. He introduced me to some people he knew that I shared a major with and it’s nice to have people that like what I like. And I’m starting to put myself out there more with the help of my fiancé.  And i proposed clearly. The whole thing kind of made me realize how much I loved him and I was already planning on proposing anyways. We had gone to a place that was special to us from when we were teenagers and we hadn’t been in about four years. So I proposed there. And he said yes. And now I’m very happy and could honestly care less about Harry.  Thanks to everyone who commented :) much love.  TLDR: Harry called to apologize and I told him I accept. His facade disappeared snd he cussed me out. He never wanted to be my friend. Just wanted my boyfriend who I’m now engaged to. Things are looking up and I feel overall happier.,Congratulations both on your engagement and your losing a non-friend weight off your back.,1673

He said he understands that he should have told me, but that he had kind of hoped that she was just having a weird moment and that it wouldn't happen again and we'd avoid the entire thing completely.  I told him that from now on I want him to be upfront with me about this kind of thing. I also told him that if he was worried about if I'm going to believe him over my ""friend"" or not he shouldn't be. Because I honestly suspected that she was into him anyway, I would have definitely believed him.  Anyway, I feel like he totally understood where I'm coming from. If anything this whole thing kinda made us be in on the same page about this type of stuff.  I want to thank everyone for the advice because I was honestly getting paranoid because I've been cheated on before and my friends are kinda cynical so they expected the worst which me made me do the same. Ironically because of this whole thing and the talk we had after, I feel like I can trust him more. For now I'm gonna try to stop assuming the worst.  Thanks to everyone who chipped in.  TLDR: My boyfriend and I had a talk about what happened. He explained to me his point of view and I explained to him mine. He understood why I was upset and I feel like we really got on the same page. So, everything worked out for the best.","Glad to hear things worked out. > I was honestly getting paranoid because I've been cheated on before. Don't ignore red flags and the need to reasonably check on what your partner is doing (in general in relationships), but also keep in mind that only YOU have this paranoia and trauma from past relationships.   He doesn't, so I totally see how this attempt by your friend to hook up was a non-issue for him, he shot her down hard, matter was resolved in his mind, and thus not worth mentioning.  He should have told you (so you could build trust), but the point I'm trying to make is he didn't do it out of malice, he just didn't have the same mental perspective as you because he didn't have the trauma. And you should take care of that trauma by talking to a therapist.  If you don't, you're basically burdening him with it. But, good that things worked out, and wish you guys the best for the future.  Keep that communication going, it really strengthens the relationship.",3075

I sat him down and told him that some of the stuff that she says really makes me uncomfortable. I told him that I feel like she's undermining our relationship. I gave him a few examples of the stuff she said and done that I didn't appreciate. He still doesn't think she's into him. He's convinced that she's acting this way because she probably feels like they're drifting apart as friends because he's in a serious relationship now. Which frustrated me a little tbh because its clear to me that she wants him but being subtle about it. He said that regardless of her intentions, if her actions are making me uncomfortable. He'll have a talk with her about it. I was really happy he said that, because I was really nervous and anxious to see how he'll react. I was afraid he'll take her side. He can be a dummy sometimes so I was worried that he'd bring it up with her in the wrong way. Like saying ""my girlfriend doesnt want us talking anymore"" and stuff like that but he nailed it. He told her in a text ""Dude, I noticed some of the stuff you've been saying in front of my girlfriend lately and I've been wanting to talk to you about it. It's mad disrespectful and uncomfortable. We're cool, but just stop that s\*\*t"". Naturally, she acted all innocent and confused. She was like ""what? you know I'd never do anything that would upset you"" ""I think you're misunderstanding"" and stuff like that. He doubled down on it though. I could tell he felt somewhat guilty telling her off like that and I don't know if he's convinced that she's trying to undermine our relationship or not, but I'm so glad that he had my back in this. I'm honestly kind of glad this whole thing happened. It gave me a better idea of what kind of man he really is. He even said he'll stop hanging out with her alone if it makes me feel uncomfortable. He was also, lowkey mad at me for waiting this long to tell him I was uncomfortable around her. Safe to say that the best possible outcome happened. He really put her in her place and ngl it made me feel real good. All I could think of was ""I WON!!!"" lmao. Thanks to everyone for encouraging me to tell him because even though I knew that's what I should have done I was still scared to do it for some reason. I even thought about potentially just avoiding her for good. Which sounds ridiculous now that I think about it, because I shouldn't have to hide from her. I guess I'm just not good at confrontations. Thanks for the helpful advice everyone. TLDR: I told my boyfriend that his friend's actions were making me uncomfortable because she's clearly into him and she's undermining our relationship. He let her know that she has to stop and totally had my back during the whole thing. All and all everything turned out pretty great. Thanks to everyone for the great advice.",This sounds like a man who is prioritizing your feelings and your relationship. Quality boyfriend material ,3018
msx4sa," [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mrah04/my_girlfriend_wants_to_take_a_stressful_job_and_i/) I (27M) would like to thank everyone who took time to give me valuable advice, it helped me realize I was going about it the wrong way and possibly ruined a relationship of 7 years . Yesterday, we sat down and had a proper conversation. I apologized to her for lashing out with an ultimatum, I explained how scared I was of things sliding back. She (28F) was able to understand it and she also pointed out how hurtful me setting down and ultimatum was. I talked about mapping out a plan so that we don't slid into the mess we had created. I think me being open to the idea of her working allowed her to be vulnerable and reveal why she wanted to chase money. She wants to put down roots in the city and buy a house here. she grow up in pretty unstable circumstance and moved around a lot. She is adamant that we own a house before we get married/have kids and the home market here is booming. She also thought that it was a bit embarrassing to be so fixated on owning a house and wanted to take the whole burden on herself. I really love this woman. I know that her actions in the past has not been great but even after that I trust her to be kind. I think, this perspective is not something I could have ever thought of , I come from a more privileged background and even though my parents raised us to be independent but we always knew that if things got ugly, we had a safety net. She never had that and I understand her need to create one. After we stopped crying and talking. we went through the budget and talked about areas where we could cut expenses. She really doesn't want to change jobs, so we are planning on her asking for a raise and I think I will start looking for a new job. I am pretty indifferent about my workplace and I don't mind jumping ship to increase my salary. She is happy and would have disliked to move to another company. I have to really thank the people here for helping us talk this out. I am planning on bringing up counselling on a later date. we have a lingering issue on communication that we need to sort out. Tl;DR: we talked it out and I found out what she wanted and she was worried about money. We made a plan to fix it.",So happy the two of you were able to be open and communicate with each other about this!  Please make sure you continue this communication and have an action plan in case your lives take a separate turn from each other as you pursue this serious joint purchase.,918
n21e9c,"When I was about 9 years old, I realized my mom was having an affair for years on my military dad.  I did not say anything as I was really worried what would happen if I said anything. When I was about 12 years old, I found my dad looking at pictures of our family and tearing up and I couldn't take it and I told him about moms affair. Fastforward 5 years and I live full time with dad and his new wife and step sister and our lives have improved so much since leaving mom.  Well grandpa on dad's side has been pressuring my dad to get a paternity test as he wants to make sure that ""I am his grand daughter"". This is getting really intense as grandpa may pass away soon and he says he doesn't know if he should leave us anything if he doesn't even know... Well my dad has resisted this for years and saying it doesn't matter. But now things have changed as I have half sibling on the way. I am totally happy and fine with this, but for some reason my dad has started to change his mind about the paternity dna test thing. He says he is worried that I won't receive help with my college or anything, but im worried he is wondering if he should care about me or just my new sibling. I am not sure how much money my grandpa has, but he does have a big house and a lot of property so I guess it's important.

n7yj49,"Tomorrow will be my 2nd Mother’s Day. Normally my husband doesn’t care for holidays unless he’s getting something. So on birthdays, Valentine’s Day, etc. he goes out the day of and gets me the first thing he sees (last year he got me 2 redbulls and a card from the display in front of Walmart and didn’t even sign it, and I still had to cook, clean, and watch our baby while he played video games). Today he sent me to get his mom and grandma giftcards to a chocolate place, and then said to just get chocolate for myself too and I feel annoyed. Not with getting money for a gift, but because it was a gift to brush me off so I couldn’t say he didn’t get me anything, and the gift is also attached to a chore. He just had 3 days off in a row and spent every day gone from noon-4am with friends. He had time to pick out gifts but just didn’t feel like it. So now, not only do I have to drive 40 mins away to pick up last min gifts for his family while I’m up to my eyeballs in tests, I feel like an afterthought especially since after 3 years married he should know I don’t eat chocolate so telling me to pick out some is irritating. Idc if my gift is cheap or homemade, I just hate lazy and thoughtless gifts. It makes me feel unappreciated and like I’m not worth any time or effort. He could have literally just offered to watch our son so I could relax and I would have loved it, but since he’s satisfied gift “requirements” he’s already made plans to spend tomorrow at a car meet with his friends. Am I just being ungrateful and overreacting?

About 98% of you were super wonderful on my last post and seemed genuinely invested so I thought I'd give you all an update.  It's been just under a week now and after trying some of the different tactics and talking points you suggested, in addition to reaching out to the deaf/HOH community, my parents and I have come to a compromise, if only to shut me up. But I'm not the one that's important here, that would be Ana (6f). So, come the new school year Ana will be going to the school my parents chose BUT we (including me!) will be keeping in close contact with her teachers, specialists, etc, her progress and talking to Ana herself about how she feels. If it seems like it isn't a great fit, we will be transferring her to the deaf school. It's a little out of the area, but I think we can make it work.  I did open up to my parents a bit - as much as they could handle - and told them that I feel like I've been, not robbed but had a stunted childhood and that my academic abilities forced me to grow up quickly. That, coupled with their emotional distance and lack of physical presence with Ana, made me angry and frustrated that my opinions on her future weren't being taken into account. I wish I could say that was what did it, but honestly my points about the school not teaching Ana independence and other arguments brought up on the original post probably eased them over to my side a bit (I kept my temper even this time). I mentioned in my edit on the last post that I'd gotten in contact with a Deaf Advocacy group and they've provided some wonderful resources so hopefully sometime soon Ana will FINALLY be able to meet kids and adults like her! (She's SUPER excited by this. She's the least reserved and most outgoing sibling out of us three so I've no doubt she'll make friends quickly.) I've also made the decision to start seeing a therapist to maybe work on some of the issues that I've been reflecting on and to get some emotional support where my mom and dad drop the ball. I don't see them changing or even admitting they need to change anytime soon. But that doesn't mean I have to stay complacent.  That's...more or less the main chunk of what I wanted to say. I notice the rules say we aren't allowed to upload images so I'll just describe the drawing Ana just gave me to pin up on my office wall (she's a brilliant little artist, I'm not even biased). *An ocean surface. A large boat approaches from the left hand side, full of garbage. A great blue whale stands, mid-breech, opposing, brandishing a gun in one flipper. A speech bubble from the whale reads* ***'NO!'*** *while the ambiguously-gendered humans on the Garbage Boat scream in terror, presumably ready to flee.*  (Her kindergarten assignment was to come up with a way we can protect our oceans from pollution and personally, I think she's hit the nail on the head.) Thank you so much to everyone for your thoughts and feedback! **TL;DR: my parents and I came to a compromise on my deaf sister's elementary school, I am working through my issues, Ana is getting to know her community and she drew an awesome picture today.**","You fought for her. That's amazing. I know we're strangers, but I was a 17 year old once, and I know how hard it can be to stand up to the adults in your life at that age, so I'm really proud of you. And I'm glad your sister has you in her life. You did a good thing.  Tell her that her drawing is awesome!",1315
ndbv44,"My fiancé and I have talked about this a few times, and it always ends with her angry and crying. I love her so much but I cannot get past this point. Here’s the issue: She has a younger brother I’ve known about since we’ve dated in college. He’s a very low functioning autistic, to the extent that he will need full-time supervision and care for the rest of his adult life. He’s a sweetheart and a great kid, and he and my fiancé are about as close as siblings can get.  We want kids, but whenever we get on the topic she brings up her brother and talks about how “you won’t even notice he’s there” and that “he can really take care of himself, he just needs some supervision is all.” I’ve taken a lot of time to consider it, and as much as I like her brother, I’m not marrying her for her family.  She wants us to take care of him alongside our children, to live with us as soon as I’m done with Med school until presumably we die.  I’ve told her I love her brother, but I don’t want him to live with us and our kids, if we choose to have them. Her parents are two wonderful people, and I feel they are much more equipped to take care of him like they have the last 21 years.  My position is that he will be happier and better taken care of with his parents, and that it is their responsibility to do so. As far as I’m aware they’re planning on doing this anyway, but every time my fiancé and I have this conversation it ends with tears.  TL;DR - My fiancé wants us to take care of her autistic younger brother, I don’t think it would be best for him or us. We are not as well equipped as her parents to do so.",This is a deal breaker.   The only way you can go forward with this relationship and your planned marriage is if you are 100% OK with you and your fiancé being lifetime guardians and care givers for the brother.   This isn’t something that you can change her mind on without a lifetime of resentment.   Even if parents continue to care for the boy they will get too old to do so someday and this subject is certain to resurface in the future.   I feel sorry for you as you have a very serious decision to make.  Think of the life you want and choose wisely.,3881

Realized I have no idea how to hit on my husband or initiate in general. My last post didn't get a ton of attention, but I thought I would update people anyways. I took most everyone's advice and talked to my husband. He thought the whole situation was hilarious (in a nice way). But he was very reassuring. I told him about my fears of rejection, or doing something wrong. How my body issues have made it difficult to initiate because I fear I wont be able to turn him on. He gave me some ideas on how I might come on to him, what subtle moves might work to help initiate. He also reassured me that unless something major was going or he was sick, he would pretty much always reciprocate. He soothed my body fears and told me he finds me very attractive and I shouldn't worry about that.  You guys, this has been life changing. Talking with my husband completely alleviated my fears. After a couple of false starts, I was able to start initiating. And its been going great. We're both all over each other all the time, just like we were highschoolers again. Maybe even better.

I decided to just spend some time with her. She loves to bake and we baked together and we had some movie nights. her comments melted away and she became happier.  we were baking yesterday when she came out to me. I didn't make a big deal out of as I felt she didn't want me to. I just told her I loved her before continuing to bake as if nothing happened. We did have a conversation later on.  She told me that she and her friend had been together ( scary, how well kids can hide things.) Her girlfriend wanted to come out but she didn't and it had strained their relationship. It seems, they had a fight before we gave her the books to her (ex?) girlfriend and that had hurt her. Their relationship is in the limbo and she doesn't want to come out to the world right now. My husband ordered a small pride flag to keep in her room. The world is a bit crazy right now and we want her to have a space where she can be herself.   TL;DR : My daughter came out to me, her friend was actually her girlfriend and they had a fight.","I wish I had you as my mother. No I'm not gay but to take the time to learn from others on how to take care of your daughter lovingly is a really good trait and she is lucky that instead of you responding back in kind or from a place of negativity, you are responding with love.",2730
nit3wr,"I have four daughters – two biological (“Sarah” 32F & “Suzie” 30F) and two stepdaughters (“Amy” 31F & “Annie” 28F). My oldest daughter and youngest stepdaughter don’t really like each other anymore. They’re barely civil, and they completely ignore each other unless they’re forced to interact. Sarah is struggling financially. It’s partly due to the pandemic but mostly due to her husband and his lack of work ethic or financial sense. He spends money faster than they earn it and we’ve bailed them out multiple times already. The pandemic has hit me hard financially so I’m no longer in a position to help them.  On the other hand, Annie is married to a wealthy man and has generously been helping everyone (excluding Sarah) financially for the past year. Annie invited my wife and me to join her family at her in-law’s holiday home. She offered to cover all of our expenses and my wife missed her a lot, so we agreed to go. We didn’t really think about how it would make Sarah feel. Sarah found out about the trip and is now furious at me. She thinks I’m lying about not having money to help her and doesn’t believe Annie would pay for it. She is refusing to speak to me and has told Suzie she feels like I replaced them with my stepdaughters.  I would really like to fix this, but she continues to ignore any attempt by me to get into contact with her. TL;DR – I went on a trip to visit my stepdaughter, she covered all of our expenses but my oldest daughter, who is struggling financially,  doesn’t believe me and is now refusing to speak to me.","My first thought when reading your title was ""she needs to get over it. It's your money."" But reading the post, it wasn't even your money, it was a gift. You are free to accept gifts as you wish. And your daughter needs to get over it anyway.",4619

I was so nervous that I felt sick and I literally almost canceled last minute, but I'm so happy that I went through with it! I told him beforehand that I had anxiety about not knowing where he was taking me and I didn't know what to wear. He still wouldn't give away the surprise but he did tell me to dress comfortably, so I just wore one of my nice casual dresses. He made us an outdoor drive-in movie theatre (don't ask me how he did it because I'm hopeless with technology) where we watched my favorite movie and he brought popcorn and my favorite chocolate! Afterwards he took me to this new bookstore cafe in our town which had just opened and I had been dying to go to. I was so happy when he finally kissed me even though I had been previously dreading that he would. We actually kissed quite a bit. I found that my heart was beating not from nerves this time, but from genuine excitement. Now I look forward to intimacy with him and I feel like it'll just make us even closer. It's still unbelievable to me that this is happening, but it doesn't scare me anymore. I never thought Connor would ever make me feel like this. In my head it just wasn't a possibility since we were such good friends. I couldn't be happier that I decided to give him a chance instead of just immediately shutting it down in fear of ruining the friendship. In reality, our friendship was never in any danger. Yes, there are real differences between dating and just being best friends but there are WAY more similarities than I was expecting. The conversation still flowed the same way it did when we were only friends and we still have plenty of fun and laughs. I'm overjoyed that our friendship dynamic hasn't changed because I was mainly worried that things would be awkward now and I wouldn't know how to behave around him. Now it feels like we're friends who just happen to be dating and IMO that's exactly how things should be. Seeing how happy he is just feels like the cherry on top. TL;DR: I was terrified to date my best friend. I ended up being pleasantly surprised and I had fun on the date. Thank you so much to everyone who calmed me down and told me to be honest with him about my anxiety beforehand because your advice really helped!",I am so so happy this worked out as well as it did and you got comfortable!!! I just married my childhood best friend of 24 years earlier this year and being married to my absolute best friend has been the most amazing experience ever,1392
nmy29p,"I have always had an active imagination and a rich fantasy life. It helps that I like to write and I'm able to bring a lot of that to my stories. But I also have a rich fantasy life that I keep to myself as sort of an escape from reality. My therapist wants me to unpack this a little and distance myself from it. And I guess I'm looking for a little perspective.  For background, I've been married for 5 years and together 12. My husband is a good man, kind and loving. We have one child (4F). We both work full time, and we have dates and time together. In many ways I'm satisfied. But at the core, my husband and I are different people. He is not passionate and not interested in the same things I am for the most part. I also have little interest in his hobbies. So we both have inner lives that are separate from the other.  I'll make up stories to get myself through the day. Like I'll see a stranger at the library and I imagine a meeting of the minds relationship with this complete stranger. Or I'll leave home at night and go for drives and listen to romantic songs and put myself in the lyrics. I thumb through travel websites and imagine entire lives in those places. My therapist has been gently telling me that this might be unhealthy behavior, and that I should give more thought to being present in the world. Anyone else dealing with a similar dilemma? Any advice?  --- **tl;dr**: Married woman with stable married life, no real issues except imagination.","I think you should probably focus on what your therapist says. Seeking outside opinion on a topic that you're covering in therapy with a professional is rarely going to be helpful in the long run. We don't know you, we don't know the extent of this behavior, we aren't trained in dealing with this kind of thing. Stick to what your therapist says. The fact that you came to strangers on the internet for a second opinion is a pretty good indication that this is in fact an issue.",2559
nqhc9l, [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n9q8k4/i_28m_messed_up_by_asking_my_girlfriend_26f_to/)    All the comments here helped me understand that we needed to talk about the issue but she was still a bit mad at me. I thought I should just give her space for a few days. I think a day or two after It was announced that I was being promoted. Some of  my colleagues hosted a little after work dinner for me as I would be moving divisions and not working with them anymore. It was nice and It really touched me and it also made me understand how fucked our relationship had become. I got what the comments meant but I guess actually having a nice dinner celebrating my success felt great and made me truly understand how unhappy I felt.  we had the talk a few days later. I told her that I felt unhappy and unappreciated. That I felt like I needed some time away from her. She almost seemed like she was waiting for this. she didn't seem particularly upset over it. She said she understood and she would move back to her parents as soon as possible. I know it is ugly but some part of me wanted her to be upset. some proof that she cared for me? I don't know. I feel like she didn't love me at all. I feel like I wasted years being in love with her.  She moved out two weeks ago and I miss her a lot. Home feels really lonely without her but at the same time I feel better. Not a lot but I feel a bit better about myself. It is strange.  She is not a bad person. she is a wonderful person and that is why I fell in love with her but the closer we got the less happy our relationship made me. I know a lot of it was my fault and I need to work on communication skills.     TL;DR : I realized how profoundly unhappy our relationship made me and broke up with her.,"You made the right decision, you can't compete with a ghost",2761
nti1h4,"Update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ns0k6y/ldr_boyfriend_m23_cheated_on_me_f20_after_3_years/) post. **TL;DR from that post is:** Boyfriend of 3 years cheating with someone else, they've been together for 9 months. I broke up with him. She doesn't know I exist. She sounds severely depressed, suicidal and self-harms plus issues with drugs and alcohol. He asked me not to tell her as she would ""kill herself"". Unsure if I should - moral conundrum. Help. &#x200B; I told her. Sent her a long message from my own instagram account (no burners or anything). Lots of empathy and kindness. Told her I was on her side. She asked for proof, sent that through.  Ex texted me 5 mins later with ""You did it hey?"" (I'd blocked him on all social medias except for phone number). Then he weirdly thanked me; said it was better for his head and mental health now. I did him a favour. Baffled me a little. Sent him a couple harsh text messages explaining it wasn't for him, but for her. She deserved the truth. He apologised again, lol, and then I sent him a final message and blocked. Girl seemed devestated, not angry at me thankfully as I was scared of her spinning it against me which I don't think I could've handled in my... delicate state lol. Told her I was there for her. Had a little chat, but haven't talked to her since (12hrs ago). Not expecting to continue talking. Dunno if she properly broke up with him, or taking a break since they still follow eachother but she changed her profile pic so it's no longer matching and relationship date from her bio is gone. None of my business what happens next, I just hope she's okay and takes the next steps which are healthy for her. No idea if she's suicidal/self-harming - I had that in the long message sent to her that 'he told me you were vulnerable and suffering from depression so I debated sending this msg but I think you deserve the truth'. Inevitably, I think it's better for her to know rather than confide in a liar who is abusing her vulnerability.  Thank you to everyone who replied on the previous post, definitely helped to see other strangers agreeing with sending a message and informing her. If anyone ends up in a similar situ, I hope you never do, but send the message to the ***unknowing*** affair partner. It'll relieve your conscience I think, even though you're not in the wrong. That sounds weird, but trust me I know **I** was the one cheated on and that she was the 'other woman' but it still felt good to tell her what the real truth was, rather than him spinning it against me or never telling her. It's kinda like a final kaboom in my exes face, making sure he can't just go crawling to his other girlfriend now that I broke up with him, and she knew the full truth and can decide what to do next (break up or stay together).  I feel relieved. I have finally stopped feeling nauseated and throwing up. Had my first good nights sleep since I found out. Nothing but bad feelings for the ex. I dunno if it's hate, that's a strong word. I resent what he put me through, and the waste of time, and the lies for such a long time. He's made me unsure of myself and everything he told me, but I have enough self-respect to break-up with him. Miss what I thought we had I think? I dunno. It was all lies I guess. I want him to figure himself out, mature and eventually settle down (not with me). Holding all my resentment against the cheating ex, not affair partner.  The hurt is setting in now. Last couple days it was anger. Now it's just pain lol. Now, can anyone offer post-discovering-your-long-term-partners-been-cheating-on-you-for-almost-a-year advice? I'm not used to not being busy and am having too many thoughts, I just finished final exams so have been studying for months and been busy and now its... nothing. Glad I found out after exams, but not sure what to do now. Advice appreciated. **TL;DR:** Told the unknowing affair partner via Instagram DMs on my personal account. Long, empathetic message telling her I'm on her side + proof when she asked for it. Ex texted me ""you did it hey?"" and then thanked me. Blocked his number. She seems sad, unsure if 100% broken up but pfps and date in bio changed. I don't care, not my business. Hope for the best for her. Now I need advice on how to heal, if anyone has any. Thanks.","When he comes crawling back (and believe me babe, he will) you shoot me a message and I’ll venmo you money for a drink on me. So proud of you girl.",453
ntmvar,"EDIT: didn't expect this to blow up in the way it did. I'm not looking for advice anymore, I'm just here to update. Stop telling me to message her, or him, or whoever. I'm not comfortable with that anymore, and I will not be getting involved further. So my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nldn80/i_23f_had_a_one_night_stand_with_a_guy_25m_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) got quite a few responses, so I figured I should update on the situation. I wish I could say I swooped in and was the hero of the story, and rescued this girl from potentially more years of being disrespected by this man, but I'm pretty sure she saved herself. I read every comment on that post and weighed up all the options, and I decided I would wait exactly a month and half, so that it wasn't so obvious who I was, then make a burner account and dm the girlfriend just with some vague information about what happened, and leave it up to her to decide if she wants to believe me. However, shortly after I made that post, I checked both of their Facebook profiles and they now both say ""single"". She has also removed all pictures of him. On her latest instagram posts, there's a few comments from her friends expressing that they're here for her, they hope she's OK etc. So it's safe to say they broke up. My guess is that he was sleeping with other girls as well as with me, and one of them alerted her to it. So it worked out in the end. A very sad situation, but at least she's not wasting more of her precious young years on that guy. TL;DR they broke up before I could tell her",That or she ended up with an STD due to him sleeping with multiple people and found out that way...you might wanna get tested.,1487
