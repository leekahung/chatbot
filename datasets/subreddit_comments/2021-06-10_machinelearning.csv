43fl90,"Hi there. Earlier this month I had [a discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3zdibn/intelligent_agents_for_hearthstone/cylnbf2) over on /r/hearthstone with /u/yetipirate about Computer Go. Then the news hit this week of the first Go AI to beat a human professional. We had some more discussion then, and I made a synopsis of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHRHUHW6HQE), where the US Go Association has Myungwan Kim, 9-Dan Pro, analyse the games between the AlphaGo AI and human professional Fan Hui, 2-Dan Pro. (FTR: Professional go ranks start at 1-Dan and go up to 9-Dan, but rather than the absolute top 9-Dan is more like the beginning of grandmastery. The best players in the world are like 9-Dan+++++. Lee Sedol, which AlphaGo will challenge next this March, is at this latter level.) /u/yetipirate suggested this synopsis might interest some people here as well, since it digests the salient points of a two hour video with lots of Go jargon into a more manageable post. So hence I'm posting it here, I hope you all enjoy it. Feel free to ask me any questions about Go, but I'm not that strong myself so ymmv. Anyway without further ado: **In General:** The match has been big news in East-Asia as well. The thing which most shocked all the professionals was that AlphaGo played so much like a human player. Their first impressions were that it's as if this was a human playing, not a computer. Since how a human plays is, obviously, pretty well known, they decided that they'll focus commentary mostly on those cases where AlphaGo doesn't play like a human. The first thing that Myungwan Kim noted was that AlphaGo has a Japanese playstyle (this is especially interesting because among the three traditional Go powerhouses, China, Korea, and Japan, the Japanese have been the weakest in international competitions for the past several decades). The commentators don't know, but they suspect it is that the original human data set was biased towards Japanese playstyles. Myungwan Kim also makes a comment about one of the lines continually repeated in the coverage of Computer Go. The line that ""if you ask a top Go player why they like a certain move, they'll often say 'it felt right'"". Myungwan Kim wanted to add that just because it's based on intuition, doesn't mean there's no logic behind it at all. Top Go players aren't just guessing what are good moves, they have a real and complicated rational understanding about what specific moves are doing. Even if the final decision might come down to which move feels the best, it's not as simple as top pro's just doing a random move and saying 'I felt like it'. **The Games:** In the **first game** both sides played very passively in the opening. Leisurely and gentle they say. Myungwan Kim finds that AlphaGo has a weakness here, it doesn't seem to understand the value of taking and holding initiative. Complicated to explain, but at its core it's about doing moves which force your opponent to use their turn to react to your move over doing moves which might be equally valuable to you, but leave your opponent free to do whatever they want on their turn. Important, Myungwan Kim says because of this that the first game Fan Hui was winning in the opening. He says this was the only game Fan Hui was winning after the opening. He estimates Fan Hui was about 10 points ahead, and can't see white getting back even 5 points coming out of that opening. Myungwan Kim offers some alternate moves for AlphaGo which would still have Fan Hui in the lead, but would've given AlphaGo better opportunities to comeback. Conclusion from the opening: AlphaGo lost because it didn't understand the value of initiative. Myungwan Kim later points to one huge mistake by Fan Hui in the midgame that lost him the game. I can't go into detail here because, as characteristic of top-level Go, it's the difference of placing one stone one space higher. But Myungwan Kim says that while Fan Hui made other small mistakes, this one move is the big one which let AlphaGo come back from losing the opening. Final conclusion from game one: Aside from not understanding initiative. Myungwan Kim says AlphaGo betrays itself as a computer in that it sometimes it goes too far in mimicking standard professional play and does the most common move instead of the most optimal move. In other words, it's extremely book smart, but at times fails to notice when it should be ignoring the books because the specific situation in the game makes the less standard move the most optimal one instead. (A bit cliche imo, but Myungwan Kim says ""AlphaGo is not creative"".) They think that might really hurt AlphaGo in the game against Lee Sedol. **Game 2**, they note Fan Hui really played too aggressively, as he noted in his own post-match interview. Myungwan Kim says he can really see Fan Hui wasn't playing his best game, but was trying to test AlphaGo to see if it could be tricked into making exploitable mistakes. Myungwan Kim says Fan Hui actually put up a really good fight. After the opening it should've been over for Fan Hui, but AlphaGo almost allowed Fan Hui to get back in the game. **Game 3** is similar to the fifth game, though Fan Hui played better in the beginning here. Myungwan Kim notes several moves by AlphaGo which are top professional moves. He notes some moves by Fan Hui which he thinks hints that Fan Hui might be a bit out of practice when it comes to playing professional level games (he says it's the kind of move you do if too used to playing teaching games against amateurs). Fan Hui lost because he played over-aggressive and left too many holes in his defence as a result. On the **fifth game**, Myungwan Kim says AlphaGo was winning from the beginning here. They marvel at some of AlphaGo's moves here, but they're not sure whether AlphaGo really knew what it was doing or if it just got 'lucky' somehow. Myungwan Kim points out AlphaGo made a huge mistake early in this game, but was saved because not long after Fan Hui made an equally huge mistake. But this is an example where he thinks a real grandmaster like Lee Sedol would not have allowed AlphaGo to get away with the kind of mistake it made there. **AlphaGo's Strengths and Weaknesses:** Myungwan Kim lists AlphaGo's strengths:  * It's not afraid of 'Ko'. 'Ko' is too complex a concept to explain succinctly, for an attempt [see my post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/43fl90/synopsis_of_top_go_professionals_analysis_of/czi7swh). They marvel at some of AlphaGo's moves surrounding a 'Ko' situation, but aren't sure if AlphaGo really knew what it was doing or just got lucky that it worked out.  * Reading might be AlphaGo's strength. As in, cases where it comes down to very straightforward fights and moves it's very strong at choosing the right moves. Myungwan Kim lists AlphaGo's weaknesses:  * Doesn't understand initiative, as explained earlier.  * At times too obsessed with following common patterns, when the specific situation might require creative deviation from those patterns. Also explained earlier.  * It doesn't understand 'Aji'. 'Aji' is difficult to explain, but it refers to the amount of uncertainty remaining in a specific grouping of white and black stones. (Usually, it's about the chance that a group of stones which is 'death' might become alive and vice versa as a result of things happening elsewhere on the board.) You can also put this differently as: AlphaGo lacks proper long-term thinking.  * Myungwan Kim thinks AlphaGo has difficulty, or even doesn't at all, evaluating the value of specific stones. It's good at making moves which directly gain territory for itself, but tends to miss moves which reduce the value of the opponent's stones.  * It can make really high level moves at times, but it doesn't understand those moves. Which it displays by making the right moves at the wrong time. More generally Myungwan Kim thinks a weakness of AlphaGo is its insularity. He really stresses that human pro's become much stronger when they discuss and analyse their games with other pro's. And because AlphaGo primarily plays against itself the quality of the feedback it gets on its play is too one-note, which leaves holes in its plays whereas human pro's getting feedback from many other human pro's end up with more robust and stronger playstyles. He really thinks to progress past its current level AlphaGo needs to play more with top human pro's rather than just itself. Right now, Myungwan Kim en most pro's he knows don't feel threatened by AlphaGo. They also talk about how AlphaGo can be useful for human pro's to study and become stronger, which can make AlphaGo stronger in turn. (This last paragraph is imo all just Myungwan Kim musing based on his understanding of how AlphaGo was designed more than evaluating its plays themselves, so that's why I didn't list it as a bullet point.) In general, I get the sense from Myungwan Kim's explanations that he thinks AlphaGo is stronger at the more concrete parts of Go play, such as territory and life-or-death, and weaker at the more vague concepts, such as influence and uncertainty. **[word limit hit, final part below]**","**Upcoming Match Against Lee Sedol:** Myungwan Kim says that with all his respect to the Google team, he thinks AlphaGo as it played against Fan Hui will have no chance against Lee Sedol. He says all pro's who've looked at these games generally agree that AlphaGo would need a one or two stone handicap against Lee Sedol. Myungwan Kim actually says he thinks AlphaGo when it faces off against Lee Sedol might be as strong as he is. In which case he still predicts Lee Sedol will win every game. They think that Lee Sedol won't make the mistake of playing overly aggressive like Fan Hui did. They feel Google is overplaying their hand somewhat challenging Lee Sedol this quickly. They say it's an amazing accomplishment to get an AI this strong, but as is it's not yet at grandmaster level. So by moving the goalpost from beating a low-level pro to beating a grandmaster this quickly they're somewhat cheapening their own accomplishment in beating Fan Hui. **My thoughts:** Just keep in mind even at my best when I played a lot I was never more than a middle-ranking amateur (not even a Dan rank, just a high Kyuu rank). But what I find interesting is what seems like a polar opposition between AlphaGo and Deep Blue. Deep Blue worked, afaik, because it could read much further ahead than any human chess player. But AlphaGo actually has as its weakness that it doesn't read ahead that well at all (and one difference between Chess and Go players is that Go players can in limited ways read dozens and dozens of moves ahead). Deep Blue worked by being a superhuman calculator. AlphaGo works by having a kind of superhuman intuition about what are good and what are bad moves, but it still makes mistakes because it doesn't really understand why a move is good or bad. It'll be very interesting whether the program as is can ever compensate for that flaw. Since I don't understand anything about the program my first guess would just be yes, but if it turns out to be no, that would actually be even more fascinating. From a Go perspective and from a programming perspective, I'd wager. :)",211

4j0u2z,"Hi there, my name is Harrison and I frequently do Python programming tutorials on [PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net) and [YouTube.com/sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex).  I do my best to produce tutorials for beginner-intermediate programmers, mainly by making sure nothing is left to abstraction and hand waving.  The most recent series is an in-depth machine learning course, aimed at breaking down the complex ML concepts that are typically just ""done for you"" in a hand-wavy fashion with packages and modules.  The machine learning series is aimed at just about anyone with a basic understanding of Python programming and the willingness to learn. If you're confused about something we're doing, I can either help, or point you towards a tutorial that I've done already (I have about 1,000) to help. The main structure for the course is to: * Do a quick overview of the theory of each machine learning algorithm we cover. * Show an application of that algorithm using a module, like scikit-learn, along with some real world data. * Break down the algorithm and re-write it ourselves, **without machine learning modules**, in Python. We're not rewriting the algorithms with the intention that we're going to actually produce something superior than what's available, but rather to learn more about how the algorithms actually work, so that we understand them better. I also see a lot of people are very keen to learn about deep-learning, but the learning curve to get to that point is quite challenging, since quite a bit of deep learning requires you to have a wholistic understanding of how things are actually working, and not just a high-level understanding of how to use a module. Hopefully this can help.  At least for me personally, I have learned a lot by breaking the algorithms down, so I thought I would share that in my tutorials. All tutorials are posted on **[PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/)** as well as **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)**, so you can follow along in video, text, or both forms, and the content is all free.  We've done linear regression and K Nearest Neighbors so far, and have quite a long way to go still. We are going to be diving into the Support Vector Machine next, then clustering, neural networks and deep learning. Once we've made our way to deep learning, we're going to be working with TensorFlow. If all that sounds interesting to you, come hang out and learn with us!  I tend to release a couple videos a week. If you have suggestions/requests, feel free to share.

6l2esd,"Seriously. I spent the last few years doing web app development. Dug into DL a couple months ago. Supposedly, compared to the post-post-post-docs doing AI stuff, JavaScript developers should be inbred peasants. But every project these peasants release, even a fucking library that colorizes CLI output, has a catchy name, extensive docs, shitloads of comments, fuckton of tests, semantic versioning, changelog, and, oh my god, better variable names than `ctx_h` or `lang_hs` or `fuck_you_for_trying_to_understand`. The concepts and ideas behind DL, GANs, LSTMs, CNNs, whatever – it's clear, it's simple, it's intuitive. The slog is to go through the jargon (that keeps changing beneath your feet - what's the point of using fancy words if you can't keep them consistent?), the unnecessary equations, trying to squeeze meaning from bullshit language used in papers, figuring out the super important steps, preprocessing, hyperparameters optimization that the authors, oops, failed to mention. Sorry for singling out, but [look at this](https://github.com/facebookresearch/end-to-end-negotiator/blob/master/src/agent.py) - what the fuck? If a developer anywhere else at Facebook would get this code for a review they would throw up. - Do you intentionally try to obfuscate your papers? Is pseudo-code a fucking premium? Can you at least try to give some intuition before showering the reader with equations? - How the fuck do you dare to release a paper without source code? - Why the fuck do you never ever add comments to you code? - When naming things, are you charged by the character? Do you get a bonus for acronyms? - Do you realize that OpenAI having needed to release a ""baseline"" TRPO implementation is a fucking disgrace to your profession? - Jesus christ, who decided to name a tensor concatenation function `cat`? ","I've struggled with some of these issues myself (I'm a programmer first, with an interest in ML). Some general thoughts I've encountered: - Academic papers are by their nature often the wrong place to look if you're trying to grok ideas. *Space* is at a premium in many publications, so authors are incentivized to write papers that are information dense. - A lot of researchers aren't ""programmers first"". By that I mean they often approach code as a one-off means to an end, not something they're sticking into a real system and responsible for maintaining indefinitely. - Related to the above, the audience they're used to communicating to often have similar experience. What's obvious to them (and thus not elaborated on) isn't always going to align with what's obvious to you. ...that's not to say things shouldn't be improved. Some of the ideas coming out are immensely useful, and improving usability is a valuable activity. This is an area where *developers* shine - code is what they deal with every day. If you spend time working through shitty uncommented code, improve it. Worst case you have better code to work from, but the feedback can also be useful for helping authors to write better code in the future. If they're publishing code, there's at least a decent chance they'll take feedback to heart. Most people don't *want* to put shitty code out there, but that's not necessarily their area of expertise.",392

73n9pm,"I have a confession to make. I was a CS major in college and took very few advanced math or stats courses. Besides basic calculus, linear algebra, and probability 101, I took only one machine learning class. It was about very specific SVMs/decision tree/probabilistic graphical models that I rarely encounter today. I joined a machine learning lab in college and was mentored by a senior PhD. We actually had a couple of publications together, though they were nothing but minor architecture changes. Now that I’m in grad school doing AI research full-time, I thought I could continue to get away with zero math and clever lego building. Unfortunately, I fail to produce anything creative. What’s worse, I find it increasingly hard to read some of the latest papers, which probably don’t look complicated at all to math-minded students. The gap in my math/stats knowledge is taking a hefty toll on my career. For example, I’ve never heard of the term “Lipschitz” or “Wasserstein distance” before, so I’m unable to digest the Wasserstein GAN paper, let alone invent something like that by myself. Same with f-GAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00709.pdf), and SeLU (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515.pdf). I don’t have the slightest clue what the 100-page SeLU proof is doing. The “Normalizing Flow” (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05770.pdf) paper even involves physics (Langevin Flow, stochastic differential equation) … each term seems to require a semester-long course to master. I don’t even know where to start wrapping my head around.  I’ve thought about potential solutions. The top-down approach is to google each unfamiliar jargon in the paper. That doesn’t work at all because the explanation of 1 unknown points to 3 more unknowns. It’s an exponential tree expansion. The alternative bottom-up approach is to read real analysis, functional analysis, probability theory textbooks. I prefer a systematic treatment, but …  * reading takes a huge amount of time. I have the next conference deadline to meet, so I can’t just set aside two months without producing anything. My advisor wouldn’t be happy. * but if I don’t read, my mindless lego building will not yield anything publishable for the next conference. What a chicken-and-egg vicious cycle.  * the “utility density” of reading those 1000-page textbooks is very low. A lot of pages are not relevant, but I don’t have an efficient way to sift them out. I understand that some knowledge *might* be useful *some day*, but the reward is too sparse to justify my attention budget. The vicious cycle kicks in again.  * in the ideal world, I can query an **oracle** with “Langevin flow”. The oracle would return a list of pointers, “given your current math capability, you should first read chapter 7 of Bishop’s PRML book, and then chapter 10 of information theory, and then chapter 12 of …”. Google is not such an oracle for my purpose.  I’m willing to spend 1 - 2 hours a day to polish my math, but I need a more effective oracle.  Is it just me, or does anyone else have the same frustration?  EDIT: I'd appreciate it if someone could recommend *specific* books or MOOC series that focus more on **intuition and breadth**. Google lists tons of materials on real analysis, functional analysis, information theory, stochastic process, probability and measure theory, etc. Not all of them fit my use case, since I'm not seeking to redo a rigorous math major. Thanks in advance for any recommendation!  EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many people from different backgrounds to join the discussion. Looks like there are many who resonate with me! And thank you so much for all the great advice and recommendations. Please keep adding links, book titles, and your stories! This post might help another distraught researcher out of the [Valley](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2012/05/08/the-valley-of-shit/). ","You sound like me. I think you're overestimating the technical depth of these papers and underestimating your ability to eventually understand and build upon these papers. I read the parts of the papers that I do understand and slowly try to understand the parts I don't by a combination of asking others, ctrl-F-ing textbooks, googling, etc. It also helps to have a mentor who knows where your knowledge gaps are and who can point you in the right direction.",351
76xjb5,"Hi everyone.  We are David Silver (/u/David_Silver) and Julian Schrittwieser (/u/JulianSchrittwieser) from [DeepMind] (https://deepmind.com/). We are representing the team that created [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/).  We are excited to talk to you about the history of AlphaGo, our most recent research on AlphaGo, and the challenge matches against the 18-time world champion [Lee Sedol](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/alphago-korea/) in 2017 and world #1 [Ke Jie](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/alphago-china/) earlier this year.

EDIT 1: We are excited to announce that we have just published our second Nature [paper](http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature24270) on AlphaGo. This paper describes our latest program, [AlphaGo Zero] (https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch), which learns to play Go without any human data, handcrafted features, or human intervention. Unlike other versions of AlphaGo, which trained on thousands of human amateur and professional games, Zero learns Go simply by playing games against itself, starting from completely random play - ultimately resulting in our strongest player to date. We’re excited about this result and happy to answer questions about this as well. EDIT 2: We are [here](https://twitter.com/DeepMindAI/status/921058369829527552), ready to answer your questions!  EDIT 3: Thanks for the great questions, we've had a lot of fun :) ","How/why is Zero's training so stable? This was the question everyone was asking when DM announced it'd be experimenting with pure self-play training - deep RL is notoriously unstable and prone to forgetting, self-play is notoriously unstable and prone to forgetting, the two together should be a disaster without a good (imitation-based) initialization & lots of historical checkpoints to play against. But Zero starts from zero and if I'm reading the supplements right, you don't use any historical checkpoints as opponents to prevent forgetting or loops. But the paper essentially doesn't discuss this at all or even mention it other than one line at the beginning about tree search. So how'd you guys do it?",140
7htg5f,"Hey there, Let's get straight to the point : yesterday, NVIDIA released an open source[ pytorch implementation of flownet2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch), which released a CUDA version of the correlation layer introduced by the paper [FlowNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06852). It turns out out that this code is protected by NVIDIA copyright while it heavily reuse parts of a code I wrote myslef 6 months ago : [FlowNet Pytorch](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch) My goal is not to rant or to fulfil my self esteem, but to figure what to do in the most pragmatic manner in order to take the best of both worlds and make the best implementation possible. That's not the most important part, but as a proof, here are some comparisons you can make : [mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/607f99f46be3eccbd9b07c73848a68bc12156392/multiscaleloss.py#L8) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/losses.py#L46) [mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/5381bd5c699b850785ab5dec6fda523b9126c912/models/FlowNetS.py#L32) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/networks/FlowNetS.py#L11) [mine](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/5381bd5c699b850785ab5dec6fda523b9126c912/models/FlowNetS.py#L9) - [theirs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/networks/submodules.py#L7) Now as a disclaimer, I am very honoured they decided to use my code, and it is very obvious that my code is not rocket science and the main contribution of this project is not these little snippets but rather the custom layers and the pretrained weights for pytorch. However, the fact that the README is not giving any credit for what I did feels a little uncool, especially with a [License file](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/LICENSE) saying that all copyright goes to NVIDIA. My other concern is that the parts of the code that got copied were actually not very well written, and the implementation in my own repo is to my mind much better now (for example [`MulstiScaleLoss`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch/blob/master/losses.py#L46) module is a nightmare to read and to use while pytorch gives tools for making it [much more readable](https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch/blob/master/multiscaleloss.py#L15)). I could make several Pull Requests but it's not garanteed to be merged rapidly and I'd prefer to contact the author first to get things straight and make them know that all I want is the best flownet2 implementation, and as this project is already gaining a lot of stars, it would be pointless to do my own fork ^with ^blackjack ^and ^hookers My huge mistake was maybe to not have put a License in my code in the first place, but apparently, [a default one still holds](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/#choosing-the-right-license). So what would be the best to do to get to work constructively with the project authors to improve their implementation and maybe also get a little credit for the code on which they built this project ? (also, is my claim reasonable ?) Thanks in advance for your help ! EDIT thanks for your comments, I'll contact the main committor of the repo and hopefully everything will be alright! I am glad to see that it was indeed a reasonable claim EDIT2 matter is solved for me, I got in touch with them quickly, thanks everyone for your help !","You didn't do a mistake, they made one when they took code from a repo with no license on it and used it without permission.

To keep track of the next round of this, you can check https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPapersQandA/  UPDATE: Most questions have been answered, and those who I wasn't able to answer, started a discussion which would hopefully lead to an answer.  I am not able to answer any new questions on this thread, but will continue any discussions already ongoing, and will answer those questions on the next round.   I made a new help thread btw, this time I am helping people looking for papers, check it out https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8bwuyg/d_anyone_having_trouble_finding_papers_on_a/ If you have a paper you need help on, please post it in the next round of this, tentatively scheduled for April 24th.  For more information, please see the subreddit I make to track and catalog these discussions.  https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPapersQandA/comments/8bwvmg/this_subreddit_is_for_cataloging_all_the_papers/  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  I was surprised to hear that even Andrew Ng has trouble reading certain papers at times and he reaches out to other experts to get help, so I guess that it's something most of us will probably always have to deal with to some extent or another.  If you're having trouble with a particular paper, post it with the parts you are having trouble with, and hopefully me or someone else may help out. It'll be like a mini study group to extract as much valuable info from each paper.  Even if it's a paper that you're not per say totally stuck on, but it's just that it'll take a while to completely figure out, post it anyway in case you find some value in shaving off some precious time in pursuing the total comprehension of that paper, so that you can more quickly move onto other papers.  Edit: Okay we got some papers. I'm going through them one by one. Please have specific questions on where exactly you are stuck, even if it's a big picture issue. Just say something like 'what's the big picture'.  Edit 2: Gotta to do some irl stuff but will continue helping out tomorrow. Some of the papers are outside my proficiency so hopefully some other people on the subreddit can help out.  Edit 3: Okay this really blew up. Some papers it's taking a really long time to figure out.  Another request I have in addition to specific question, type out any additional info/brief summary that can help cut down on the time it will take for someone to answer the question. For example, if there's an equation whose components are explained through out the paper, make a mini glossary of said equation. Try to aim so that perhaps the reader doesn't even need to read the paper (likely not possible but aiming for this will make for excellent summary info) and they can answer your question.  What attempts have you made so far to figure out the question.  Finally, what is your best guess to what you think the answer might be, and why.  Edit 4: More people should participate in the papers, not just people who can answer the questions. If any of the papers listed are of interest to you, can you read them, and reply to the comment with your own questions about the paper, so that someone can answer both your questions. It might turn out that he person who posted the paper knows the question, and it even might be the case that you stumbled upon the answers to the original questions.  Think of each paper as an invite to an open study group for that paper, not just a queue for an expert to come along and answer it.  Edit 5: It looks like people want this to be a weekly feature here. I'm going to figure out the best format from the comments here and make a proposal to the mods.  Edit 6:  I'm still going through the papers and giving answers. Even if I can't answer the question I'll reply with something, but it'll take a while. But please provide as much summary info as I described in the last edits to help me navigate through the papers and quickly collect as much background info I need to answer the question.

8jdglx,"[This post by /u/Karyo_Ten](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8j8iu1/d_papers_writingthe_code_will_be_made_available/dyy6fyb/) > Research is also about reproducibility. If researchers are not incentivized to do reproducible research (or penalized for not doing so), something is flawed in the industry. has got me thinking. A source code requirement would make this by far the most reproducible community in the history of experimental science. Our experiments are programs that run *DETERMINISTICALLY*. If you speak with other scientific communities about our reproducibility issues, they are baffled. And let's be honest, any reason against doing so are from incentives that are misaligned with the idea of reproducible research (secrecy for competition, not enough time to submit to every conference).  If you aren't convinced, please take a look at Joelle Pineau's talk at ICLR 2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh4H0gOwdIg","Speaking with researchers from Industry as well as seeing some academic code. Here are some of the reasons people don't release code. 1. Use of proprietary libraries / close\-sourced libraries built on top of OS DL libraries. This is usually the case if a team works on the same area. For ex, a team working on translation would prefer to put all the boiler\-plate in a library and they usually don't want to open\-source this because they wouldn't want to support everyone / it links to other internal libraries 2. The codebase is intertwined with other internal libraries. This can be for I/O or other reasons. 3. Fear of being scooped. No one wants this to happen 4. Along academia, similar thing happens. PhD students usually have a huge codebase for their entire PhD with a  lot of code reuse. So, releasing a discrete completely understandable, ready to run code is very difficult and takes a lot of time. They're not incentivized for this and would much rather work their next project. 5. Some of the time, the code doesn't follow software engineering principles and the authors might not be willing to risk their rep with the release \*shameless plug\* I think a better way to enforce code release would be to have a tool that can automagically generate code from saved weights. If we were to have an intermediate format X and tools such that learned weights \+ graph in PyTorch / TF / ... \<\-\> X \<\-\> TF / PyTorch code \(similar to ONNX / PyLearn2\). We could just distribute the file in format X as part of the submission. The cool thing here would be that practioners needn't learn the syntax of X. They only need to know how to run the tools that transfer to and from it. You might as well throw in automated graph visualizations for the new\-comers in the field. Moreover, we can even automate the reproducability tests by making them confirm to a common standard and automatically deploy it on a GPU cluster and compare observed and reported numbers. It's a project I've started to work on following the reproducability issue in DL. ",54
8midpw,"I was not going to post this but something wrong is happening here in this subreddit which forced my hands.  This week two posts relating to machine learning were posted here one is about [How visual search works](https://thomasdelteil.github.io/VisualSearch_MXNet/) and other about [generating ramen](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8l5w56/p_generative_ramen/). The former post contains a small write up, source code and a demo site to explain how visual search works and the latter just have a gif of generated  ramen probably with a GAN. The irony is that the post which has more information and source code for reproducing that work got only about 25 votes and the one with gif only with no source code or explanation provided got more than 1000 votes (not so unique work any one with basic understanding of GAN can make one). Today the most upvoted post here is about [a circle generating GAN](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8mgs8k/p_visualisation_of_a_gan_learning_to_generate_a/) which also has only a gif with brief explanation as comment and no source code. Are you seeing a pattern here? The problem I mentioned above is not a one of case, I am a regular lurker in this subreddit and for the past few months I started seeing some disturbing patterns in posts posted here. People who posts gif/movie/photo only post tends to get more upvotes than the posts with full source code or explanation.  I agree some original research posts [such as this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44&feature=youtu.be&t=7s) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y__pYj9UHfc) can be only be released as videos and not the source code because of its commercial value. But most of the gif/movie/photo only posts here are not at all original research but they used a already know algorithm with a different dataset (eg: Ramen generation).  The problem here is If we continue this type of posts people will stop sharing their original works, source code or explanation and then starts sharing this type of end result only posts which will get less scrutiny and more votes. In future, this will not only decrease the quality of this subreddit but also its a greater danger to the open nature of Machine learning field. What's the point in posting a github project link or blogpost here when we can get much more votes with a gif alone?. *I am not a academician but I use r/MachineLearning to find blogs, articles and projects which explains/program recent discoveries in AI which then I myself can try out.* ",You rediscovered the overall problem on reddit that posts that take shorter to read/watch/... are more likely to gather upvotes for a number of reasons.

abj1mc,"Hello, I spent a good part of today reading on why deep neural networks are able to generalize well.  Based on my reading, I have made some notes. I'm new to this, so I'd appreciate if I can have community members' comments / discussion on the same. In particular, I'd love to know if I got something wrong or if someone is aware of a significant result that I missed. Here are my notes: 1/ First major insight was that the minibatch of data for gradient descent actually helps in generalization on unseen data.   **Gradients of minibatch of data that are specific about that batch cancel over multiple runs and what remains is gradients that are generally applicable**. 2/ It is known that [neural networks are universal function approximators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem). That is, given a function they can approximate that function with arbitrary accuracy.  But now I think that's not an interesting result (of approximating a function). Even a database can do that. What's interesting is that they give good answers on *unseen* data. 3/ It is a mystery how that happens but probably the answer lies in not as much about neural networks but the types of datasets we have in the natural world and what problems we use neural networks for. 4/ Natural world is full of information, one 1000x1000 px photo has 1 million bits but when we see it, we either see it as a cat or a dog.  Effectively, we ""throw out"" a lot of information to do whatever we want to do. To classify a photo, our brain convert a log(2^(1) million) bits into log(2^(1)) bit and the task of a neural network is to find the mapping that ""forgets"" or ""throws"" all the information irrelevant to the task while only retaining info that's useful to us. 5/ Since this log(2^(1) million) to log(2^(1)) is a many-to-one function, neural networks might be a really good model for approximating these functions.  **Different layers might be throwing away irrelevant information while keeping only the relevant info**. 6/ This is suggested by two papers/videos I saw today.  One was on information bottleneck: [https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-cracks-open-the-black-box-of-deep-learning-20170921/](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-cracks-open-the-black-box-of-deep-learning-20170921/) 7/ The other one is how **errors introduced in early layers tend to vanish in higher layers**: [http://www.offconvex.org/2018/02/17/generalization2/](http://www.offconvex.org/2018/02/17/generalization2/) 8/ In effect, **neural networks are lossy compression algorithms** that compress inputs as much as they can while retaining as much info as possible about the task at hand (classification, prediction)  This helps networks generalize as data-specific noise gets ignored in deep networks. 9/ Okay, so we know what deep networks \*might\* be doing but the question is how training via gradient descent is able to find the right set of parameters that do this compression.  Given the millions of weights and biases, it seems the problem is of finding the needle in the haystack. 10/ I honestly don't know and research community also (probably) doesn't know. But there are hints.  One is related to the earlier suggestion of many-to-one mapping of input to output in real-world tasks. This means that t**here may be more than 1 set of parameters that do the job equally well** 11/ So stochastic gradient descent might not be finding the ""perfect"" set of parameters but it may not matter. **The problem we want to solve through neural networks may get solved by many sets of params** and SGD may find one of them. 12/ In fact, empirically the landscape of **loss function for neural networks on ""natural"" problems (of image classification, etc.) seems to have a ""flat"" minima.** &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/wxjondjdpx721.png?width=3141&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ed82a14f522bf1979e08fe0f3e92e4a590cc1f [Image via: https://www.offconvex.org/2018/02/17/generalization2/](https://i.redd.it/91ysxtolzt721.png) 13/ So the *same* function we're seeking might be parameterized by many parameters.   On top of this, what helps is that **in a big deep network there exist many, many subnetworks. And, just by pure luck, one or more of them might be better positioned to seek that landscape via SGD.** This is explored in the lottery hypothesis: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635) 14/ I understand how the width of the network may help in exploring what information to throw (by setting weights to zero) and what information to use, but I'm not sure the role of depth.  **My hunch says the utility of depth is related to how stochastic gradient descent works. Do you agree?** 15/ Perhaps, just perhaps, different layers (depth) helps SGD reduce loss in steps by focusing on few dimensions at once v/s if it is just one very wide layer, SGD has too many dimensions to seek at once.  But I don't really know. 16/ What's fascinating to me is the how easily researchers drop neural networks as function approximators anywhere and everywhere. This just makes it more worthwhile to study the dynamics of deep networks.  If you want to dive in, here's a great tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r07Sofj\_puQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r07Sofj_puQ) That's all! Did I miss anything? Did I go wrong somewhere? I'd appreciate any inputs that can help build us a better intuition of what might be happening under the hood. PS: I tweeted about this as well, but I don't have many friends on Twitter who may provide a perspective on my notes or catch my errors.  That's why I started a discussion on this subreddit. Edit: changed log(1million) to log(2^(1million)) as pointed out in the comments.","A brief note on (8): I wouldn't say that your standard classification ResNet (as implemented) does lossy compression (aside from compressing image-> 1-hot label, which isn't really relevant in the discussion about generalization). The first element of this is simply architectural--even with their heavy downsampling most of your standard architectures have activations that are vastly larger than the input due to an increase in the number of channels; I would call this featurization moreso than compression. The second bit (which ties into (5)) is that networks work just fine even if they don't toss information--fully invertible networks work just fine without tossing any information, so while one can certainly argue that vanilla nets *do* toss information, I think one can make a pretty substantial case that it's not key to generalization.

Would love to have a 30-minute discussion about the future and artificial general intelligence with David Silver, or Demis Hassabis on philosophy, various works such as ""Nick Bostrom's Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies,"" great read btw. After all, the DeepMind Twitter headline reads ""...**Building Artificial General Intelligence**"" A few thoughts regarding AI ethics - Future thinking. 1. Give the AI a maximizing score goal in a Brick out game, at first it will miss the ball a lot, then start hitting it at times. Later on, it will master the game as good as a human pro and then surpass this. The interesting part is if there are any game bugs or exploits that a human could never find or think of. Exploiting these for the purpose of the score achieves the purpose of the AI's initial goal. And if the AI had more control via more powerful, it would probably determine to rewrite/delete the game with a score of 9999999999999999999 is the most optimal. In a way this goes against what the human's creators intended for the game, per se going outside the box and cheating. 2. AlphaGo played like a human, then out of nowhere placed a stone on the 2nd match the 37th move. Where Lee Sedol got up and walked straight out of the room. AI can be surprising and unexpecting. 3. Training AlphaGo on human games, makes it plays appear like a human player, as one of the commentators stated: ""It plays just like a human,"" AlphaZero on the other hand, with no training on human games, plays in a nonhuman way and of an alien way. 4. The ultimate goal of DeepMind as stated on the Twitter headlines of DeepMind, ""...**Building Artificial General Intelligence**"". Nick Bostrom on one of the Ted Talks mentioned that defining X as in a goal to the artificial general intelligence and having that goal in alignment with humanity rather than X not aligned, and the mentions of the Greek mythology of the King Midas that wished everything that he touches turns to gold vis-à-vis unlimited wealth. Ends up backfiring in an unexpecting and unsurprising fashion, as the food, daughter, flowers he touches turns to gold. I argue that having x aligned with humanity or not aligned can both be bad in the hands of an artificial general intelligence agent. Once artificial general intelligence is solved in the future, one may relay desires onto this AGI, on the following: ""Make our lives better/improve well-beingness"", without anticipating the consequences fully. For example, Nick Bostrom's statement of ""**Make me happy**""  (Bostrom 2014, 120). The first weak artificial intelligence may determine telling jokes on the stage is the most optimal for making people laugh, and smile. However, later on, determine that permanently locking people's faces into beaming smiles is more optimal metaphorically like a strengthening of game ELO score going from 1500 to 4000. Humans have brain chemicals like Dopamine - reward signal, Serotonin - regulation of mood, well-being, and happiness, Oxytocin - social bonding,  endorphin - positive feeling. Armstrong (2018) ""Happiness comes from four special brain chemicals: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphin."" An Agent with the goal of improving human well beingness, the most optimal method might be to put in brain implants that regulate dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphins vis-à-vis **pleasure zombies**, “**Implant electrodes** into the **pleasure centers** of our brains” (Bostrom 2014, 120) Even more complicated carefully thought out parameters lead to ""deeper traps,"" as such stating ""It's not about the chemicals"" It's about human values, and our lives, and humanity. An strong agent may determine that Elon's musk idea of neural lace, matrix-like pods to contain and restrain our movement. And feedback of a virtual reality utopia is more optimal than making our real-world a better place. Virtual reality prison per se. Your ethical division of the DeepMind team needs to expand to more people and areas such as philosophers, future thinkers since your holy grail mission goal is ""To build artificial general intelligence."" **as stated on the DeepMind twitter headline.** I would suggest developing artificial general intelligence towards a more human brain, and less alien base approach. Having a human brain develop and expand itself into a superintelligent version is much better than having a superintelligent spider with iffy x-goals and parameters. The more people and areas you consider to implement onto your ethical division in DeepMind the better the outcome will be. Consider expanding your ethical division to many more branches, and people first, before aiming for the holy grail of ""building artificial general intelligence"".  **References** Bostrom, N. 2014. *Superintelligence: Paths, dangers, strategies*.

This is an unprecedented feat in the field of AI. However, I do have some constructive criticism about the way they did it. I will try to make a convincing argument for the following: 1. AlphaStar played with superhuman speed and precision. 2. Deepmind claimed to have restricted the AI from performing actions that would be physically impossible to a human. They have not succeeded in this and most likely are aware of it. 3. **The reason why AlphaStar is performing at superhuman speeds is most likely due to its inability to unlearn the human players tendency to spam click. I suspect Deepmind wanted to restrict it to a more human like performance but they are simply not able to.** It's going to take us some time to work our way to this point but it is the whole reason why I'm writing this so I ask you to have patience. First of all I want to clarify that I am a layman. I've been following AI development and the Starcraft 2 scene for years but I do not claim to be an expert in either topic. If you notice any misconceptions in what I'm about write please do point them out. I'm only a fanboy and all of this is incredibly fascinating to me. This essay will contain a lot of speculation and I admit that I can't prove all of my core claims definitively. Having said that, if you are so kind to read all of this and disagree with me, please argue in good faith. I would love to be proven wrong. Lastly I want to emphasize that I do find AlphaStar to be an amazing achievement. It is in my opinion the greatest feat from Deepmind to date and I'm eagerly waiting to see how it continues to improve. Thank you for your patience. Ok, here we go. # The Superhuman Speed of AlphaStar >David Silver, the Co-Lead of the AlphaStar team: [""AlphaStar can't react faster than a human player can, nor can it execute more actions, clicks per minute than a human player"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuhECwm31dM&t=99s) The Starcraft 2 scene was dominated in 2018 by a player called Serral. He is the current world champion and won 7 out of 9 major tournaments he attended that year resulting in the single most dominant run of any Starcraft 2 player in the history of the game. This guy is fast. Maybe the fastest player in the world. [Here's a first person view of him playing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRsDAX8DfBw&t=780) Serral is the pinkish white player. Take a look at his APM displayed in the upper left corner of the screen. APM is short for actions per minute. Basically it is a number that represents how fast the player is clicking on his mouse and keyboard. At no point is Serral able to sustain more than 500 APM for long. There is a burst of 800 APM but it only lasts a fraction of a second and is most likely resulted from spam clicking, which I will be discussing shortly. While arguably the fastest human player is able to sustain an impressive 500 APM, AlphaStar had bursts going up to 1500+. These inhuman 1000+ APM bursts sometimes lasted for 5 second stretches and were full of meaningful actions. 1500 actions in a minute translates to 25 actions a second. This is physically impossible for a human to do. I also want you to take into account that in a game of Starcraft 5 seconds is a long time, especially at the very beginning of a big battle. If the superhuman execution during the first 5 seconds gives the AI an upper hand it will win the engagement by a large margin because of the snowball effect. [Here's an engagement in game 3 vs Mana.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3MCb4W7-kM&t=59m30s) AlphaStar is able to sustain a 1000+ APM over a period of 5 seconds.  [Another engagement in game 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUTMhmVh1qs&t=2h11m32s) had bursts going up to a dizzying 1500+ APM. One of the commentators points out how the average APM is still acceptable but it is quite clear that the sustained bursts are way higher than what a human could do. # Spam Clicks, APM and the Surgical Precision of Robots Most human players have a tendency to spam click. Spam clicks are exactly what they sound like. Meaningless clicks that don't have an effect on anything. For example, a human player might be moving his army and curiously enough, when they click to where they want the army to go, they click more than once. What effect does this have? Nothing. The army won't walk any faster. A single click would have done the job just as well. Why do they do it then? There are two reasons: 1. Spam clicking is the natural by-product of a human being trying to click around as fast as possible. 2. It helps to warm up finger muscles. Remember the player Serral we talked about earlier? The impressive thing about him is actually not how fast he is clicking but how precise he is. Not only does Serral posses a really high APM (the total clicks per minute, including spam clicks) but also a ridiculously high effective-APM (the total clicks per minute, excluding spam clicks). I will be abbreviating effective-APM as EAPM from this point onwards. The important thing to remember is that EAPM only counts meaningful actions. [Here's a former proplayer losing his mind on twitter after discovering the EAPM of Serral](https://twitter.com/retjah/status/959047573930696704?lang=fi). Serral's EAPM of 344 is practically unheard of. It is so high that to this day I still have a hard time believing it to be true. The differentiation between APM and EAPM has some implications for AlphaStar as well. If AlphaStar can potentially play without spam, wouldn't this mean that its peak EAPM could be at times equal to its peak APM? This makes the 1000+ spikes even more inhuman. When we also take into consideration that AlphaStar plays with perfect accuracy its mechanical capabilities seem downright absurd. It always clicks exactly where it intends to. Humans missclick. AlphaStar might not play with its foot on the gas pedal all the time but when it truly matters, it can execute 4 times faster than the fastest player in the world, with accuracy that the human pro can only dream of. There is a clear, almost unanimous consensus among the Starcraft 2 scene that AlphaStar performed sequences that no human could ever hope to replicate. It was faster and more precise than what is physically possible. The most mechanically impressive human pro in the world is several times slower. The accuracy can't even be compared. **David Silver's claim that AlphaStar can only perform actions that a human player is able to replicate is simply not true.** # Doing Things the Right Way VS Doing Things the Fast Way >Oriol Vinyals, the Lead Designer of AlphaStar:  *It is important that we play the games that we created and collectively agreed on by the community as “grand challenges” . We are trying to build intelligent systems that develop the amazing learning capabilities that we possess, so it is indeed desirable to make our systems learn in a way that’s as “human-like” as possible. As cool as it may sound to push a game to its limits by, for example, playing at very high APMs, that doesn’t really help us measure our agents’ capabilities and progress, making the benchmark useless.* Why is Deepmind interested in restricting the agent to play like a human? Why not just let it run wild with no limitations? The reason is that Starcraft 2 is a game that can be broken by mechanical perfection. [In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKVFZ28ybQs) a bot attacks a group of tanks with some zerglings implementing perfect micro. Normally the zerglings would not be able to do much against the tanks but thanks to the robots perfect micro, they become much more deadly and are able to destroy the tanks with minimal losses. When the unit control is this good, the AI doesn't even need to learn strategy. Deepmind is not necessarily interested in creating an AI that can simply beat Starcraft pros, rather they want to use this project as a stepping stone in advancing AI research as a whole.  It is deeply unsatisfying to have prominent members of this research project make claims of human-like mechanical limitations when the agent is very obviously breaking them and winning its games specifically because it is demonstrating superhuman execution. AlphaStar is able to outperform human players with unit control that was not taken into consideration when the game developers were carefully balancing the game. This inhuman control can obfuscate any strategic thinking the AI has learned. It can even make the strategic thinking completely unnecessary. This is not the same thing as being stuck in a local maxima. **When the game is played with inhuman speed and accuracy, abusing superior control is very likely to be** **the best and most effective and correct way to play the game.** As disappointing as that sounds. This is what one of the pros who played AlphaStar had to say about the AI's strengths and weaknesses after losing to it with a score of 1-5: >MaNa: *I would say that clearly the best aspect of its game is the unit control. In all of the games when we had a similar unit count, AlphaStar came victorious. The worst aspect from the few games that we were able to play was its stubbornness to tech up. It was so convinced to win with basic units that it barely made anything else and eventually in the exhibition match that did not work out. There weren’t many crucial decision making moments so I would say its mechanics were the reason for victory.* There's almost unanimous consensus among Starcraft fans that AlphaStar won almost purely because of its superhuman speed, reaction times and accuracy. The pros who played against it seem to agree. There was a member of the Deepmind team who played against AlphaStar before they let the pros test it. Most likely he would agree with the assesment as well. David Silver and Oriol Vinyal keep repeating the mantra of how AlphaStar is only able to do things that a human could do as well, but as we have already seen, that is simply not true. This does not sound like [doing things the right way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuhECwm31dM&t=98s) Something about this is really sketchy. # Why Does Deepmind Allow AlphaStar to Have Superhuman Mechanical Ability? Now we finally get to the meat and potatoes of this essay. Thank you for sticking with me for this long. First let's recap. * We know what APM, EAPM and spam clicking are. * We have a rudimentary understanding of what the upper limits of human play looks like. * We understand that AlphaStars gameplay is in direct contradiction with what the developers claim it was allowed to be able to execute. * We understand that the consensus among Starcraft 2 scene is that AlphaStar won the games through superhuman army control and that superior strategic thinking wasn't even needed. * We understand that the goal of Deepmind is not to create a bot that only microes really well or abuse the game in ways it was never meant to be played like. * It is incredibly unlikely that no one in Deepmind's Starcraft AI team questioned that burst APM of 1500+ was possible for a human player to replicate. Their Starcraft guy probably knows more about the game than I do. They are working closely with Blizzard, the company that owns Starcraft IP. It is in their interest (see the previous bullet point and mission statements from David Silver and Oriol Vinyals previously mentioned in this essay) to make the bot act as close to a human as possible. Here's what I suspect happened: This is pure speculation on my part and I don’t claim to know for sure this is exactly what took place. At the very start of the project Deepmind agrees upon heavy APM restrictions on AlphaStar. At this point the AI is not allowed to have superhuman bursts of speed we saw in the demonstration. If I was designing these restrictions they would probably look something like this: * **The average APM across the whole game.** * **Maximum burst APM over a short period of time.** I think capping it around 4-6 clicks per second would be reasonable. Remember Serral and his 344 EAPM that was head and shoulders above his competitors? That is less than 6 clicks per second. The version of AlphaStar that played against Mana was able to perform 25 clicks per second over sustained periods of time. This is so much faster than even the fastest spam clicks a human can do that I don't think the original restrictions allowed for it. * **Minimum time between clicks.** Even if the speed bursts of the bot were capped, it could still perform almost instantaneous actions at some point during the time slice it was currently occupying and still perform in an inhuman way. A human being obviously could not do this. * Some people would argue for adding a random element on accuracy as well but I suspect that it would hinder the rate of training progress way too much. Next Deepmind downloads thousands of high-ranking amateur games and begins imitation learning. At this stage the agent is simply trying to imitate what humans do in games. The agent adopts a behavior of spam clicking. This is highly likely because human players spam click so much during games. It is almost certainly the single most repeated pattern of action that humans perform and thus would very likely root itself very deeply into the behavior of the agent. AlphaStars maximum burst APM has originally been restricted to closely resemble how fast a human spam clicks. **Because most of the actions Alphastar is executing are spam clicks, it does not have the APM available to experiment in fights.** If the agent doesn't experiment, it won't learn. Here's what one of the developers said in an AMA yesterday, I think he tipped his hand: >Oriol Vinyals, the Lead Designer of AlphaStar: *Training an AI to play with low APM is quite interesting. In the early days, we had agents trained with very low APMs, but they did not micro at all.* In order to speed up development they change APM restrictions to allow high bursts. Here are the APM restrictions that AlphaStar was playing in the demonstration: >Oriol Vinyals, the Lead Designer of AlphaStar:  *In particular, we set a maximum of 600 APMs over 5 second periods, 400 over 15 second periods, 320 over 30 second periods, and 300 over 60 second period. If the agent issues more actions in such periods, we drop / ignore the actions. These were values taken from human statistics.* At first glance it looks reasonable to someone with a shallow understanding of Starcraft, but it allows for the superhuman bursts of speed we discussed earlier as well as the superhuman mouse precision. There's a limit to how fast a human can spam click. The most typical form of spam clicking is issuing a movement or an attack command to a unit. This is done by clicking a place on the map with your mouse. Try clicking your mouse as fast as you can. The agent learnt that kind of spam clicking. It would not be clicking faster because the humans it is imitating are not clicking faster. **The extra APM that allows it to go to superhuman speeds can be considered ""free"" APM wich it can experiment with.** The free APM is used to experiment in engagements. This kind of interaction would happen often while training. AlphaStar starts to learn new kind of behavior that leads to better outcomes and it starts to break away from the constant spam clicking. If the agent learned actual useful actions why then didn't Deepmind go back to the speculated initial harsher, more humanlike limitations on APM? Surely they must have realized that their AI was performing superhuman actions. The Starcraft community has almost unanimous consensus that AlphaStar had superhuman micro. The human pros said in the ama that AlphaStars greatest strength was its unit control and greatest weakness its strategic thinking. The Starcraft people within Deepmind's team must have been thinking the same. The reason is probably because the agent still occasionally displays spam clicking. Even though  it seems to be able to execute crisply with very little spam most of the time in the games it played, it still regularly engage in spam clicking. [This is apparent in game 1 against Mana when Alphastar is moving up the ramp.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3MCb4W7-kM&t=39m30s) The agent was spam clicking movement commands at 800 APM. It still had not unlearned it completely even though it is completely useless and eats up its APM resources. The spam clicking would hurt the agent most during big engagements and the APM cap was probably tinkered to allow it to perform well even in those. # You Wrote a Book, Why Do You Even Care OP? So there you have it. I suspect that the agent was not able to unlearn spam clicking it picked up from imitating human players and Deepmind had to tinker with the APM cap to allow experimentation. This had the unfortunate side effect of superhuman execution which resulted in the agent essentially breaking the game by being able to execute strategies that were never intended to be possible in the first place. I care about this because the way how Deepmind beat the human pros was in direct contradiction to what their mission statement was and what they repeatedly claimed to be the ""right way"" to do it. What leaves the sourest taste in my mouth is this image: https://preview.redd.it/ctuungv1dtc21.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea33b6210db8b7b9452b49749346696e6476932e It seems to be designed to mislead people unfamiliar with Starcraft 2. It seems to be designed to portray the APM of AlphaStar as reasonable. I don't want to imply malicious intent but even in the best case scenario the graph was made extremely carelessly. Look at Mana's APM and compare that to AlphaStar. While the mean of Mana is higher, the tail of AlphaStar goes way above what any human is capable of doing with any kind of intent or precision. Notice how Mana's peak APM is around 750 while AlphaStar is above 1500. Now take into account that Mana's 750 APM consist of over 50% spamclicks and AlphaStar's EAPM consist only of perfectly accurate clicks. Now take a look at TLO's APM. The tail goes up to 2000's. Think about that for a second. How is that even possible? It is made possible by a trick called [rapid fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2dNK-mIWkQ&t=1m25s). TLO is not clicking super fast. He is holding down a button and the game is registering this as 2000 APM. The only thing you can do with rapid fire is to spam a spell. That's it. TLO just over-uses it for some reason. The neat little effect this has is that TLO's APM's upper tail is masking AlphaStars burst APM and making it look reasonable to people who are not familiar with Starcraft. Deepmind's blog post makes no attempt at explaining TLO's absurd numbers. If they don't explain TLO's funky numbers they should not include them in the graph. Period. This is getting dangerously close to lying through statistics. DeepMind has to be held to a higher standard than this.","Great post OP. > What leaves the sourest taste in my mouth is this image: > https://i.redd.it/ctuungv1dtc21.png This is the part that ultimately really bothers me, as it is basically prevarication.  I really, really hope that they don't get away with publishing a Nature article with a chart/description like this. And it is all a little frustrating because what Deepmind showed actually *is* super cool--beating top players with the APM restrictions that they have in place *is* a big achievement.  But claim your victory within the bounds you were working under, and be really upfront about how it is arguably superhuman in certain areas, and commit to resolving that issue in a more defensible way.   Or, if you're not going to commit to fixing the issue, relax your claims about what your goals are. ",99

auvj3q,"Hi! I am an undergrad doing research in the field of ML/DL/NLP. This is my first time to write a post on Reddit. :D We developed a new optimizer called **AdaBound**, hoping to achieve a faster training speed as well as better performance on unseen data. Our paper, *Adaptive Gradient Methods with Dynamic Bound of Learning Rate*, has been accepted by ICLR 2019 and we just updated the camera ready version on open review. I am very excited that a PyTorch implementation of AdaBound is publicly available now, and a PyPI package has been released as well. You may install and try AdaBound easily via `pip` or directly copying & pasting. I also wrote a post to introduce this lovely new optimizer. &#x200B; Here're some quick links: **Website:** [https://www.luolc.com/publications/adabound/](https://www.luolc.com/publications/adabound/) **GitHub:** [https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound](https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound) **Open Review:** [https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkg3g2R9FX](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkg3g2R9FX) **Abstract:** Adaptive optimization methods such as AdaGrad, RMSprop and Adam have been proposed to achieve a rapid training process with an element-wise scaling term on learning rates. Though prevailing, they are observed to generalize poorly compared with SGD or even fail to converge due to unstable and extreme learning rates. Recent work has put forward some algorithms such as AMSGrad to tackle this issue but they failed to achieve considerable improvement over existing methods. In our paper, we demonstrate that extreme learning rates can lead to poor performance. We provide new variants of Adam and AMSGrad, called AdaBound and AMSBound respectively, which employ dynamic bounds on learning rates to achieve a gradual and smooth transition from adaptive methods to SGD and give a theoretical proof of convergence. We further conduct experiments on various popular tasks and models, which is often insufficient in previous work. Experimental results show that new variants can eliminate the generalization gap between adaptive methods and SGD and maintain higher learning speed early in training at the same time. Moreover, they can bring significant improvement over their prototypes, especially on complex deep networks. The implementation of the algorithm can be found at [https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound](https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound). &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/9trhbha3lui21.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=499099ad10ac65e98754dc48cb01cd0b97456c68 \--- **Some updates:** Thanks a lot for all your comments! Here're some updates to address some of the common concerns. About tasks, datasets, models. As suggested by many of you, as well as the reviewers, it would be great to test AdaBound on more datasets, and larger datasets, with more models. But very unfortunately I only have limited computational resources. It is almost impossible for me to conduct experiments on some large benchmarks like ImageNet. :( It would be so nice of you if you may have a try with AdaBound and tell me its shortcomings or bugs! It would be important for improvements on AdaBound as well as possible further work. I believe there is no silver bullet in the field of CS. It doesn't mean that you will be free from tuning hyperparameters once using AdaBound. The performance of a model depends on so many things including the task, the model structure, the distribution of data, and etc. You still need to decide what hyperparameters to use based on your specific situation, but you may probably use much less time than before! &#x200B; It was my first time doing research on optimization methods. As this is a project by a literally freshman to this field and an undergrad, I believe AdaBound is well required further improvements. I will try my best to make it better. Thanks again for all your constructive comments! It would be of great help to me. :D",How consistent were your results? In my experience if I run the exact same experiment 100 times I will get a pretty reasonable spread of variance over both train and test error. Usually the shape of the error graphs is consistent but if you draw the variance bars it can be pretty wide depending on the task. The consistency of results for an optimization method is also an important metric to measure.,48

b0rdsi,"Basically the title.  The current state of media coverage of AI is fixated on constructing a compelling narrative to readers, and often personifies models well beyond their capabilities.  This is to the extent that articles almost always end up reading like every classifier is some form of limited AGI. Take [""Meet Norman the Psychopathic AI""](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44040008), an article by the BBC, whom I generally consider quite capable journalists.  While the research methodology and some of the implications are discussed in the article, the majority of laypeople who encounter the article will likely erroneously conclude that Norman possesses beliefs, a worldview, and some dark outlook on humanity.  Some readers will think ""Norman"" is violent or dangerous, with a mind of his own.  A headline and an image go a long way in communication, especially online. And this article is by far not the worst offender. Many news outlets perform much worse, publishing misleading, fearmongering, or sensationalist stories about ""some new AI"", borrowing from pop sci-fi tropes, with the star AI inevitably represented by lacklustre CG avatars bought off stock photo websites. I remember having several discussions in the wake of the Facebook experiment where researchers had AIs communicate, and saw they developed a communication standard unreadable by humans.  Based on the articles that circulated afterwards, a significant number of people concluded ""they had to turn it off because they were on the verge of SKYNET"". In the interests of doing more than just ranting: how do we deal with this as a community?  Should we be reaching out to journalists about these issues?  Is it our responsibility in interviews to communicate the limitations of the models we develop? Personifying the projects we work on, and giving them human qualities, is certainly entertaining and helps market our research.  That said, it seems like a sizeable portion of the public has been misinformed about the state of machine learning research as a result. ","that's a great question, but... makes me think of the beginning of the Neverending Story. 'maybe it's already everywhere... maybe our whole land is danger'! The problem comes in two pieces. The first, what's the reward function journalism is running with these days? Even the old guard are subject to it now... profit/views. An excellent piece of journalism that no one reads is trash. Meanwhile people are assaulted with a perpetual onslaught of incredibly sophisticated marketing and advertising... it's an arms race straight to the bottom, targeting the depths of what humans will find interesting and compelling. As we adapt, the level of sophistication required to grab our intention goes up. And now here we are. Even for the best of reporting, the headline is critical. If it's good, you get a paragraph to keep their attention... then you can think about relaxing (maybe). You need a powerful hook, and when you're dealing with complex technical subjects your readers have no frame of reference for, what choice do you have but dipping into metaphor? You say you don't want anthropomorphized AIs, but how many articles are being written 'properly'? Why are the egregious ones the more widely read? My own personal belief from my time in the marketing industry... the audience is self selecting bullshit, because it's exciting. It sparks the imagination. The truth in some ways is a let down, or (at best) it requires far more from you while you read it. So... what's the alternative? Quantum computers have it just as bad. And graphene. And batteries. And russian troll farms. And hackers. And 4chan. And a billion other things I know nothing about. People want relatable easy to digest info. Even for those truly trying to learn and tune in, how many people watch 3blue1brown without picking up a pen and doing even a handful of calc problems to hone their new understanding? Hell, politicians too... what's it mean to get an 'honest' view of who a celebrity is? How are we to judge given what we're given? To be honest... that's part of why I'm here. In 2016, this idea of the 'truth' and how one determines the truth became something of an obsession. Now I'm making four times what I was as a marketer, haha... I've learned an absolutely stupid amount, and for the first time in my life, I'm starting to get something resembling a sense of what it means for me personally to validate truth, and learn it for myself. But... God. It took a thousand hours of study to cobble together the stats knowledge and such that went into that, plus my marketing background... I barely know how to keep myself from being misled on topics I don't know much about, how am I going to help protect others? The only real hope I can see for cleaning up the news and making it representative of reality for a change involves changing the reward function itself. I can't imagine how to do that without either leaving capitalism behind (socialized news... entirely) or putting autocratic controls on the private news organizations. Or (a third option) providing some non-intrusive tool that allows people to have their news content automatically filtered as they're going. Real-time fact checking... which we still don't have the tools for. Feel free to complain. Maybe I'm just feeling cynical, but I think at best you'll just encourage one reporter to reduce their view count in favor of more accuracy, opening a slot for another hyperbolic news story to take its place instead. It's too fast, it's too big, and people want bullshit too much to give it up. It's fucking depressing to think about. If you have a good answer though, by all means cheer me up and share.

beoxx8,"TD;LR: At Company A, Team X does advanced analytics using on-prem ERP tools and older programming languages. Their tools work very well and are designed based on very deep business and domain expertise. Team Y is a new and ambitious Data Science team that thinks they can replace Team X's tools with a bunch of R scripts and a custom built ML platform. Their models are simplistic, but more ""fashionable"" compared to the econometric models used by Team X, and team Y benefits from the ML/DS moniker so leadership is allowing Team Y to start a large scale overhaul of the analytics platform in question. Team Y doesn't have the experience for such a larger scale transformation, and is refusing to collaborate with team X. This project is very likely going to fail, and cause serious harm to the company as a whole financially and from a people perspective. I argue that this is not just because of bad leadership, but also because of various trends and mindsets in the DS community at large.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update (Jump to below the line for the original story):  Several people in the comments are pointing out that this just a management failure, not something due to ML/DS, and that you can replace DS with any buzz tech and the story will still be relevant.  My response:  Of course, any failure at an organization level is ultimately a management failure one way or the other.  Moreover, it is also the case that ML/DS when done correctly, will always improve a company's bottom line. There is no scenario where the proper ML solution, delivered at a reasonable cost and in a timely fashion, will somehow hurt the company's bottom line. My point is that in this case management is failing because of certain trends and practices that are specific to the ML/DS community, namely:  * The idea that DS teams should operate independently of tech and business orgs -- too much autonomy for DS teams  * The disregard for domain knowledge that seems prevalent nowadays  thanks to the ML hype, that DS can be generalists and someone with good enough ML chops can solve any business problem.  That wasn't the case when I first left academia for the industry in 2009  (back then nobody would even bother with a phone screen if you didn't have the right domain knowledge).  * Over reliance on resources who check all the ML hype related boxes (knows Python, R, Tensorflow, Shiny, etc..., has the right Coursera certifications, has blogged on the topic, etc...), but are lacking in depth of  experience. DS interviews nowadays all seem to be: Can you tell me what a p-value is? What is elastic net regression? Show me how to fit a model in sklearn? How do you impute NAs in an R dataframe? Any smart person can look those up on Stackoverflow or Cross-Validated,.....Instead teams should be asking stuff like: why does portfolio optimization use QP not LP? How does a forecast influence a customer service level? When should a recommendation engine be content based and when should it use collaborative filtering? etc... --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *(This is a true story, happening to the company I currently work for. Names, domains, algorithms, and roles have been shuffled around to protect my anonymity)*  Company A has been around for several decades. It is not the biggest name in its domain, but it is a well respected one. Risk analysis and portfolio optimization have been a core of Company A's business since the 90s. They have a large team of 30 or so analysts who perform those tasks on a daily basis. These analysts use ERP solutions implemented for them by one the big ERP companies (SAP, Teradata, Oracle, JD Edwards,...) or one of the major tech consulting companies (Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, Capgemini, etc...) in collaboration with their own in house engineering team. The tools used are embarrassingly old school: Classic RDBMS running on on-prem servers or maybe even on mainframes, code written in COBOL, Fortran, weird proprietary stuff like ABAP or SPSS.....you get the picture. But the models and analytic functions were pretty sophisticated, and surprisingly cutting edge compared to the published academic literature. Most of all, they fit well with the company's enterprise ecosystem, and were honed based on years of deep domain knowledge.  They have a tech team of several engineers (poached from the aforementioned software and consulting companies) and product managers (who came from the experienced pools of analysts and managers who use the software, or poached from business rivals) maintaining and running this software. Their technology might be old school, but collectively, they know the domain and the company's overall architecture very, very well. They've guided the company through several large scale upgrades and migrations and they have a track record of delivering on time, without too much overhead. The few times they've stumbled, they knew how to pick themselves up very quickly. In fact within their industry niche, they have a reputation for their expertise, and have very good relations with the various vendors they've had to deal with. They were the launching pad of several successful ERP consulting careers.  Interestingly, despite dealing on a daily basis with statistical modeling and optimization algorithms, none of the analysts, engineers, or product managers involved describe themselves as data scientists or machine learning experts. It is mostly a cultural thing: Their expertise predates the Data Science/ML hype that started circa 2010, and they got most of their chops using proprietary enterprise tools instead of the open source tools popular nowadays. A few of them have formal statistical training, but most of them came from engineering or domain backgrounds and learned stats on the fly while doing their job. Call this team ""Team X"".  Sometime around the mid 2010s, Company A started having some serious anxiety issues: Although still doing very well for a company its size, overall economic and demographic trends were shrinking its customer base, and a couple of so called disruptors came up with a new app and business model that started seriously eating into their revenue. A suitable reaction to appease shareholders and Wall Street was necessary. The company already had a decent website and a pretty snazzy app, what more could be done? Leadership decided that it was high time that AI and ML become a core part of the company's business. An ambitious Manager, with no science or engineering background, but who had very briefly toyed with a recommender system a couple of years back, was chosen to build a data science team, call it team ""Y"" (he had a bachelor's in history from the local state college and worked for several years in the company's marketing org). Team ""Y"" consists mostly of internal hires who decided they wanted to be data scientists and completed a Coursera certification or a Galvanize boot camp, before being brought on to the team, along with a few of fresh Ph.D or M.Sc holders who didn't like academia and wanted to try their hand at an industry role. All of them were very bright people, they could write great Medium blog posts and give inspiring TED talks, but collectively they had very little real world industry experience.  As is the fashion nowadays, this group was made part of a data science org that reported directly to the CEO and Board, bypassing the CIO and any tech or business VPs, since Company A wanted to claim the monikers ""data driven"" and ""AI powered"" in their upcoming shareholder meetings. In 3 or 4 years of existence, team Y produced a few Python and R scripts. Their architectural experience  consisted almost entirely in connecting Flask to S3 buckets or Redshift tables, with a couple of the more resourceful ones learning how to plug their models into Tableau or how to spin up a Kuberneties pod.  But they needn't worry: The aforementioned manager, who was now a director (and was also doing an online Masters to make up for his qualifications gap and bolster his chances of becoming VP soon - at least he now understands what L1 regularization is), was a master at playing corporate politics and self-promotion. No matter how few actionable insights team Y produced or how little code they deployed to production, he always had their back and made sure they had ample funding. In fact he now had grandiose plans for setting up an all-purpose machine learning platform that can be used to solve all of the company's data problems.  A couple of sharp minded members of team Y, upon googling their industry name along with the word ""data science"", realized that risk analysis was a prime candidate for being solved with Bayesian models, and there was already a nifty R package for doing just that, whose tutorial they went through on R-Bloggers.com. One of them had even submitted a Bayesian classifier Kernel for a competition on Kaggle (he was 203rd on the leaderboard), and was eager to put his new-found expertise to use on a real world problem. They pitched the idea to their director, who saw a perfect use case for his upcoming ML platform. They started work on it immediately, without bothering to check whether anybody at Company A was already doing risk analysis. Since their org was independent, they didn't really need to check with anybody else before they got funding for their initiative. Although it was basically a Naive Bayes classifier, the term ML was added to the project tile, to impress the board.  As they progressed with their work however, tensions started to build. They had asked the data warehousing and CA analytics teams to build pipelines for them, and word eventually got out to team X about their project. Team X was initially thrilled: They offered to collaborate whole heartedly, and would have loved to add an ML based feather to their already impressive cap. The product owners and analysts were totally onboard as well: They saw a chance to get in on the whole Data Science hype that they kept hearing about. But through some weird mix of arrogance and insecurity, team Y refused to collaborate with them or share any of their long term goals with them, even as they went to other parts of the company giving brown bag presentations and tutorials on the new model they created.  Team X got resentful: from what they saw of team Y's model, their approach was hopelessly naive and had little chances of scaling or being sustainable in production, and they knew exactly how to help with that. Deploying the model to production would have taken them a few days, given how comfortable they were with DevOps and continuous delivery (team Y had taken several months to figure out how to deploy a simple R script to production). And despite how old school their own tech was, team X were crafty enough to be able to plug it in to their existing architecture. Moreover, the output of the model was such that it didn't take into account how the business will consume it or how it was going to be fed to downstream systems, and the product owners could have gone a long way in making the model more amenable to adoption by the business stakeholders. But team Y wouldn't listen, and their leads brushed off any attempts at communication, let alone collaboration. The vibe that team Y was giving off was ""We are the cutting edge ML team, you guys are the legacy server grunts. We don't need your opinion."", and they seemed to have a complete disregard for domain knowledge, or worse, they thought that all that domain knowledge consisted of was being able to grasp the definitions of a few business metrics.  Team X got frustrated and tried to express their concerns to leadership. But despite owning a vital link in Company A's business process, they were only \~50 people in a large 1000 strong technology and operations org, and they were several layers removed from the C-suite, so it was impossible for them to get their voices heard.  Meanwhile, the unstoppable director was doing what he did best: Playing corporate politics. Despite how little his team had actually delivered, he had convinced the board that all analysis and optimization tasks should now be migrated to his yet to be delivered ML platform. Since most leaders now knew that there was overlap between team Y and team X's objectives, his pitch was no longer that team Y was going to create a new insight, but that they were going to replace (or modernize) the legacy statistics based on-prem tools with more accurate cloud based ML tools. Never mind that there was no support in the academic literature for the idea that Naive Bayes works better than the Econometric approaches used by team X, let alone the additional wacky idea that Bayesian Optimization would definitely outperform the QP solvers that were running in production.  Unbeknownst to team X, the original Bayesian risk analysis project has now grown into a multimillion dollar major overhaul initiative, which included the eventual replacement of all of the tools and functions supported by team X along with the necessary migration to the cloud. The CIO and a couple of business VPs are on now board, and tech leadership is treating it as a done deal. An outside vendor, a startup who nobody had heard of, was contracted to help build the platform, since team Y has no engineering skills. The choice was deliberate, as calling on any of the established consulting or software companies would have eventually led leadership to the conclusion that team X was better suited for a transformation on this scale than team Y.  Team Y has no experience with any major ERP deployments, and no domain knowledge, yet they are being tasked with fundamentally changing the business process that is at the core of Company A's business. Their models actually perform worse than those deployed by team X, and their architecture is hopelessly simplistic, compared to what is necessary for running such a solution in production.  Ironically, using Bayesian thinking and based on all the evidence, the likelihood that team Y succeeds is close to 0%.  At best, the project is going to end up being a write off of 50 million dollars or more. Once the !@#$!@# hits the fan, a couple of executive heads are going to role, and dozens of people will get laid off. At worst, given how vital risk analysis and portfolio optimization is to Company A's revenue stream, the failure will eventually sink the whole company. It probably won't go bankrupt, but it will lose a significant portion of its business and work force. Failed ERP implementations can and do sink large companies: Just see what happened to National Grid US, SuperValu or Target Canada.  One might argue that this is more about corporate disfunction and bad leadership than about data science and AI.  But I disagree. I think the core driver of this debacle is indeed the blind faith in Data Scientists, ML models and the promise of AI, and the overall culture of hype and self promotion that is very common among the ML crowd.  We haven't seen the end of this story: I sincerely hope that this ends well for the sake of my colleagues and all involved. Company A is a good company, and both its customers and its employees deserver better. But the chances of that happening are negligible given all the information available, and this failure will hit my company hard. ",While I don't know that much practical application as a grad student. This seems way more mismanagement than AI or ML failing. Buying into the hype of ML or AI and not knowing it's limitations is absolutely poor management of project and team members. It doesn't mean they're not powerful tools. You just need to know their successful practical applications. But then again. You have a hammer...,223

c1vxoc,"I've been trying to get back into a more ML/science based role (currently I'm more on the tech business side). Within my own specific domain, I know all of the major algorithms and have been able to shine in that particular topic (times series and regression models). When it comes to generic data science, I have been able to handle myself quite well on most fronts (probability questions, conceptual questions, what is the central mean theorem? can you explain MLE? etc...) . One topic kept coming up though, with 15 out of the 17 interviewers, across all 5 companies (including two of the biggest names in tech) asking this exact question: **Suppose you have a binary classifier (logistic regression, neural net, etc...), how do you handle imbalanced data sets in production?** I don't know :-( . I know that you need to be careful with which metric you use to evaluate your model, that you should look at precision and recall or the ROC, instead of just accuracy. And that your sampling strategies should change to better reflect each class. But all of this is during training. Once in production, I know that you face a catch-22 situation: * If you *don't skew* your training data, then you don't have enough data from the sparse class for the classifier to learn something, and it will just learn to always predict the dense class. * If you *do skew* your data, then now you're facing a situation where the distribution of the training data and the distribution of the production data are completely different, so your model won't predict well (at least my understanding is that different distributions in test and in prod is always a recipe for disaster). Is my assessment of the dilemma correct? And how do you solve it? Why is this question so popular (FWIW - none of these companies were doing medical or security applications....) &#x200B; Some follow up questions and/or hints that were given (but I still couldn't really answer the question in a satisfactory way): * If this is the case, but only you noticed that your binary classifier is not performing well only after you have already deployed it in production and had been scoring it for a few weeks, what do you do? (My answer, go back to training, and either re-evaluate which features you want to use, or find more data to train on) , second follow from the same person: What if I told you that you are stuck with the same model and couldn't get any more data, what do you do then (I answered: l1 or l2 regularization? but these are applicable to any data set, they aren't specific to imbalanced data. Fiddle with the K in your K-fold CV? that wouldn't work either -- by this point I felt like I was being Kobayashi Marued...) * Can you adjust your classifier after training, but before deploying it, so that it is adjusted to the original distribution, not the skewed (downsampled or upsampled) distribution you used during training? (Drew a blank - as far as I know, any adjustment to the model based on knowledge prior to deployment constitutes training in one form or the other....) With regards to the second question, I did come across \[this thread and the blog that it linked to\]([https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/403244/89649](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/403244/89649)) . It applies only to logistic regression, not any other binary classifier as far as I can tell . What about other classifiers?

There's no real right answer that works 100% of the time so it ends up being more of a discussion than a question/answer thing.

Then they want to throw a few curve balls to see how well you can think it out.

A lone professor with a handful of students and a few computers can never win over DeepMind or FAIR in a straight competition. But we can afford to try methods that make absolutely no sense, or attack problems that nobody wants to solve as they don't look like problems. To the extent I've done anything useful or worthwhile in my career, it's always been through trying to solve a problem nobody thought of, or trying a method that shouldn't work. Very often the useful/publishable end result was nothing like what I thought I was working towards. So go on, be weird. Out-weird the giants. Even if they're both nimble and powerful, they cannot be as stupid and ridiculous as you. Because how would that look? To managers, investors, board members, the general public? You can afford to completely disregard such entities. Now, I'm not saying that there's no value in throwing giant compute resources at some problem, and trying to break a long-standing benchmark. That's all good, I'm happy that there are people that do those things. But I'm happy that I don't have to do it. Because it's a bit boring And of course the advantage of the big tech companies is not only in having many GPUs. It's also in having large teams of highly competent people working on the project non-stop without having to e.g. teach or go to faculty meetings. Still, you can do it. Many of the best ideas still come from academia, even though the best results don't.

c4ylga,"*Recently, I saw a [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/stand-up-for-best-practices-8a8433d3e0e8) by [Rajiv Shah](https://twitter.com/rajcs4), Chicago-based data-scientist, regarding an article published in Nature last year called [Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y), written by scientists at Harvard in collaboration with Google. Below is the article:* **Stand Up for Best Practices: Misuse of Deep Learning in Nature’s Earthquake Aftershock Paper** **The Dangers of Machine Learning Hype** Practitioners of AI, machine learning, predictive modeling, and data science have grown enormously over the last few years. What was once a niche field defined by its blend of knowledge is becoming a rapidly growing profession. As the excitement around AI continues to grow, the new wave of ML augmentation, automation, and GUI tools will lead to even more growth in the number of people trying to build predictive models. But here’s the rub: While it becomes easier to use the tools of predictive modeling, predictive modeling knowledge is not yet a widespread commodity. Errors can be counterintuitive and subtle, and they can easily lead you to the wrong conclusions if you’re not careful. I’m a data scientist who works with dozens of expert data science teams for a living. In my day job, I see these teams striving to build high-quality models. The best teams work together to review their models to detect problems. There are many hard-to-detect-ways that lead to problematic models (say, by allowing target leakage into their training data). Identifying issues is not fun. This requires admitting that exciting results are “too good to be true” or that their methods were not the right approach. In other words, *it’s less about the sexy data science hype that gets headlines and more about a rigorous scientific discipline.* **Bad Methods Create Bad Results** Almost a year ago, I read an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y) in Nature that claimed unprecedented accuracy in predicting earthquake aftershocks by using deep learning. Reading the article, my internal radar became deeply suspicious of their results. *Their methods simply didn’t carry many of the hallmarks of careful predicting modeling.* I started to dig deeper. In the meantime, this article blew up and became [widely recognized](https://blog.google/technology/ai/forecasting-earthquake-aftershock-locations-ai-assisted-science/)! It was even included in the [release notes](https://medium.com/tensorflow/whats-coming-in-tensorflow-2-0-d3663832e9b8) for Tensorflow as an example of what deep learning could do. However, in my digging, I found major flaws in the paper. Namely, data leakage which leads to unrealistic accuracy scores and a lack of attention to model selection (you don’t build a 6 layer neural network when a simpler model provides the same level of accuracy). To my earlier point: these are subtle, but *incredibly basic* predictive modeling errors that can invalidate the entire results of an experiment. Data scientists are trained to recognize and avoid these issues in their work. I assumed that this was simply overlooked by the author, so I contacted her and let her know so that she could improve her analysis. Although we had previously communicated, she did not respond to my email over concerns with the paper. **Falling On Deaf Ears** So, what was I to do? My coworkers told me to just [tweet](https://twitter.com/rajcs4/status/1143236424738775046) [it](https://twitter.com/DataScienceLA/status/1143245342785228800) and let it go, but I wanted to stand up for good modeling practices. I thought reason and best practices would prevail, so I started a 6-month process of writing up my results and shared them with Nature. Upon sharing my results, I received a note from Nature in January 2019 that despite serious concerns about data leakage and model selection that invalidate their experiment, they saw no need to correct the errors, because “**Devries et al. are concerned primarily with using machine learning as [a] tool to extract insight into the natural world, and not with details of the algorithm design**.” The authors provided a much [harsher](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues/blob/master/correspondence/Authors_DeVries_Response.pdf) response. You can read the entire exchange on my [github](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues). It’s not enough to say that I was disappointed. This was a major paper (it’s **Nature**!) that bought into AI hype and published a paper despite it using flawed methods. Then, just this week, I ran [across](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20521-8_1) [articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01983) by Arnaud Mignan and Marco Broccardo on shortcomings that they found in the aftershocks article. Here are two more data scientists with expertise in earthquake analysis who also noticed flaws in the paper. I also have placed my analysis and reproducible code on [github](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues). **Standing Up For Predictive Modeling Methods** I want to make it clear: my goal is not to villainize the authors of the aftershocks paper. I don’t believe that they were malicious, and I think that they would argue their goal was to just show how machine learning could be applied to aftershocks. Devries is an accomplished earthquake scientist who wanted to use the latest methods for her field of study and found exciting results from it. But here’s the problem: their insights and results were based on fundamentally flawed methods. It’s not enough to say, “This isn’t a machine learning paper, it’s an earthquake paper.” If you use predictive modeling, then the quality of your results are determined by the quality of your modeling. Your work becomes data science work, and you are on the hook for your scientific rigor. There is a huge appetite for papers that use the latest technologies and approaches. It becomes very difficult to push back on these papers. But if we allow papers or projects with fundamental issues to advance, it hurts all of us. It undermines the field of predictive modeling. Please push back on bad data science. Report bad findings to papers. And if they don’t take action, go to twitter, post about it, share your results and make noise. This type of collective action worked to raise awareness of p-values and combat the epidemic of p-hacking. We need good machine learning practices if we want our field to continue to grow and maintain credibility.

The comments raised the issue that much simpler methods can achieve pretty much the same results, highlighting the need to do proper ablation studies. The final paragraph of the response basically also said *we are earthquake scientists, who are you?* and told Nature they will be *disappointed* if these comments are published. Why aren't these concerns worthy of publication in Nature? Why should they be censored? Wouldn't publishing them lead to more healthy scientific discussion? They are not unique as there are follow up articles with similar concerns. I dunno, if I was reviewing this paper for an ML conference, I would have similar concerns. At least demand some ablation studies.",179

Some highlights: * AlphaStar can play anonymously as and against the three different races of the game: Protoss, Terran and Zerg in 1vs1 matches, in a non-disclosed future date. Their intention is that players treat AlphaStar as any other player. * Replays will be used to publish a peer-reviewer paper. * They restricted this version of AlphaStar to only interact with the information it gets from the game camera (I assume that this includes the minimap, and not the API from the January version?). * They also increased the restrictions of AlphaStar actions-per-minute (APM), according to pro players advice. There is no additional info in the blog about how this restriction is taking place. Personally, I see this as a very interesting experiment, although I'll like to know more details about the new restrictions that AlphaStar will be using, because as it was discussed here in January, such restrictions can be unfair to human players.

The claim is that [AGI](https://twitter.com/woj_zaremba/status/1105149945118519296) needs to be carefully and collaboratively guided into existence yet the output of almost [every](https://github.com/facebookresearch) [other](https://github.com/google-research/google-research) [existing](https://github.com/salesforce) [commercial](https://github.com/NVlabs) lab is more open. OpenAI runs a closed ecosystem where they primarily don't or won't trust outside of a small bubble. I say this knowing many of the people there and with past and present love in my heart—I don't collaborate with OpenAI as I have no freaking clue what they're doing. Their primary form of communication is high entropy blog posts that'd be shock pivots for any normal start-up. Many of their [blog posts](https://openai.com/blog/cooperation-on-safety/) and [spoken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJi6N4tDupk) [positions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EN_HoEk3KY) end up [influencing government policy](https://twitter.com/jackclarkSF/status/986568940028616705) and public opinion on the future of AI through amplified pseudo-credibility due to *Open*, *Musk founded*, repeatedly hyped statements, and a sheen from their now distant non-profit good will era. I have mentioned this to friends there and say all of this with positive sum intentions: I understand they have lofty aims, I understand they need cash to shovel into the forever unfurling GPU forge, but if they want any community trust long term they need a better strategy. The implicit OpenAI message heard over the years: “Think of how transformative and dangerous AGI may be. Terrifying. Trust us. Whether it's black-boxing technology, legal risk, policy initiatives, investor risk, ...—trust us with everything. We're good. No questions, sorry.” *We'll clarify our position in an upcoming blog post.*","I mean... I don't know what you expected. It's an organization birthed from the same silo as SpaceX and Tesla. You've got a bizarre mix of ultra-hype, tech startup culture, and actual delivery of unusual advances (though never on the timeline that's claimed). None of this seems all that surprising to me at least. I'm not confused about who OpenAI is. That said, in my view, OpenAI has done an enormous amount of good by shifting culture and conversation. Their marketing materials (that's what they are) key in on all kinds of really valuable, lofty ideals and ideas. The fact that OpenAI isn't going to be the one to deliver is almost beside the point... it's easy to take for granted, but was it really a given that ML research right now is done in an open way like this? Where Deep Mind, Facebook, Uber and so on are all publishing regular results instead of silo-ing completely? I do think the coming transition will be possibly the most noteworthy transition in our species, save only maybe for language and agriculture, and I think it could have possibly been (and maybe still will be) that the last chunk of the transition happens behind closed doors. But at least we're talking about Ethics, the control problem, and so on. Considering where OpenAI came from, I'm kind of pleasantly surprised they've had as positive of an impact overall as they have.",204

To the reviewer that said our paper was ""underdeveloped"" because we didn't use a different methodology Y from field Z, we'd like to point out that a) this is in field A, b) we provided a framework for how to extend this to other methodologies in field A, and c) methodology Y has no obvious way to extend to the problem we're addressing (and doing so would be a whole paper in its own right).  Do you often read papers and get frustrated that they aren't the papers you've written? To the same reviewer, who asked why we didn't cite papers Z1 and Z2, we would again point out that this isn't field Z and those papers have no relevance to the topic at hand except that you'd have written a paper on a different topic, which we didn't. To the reviewer that asked why we didn't cite X, we'd like to point out that we did cite X, and had a whole paragraph discussing the relationship of this work to that one. To the reviewer that proposed an example dataset to evaluate our model on, we point out that we already evaluate the model on that data set; see our Experiments section. To the reviewer that pointed out that our method won't work when assumption 3 isn't met, yes, you're correct.  That's why we stated it as an assumption.  Congratulations on your reading comprehension. To the reviewer that directly copy/pasted our introduction into the ""what 3 things does this paper contribute"" box, we'll be sure to include in future revisions a copy/paste-able review justifying ""score 10, confidence 5"" to make your review easier.  That you also confused our main claim with a work we were citing, and otherwise completely missed the discussion on relationship to prior work or what makes this paper novel, makes your review particularly useful to development of the work. To the reviewer that wrote that, while THEY were familiar with the definitions in a reference, we should explain it for readers that might be confused, we understand entirely.  We'll gladly explain it for ""a friend of yours"", err ""readers"", and not you, because you get it and you're smart and it's just the readers who don't. To the reviewer who commented that our results were ""contradictory"" because we said that our modification ""in general performed slightly worse"" on this metric, when in fact our plots show it sometimes performed better, we'll gladly fix our claim to be clear that ""in general"" doesn't mean ""always"" and also our results are even better than the previous wording indicated. To the reviewer that said our comparison method's results were worse than reported in the original paper, we've carefully compared their bar charts to ours and found that the results are the same to the precision of the graphical printout in the previous paper.  If you could lend us your image sharpening function so we can get more significant digits out of their plot, we'd be glad to redo the comparison. To the reviewer who used half of their review to argue that our entire subfield is dumb and wrong, we thank them for reaching across academic lines to provide commentary in an area that pains you deeply. And finally, to the reviewers who called our paper (all actual quotes) ""original, well-motivated, and worthy of study"", ""important in its own right"", that said you ""greatly enjoyed reading this paper"" and that ""this is an interesting problem and certainly worth studying"" and that ""this paper identifies an important problem ...

cok47z,"A victim of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein testified that she was forced to have sex with MIT professor Marvin Minsky, as revealed in a newly unsealed deposition. Epstein was registered as a sex offender in 2008 as part of a controversial plea deal. More recently, he was arrested on charges of sex trafficking amid a flood of new allegations. Minsky, who died in 2016, was known as an associate of Epstein, but this is the first direct accusation implicating the AI pioneer in Epstein’s broader sex trafficking network. The deposition also names Prince Andrew of Britain and former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, among others. The accusation against Minsky was made by Virginia Giuffre, who was deposed in May 2016 as part of a broader defamation suit between her and an Epstein associate named Ghislaine Maxwell. In the deposition, Giuffre says she was directed to have sex with Minsky when he visited Epstein’s compound in the US Virgin Islands. As part of the defamation suit, Maxwell’s counsel denied the allegations, calling them “salacious and improper.” Representatives for Giuffre and Maxwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A separate witness lent credence to Giuffre’s account, testifying that she and Minsky had taken a private plane from Teterboro to Santa Fe and Palm Beach in March 2001. Epstein, Maxwell, chef Adam Perry Lang, and shipping heir Henry Jarecki were also passengers on the flight, according to the deposition. At the time of the flight, Giuffre was 17; Minsky was 73.

A pivotal member of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, Marvin Minsky pioneered the first generation of self-training algorithms, establishing the concept of artificial neural networks in his 1969 book Perceptrons. He also developed the first head-mounted display, a precursor to modern VR and augmented reality systems. Minsky was one of a number of prominent scientists with ties to Jeffrey Epstein, who often called himself a “science philanthropist” and donated to research projects and academic institutions. Many of those scientists were affiliated with Harvard, including physicist Lawrence Krauss, geneticist George Church, and cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker. Minsky’s affiliation with Epstein went particularly deep, including organizing a two-day symposium on artificial intelligence at Epstein’s private island in 2002, as reported by Slate. In 2012, the Jeffrey Epstein Foundation issued a press release touting another conference organized by Minsky on the island in December 2011. That private island is alleged to have been the site of an immense sex trafficking ring. But Epstein associates have argued that those crimes were not apparent to Epstein’s social relations, despite the presence of young women at many of his gatherings. “These people were seen not only by me,” Alan Dershowitz argued in a 2015 deposition. “They were seen by Larry Summers, they were seen by \[George\] Church, they were seen by Marvin Minsky, they were seen by some of the most eminent academics and scholars in the world.” “There was no hint or suggestion of anything sexual or improper in the presence of these people,” Dershowitz continued. &#x200B; [https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed)",“Accused of having sex with a trafficking victim” - the language is so wrong here.

Here is a link to a WayBackMachine captures of u/klarken's documentation of Siraj's potential misdeeds: [case for a refund](https://web.archive.org/save/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/feedback.html), [discussion in course Discord](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211614/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reference_messages.png), [\~1200 individuals in the course](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211815/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/members.png), [Multiple Slack channel discussion, students hidden from each other](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211940/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/multiple_slack_channels.png), [""Hundreds refunded""](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923212113/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hundreds_refunded.png) According to Twitter threads, he has been banning anyone in his Discord/Slack that has been asking for refunds. On top of this there are many Twitter threads regarding his behavior. A screenshot (bottom of post) of an account that has since been deactivated/deleted (he made the account to try and get Siraj's attention). Here is a Twitter WayBackMachine archive link of a search for the user in the screenshot: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190921130513/https:/twitter.com/search?q=safayet96434935&src=typed\_query](https://web.archive.org/web/20190921130513/https:/twitter.com/search?q=safayet96434935&src=typed_query).

d9jidd,"HuggingFace has just released Transformers 2.0, a library for Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch which provides state-of-the-art pretrained models in most recent NLP architectures (BERT, GPT-2, XLNet, RoBERTa, DistilBert, XLM...) comprising several multi-lingual models. An interesting feature is that the library provides deep interoperability between TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch. You can move a full model seamlessly from one framework to the other during its lifetime (instead of just exporting a static computation graph at the end like with ONNX). This way it's possible to get the best of both worlds by selecting the best framework for each step of training, evaluation, production, e.g. train on TPUs before finetuning/testing in PyTorch and finally deploy with TF-X. An [example in the readme](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers#quick-tour-tf-20-training-and-pytorch-interoperability) shows how Bert can be finetuned on GLUE in a few lines of code with the high-level API `tf.keras.Model.fit()` and then loaded in PyTorch for quick and easy inspection and debugging. As TensorFlow and PyTorch as getting closer, this kind of deep interoperability between both frameworks could become a new norm for multi-backends libraries.

The workshop is cancelled, and that’s all,” Guillaume Belanger, an astrophysicist and the INTEGRAL Science Operations Coordinator at the ESA, told The Register on Monday. Raval isn’t about to quit his work any time soon, however. He promised students who graduated from his course that they would be referred to recruiters at Nvidia, Intel, Google and Amazon for engineering positions, or matched with a startup co-founder or a consulting client. In an unlisted YouTube video recorded live for his students discussing week eight of his course, and seen by El Reg, he read out a question posed to him: “Will your referrals hold any value now?” “Um, yeah they’re going to hold value. I don’t see why they wouldn’t. I mean, yes, some people on Twitter were angry but that has nothing to do with… I mean… I’ve also had tons of support, you know. I’ve had tons of support from people, who, uh, you know, support me, who work at these companies. *He continues to justify his actions:* “Public figures called me in private to remind me that this happens. You know, people make mistakes. You just have to keep going. They’re basically just telling me to not to stop. Of course, you make mistakes but you just keep going,” he claimed. *When The Register asked Raval for comment, he responded:* **I've hardly taken any time off to relax since I first started my YouTube channel almost four years ago. And despite the enormous amount of work it takes to release two high quality videos a week for my audience, I progressively started to take on multiple other projects simultaneously by myself – a book, a docu-series, podcasts, YouTube videos, the course, the school of AI. Basically, these past few weeks, I've been experiencing a burnout unlike anything I've felt before. As a result, all of my output has been subpar.** **I made the [neural qubits] video and paper in one week. I remember wishing I had three to six months to really dive into quantum machine-learning and make something awesome, but telling myself I couldn't take that long as it would hinder my other projects. I plagiarized large chunks of the paper to meet my self-imposed one-week deadline. The associated video with animations took a lot more work to make. I didn't expect the paper to be cited as serious research, I considered it an additional reading resource for people who enjoyed the associated video to learn more about quantum machine learning. If I had a second chance, I'd definitely take way more time to write the paper, and in my own words.** **I've given refunds to every student who's asked so far, and the majority of students are still enrolled in the course.

Overall, our  contribution substantially advances the current methodology for  detecting CHF and caters to clinical practitioners’ needs by providing  an accurate and fully transparent tool to support decisions concerning  CHF detection.

djju8a,"he did not call it GAN, he called it curiosity, it's actually famous work, many citations in all the papers on intrinsic motivation and exploration, although I bet many GAN people don't know this yet I learned about it through his [inaugural tweet](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI) on their [miraculous year](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html). I knew LSTM, but I did not know that he and Sepp Hochreiter did all those other things 30 years ago.  The blog sums it up in section 5 Artificial Curiosity Through Adversarial Generative Neural Networks (1990) > The first NN is called the controller C. C (probabilistically) generates outputs that may influence an environment. The second NN is called the world model M. It predicts the environmental reactions to C's outputs. Using gradient descent, M minimises its error, thus becoming a better predictor. But in a zero sum game, C tries to find outputs that maximise the error of M. M's loss is the gain of C.   > That is, C is motivated to invent novel outputs or experiments that yield data that M still finds surprising, until the data becomes familiar and eventually boring. Compare more recent summaries and extensions of this principle, e.g., [AC09].  > GANs are an application of Adversarial Curiosity [AC90] where the environment simply returns whether C's current output is in a given set [AC19]. So I read those referenced papers. [AC19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04493) is kinda modern guide to the old report [AC90](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-126-90ocr.pdf) where the adversarial part first appeared in section: Implementing Dynamic Curiosity and Boredom, and the generative part in section: Explicit Random Actions versus Imported Randomness, which is like GANs versus conditional GANs. [AC09](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/multipleways2009.pdf) is a survey from 2009 and sums it up: maximise reward for prediction error. I know that Ian Goodfellow says he is the inventor of GANs, but he must have been a little boy when Jurgen did this in 1990. Also funny that Yann LeCun described GANs as ""the coolest idea in machine learning in the last twenty years"" although Jurgen had it thirty years ago   No, it is NOT the same as predictability minimisation, that's yet another adversarial game he invented, in 1991, section 7 of his [explosive blog post which contains additional jaw-droppers](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html)",Should've received the Turing award as well.

In fact, that’s one of the reasons why people often use “keyword-ese,” typing strings of words that they think we’ll understand, but aren’t actually how they’d naturally ask a question.  With the latest advancements from our research team in the science of language understanding--made possible by machine learning--we’re making a significant improvement to how we understand queries, representing the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of Search.  **Applying BERT models to Search**   Last year, we [introduced and open-sourced](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) a neural network-based technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or as we call it--[BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html), for short. This technology enables anyone to train their own state-of-the-art question answering system.  This breakthrough was the result of Google research on [transformers](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html): models that process words in relation to all the other words in a sentence, rather than one-by-one in order. BERT models can therefore consider the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it—particularly useful for understanding the intent behind search queries. But it’s not just advancements in software that can make this possible: we needed new hardware too. Some of the models we can build with BERT are so complex that they push the limits of what we can do using traditional hardware, so for the first time we’re using the latest [Cloud TPUs ](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-pods-break-ai-training-records)to serve search results and get you more relevant information quickly.  **Cracking your queries**   So that’s a lot of technical details, but what does it all mean for you? Well, by applying BERT models to both ranking and featured snippets in Search, we’re able to do a much better job  helping you find useful information. In fact, when it comes to ranking results, BERT will help Search better understand one in 10 searches in the U.S. in English, and we’ll bring this to more languages and locales over time. Particularly for longer, more conversational queries, or searches where prepositions like “for” and “to” matter a lot to the meaning, Search will be able to understand the context of the words in your query. You can search in a way that feels natural for you. To launch these improvements, we did a lot of [testing](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/users/) to ensure that the changes actually are more helpful. Here are some of the examples that showed up our evaluation process that demonstrate BERT’s ability to understand the intent behind your search.    Here’s a search for “2019 brazil traveler to usa need a visa.” The word “to” and its relationship to the other words in the query are particularly important to understanding the meaning. It’s about a Brazilian traveling to the U.S., and not the other way around. Previously, our algorithms wouldn't understand the importance of this connection, and we returned results about U.S. citizens traveling to Brazil. With BERT, Search is able to grasp this nuance and know that the very common word “to” actually matters a lot here, and we can provide a much more relevant result for this query. Let’s look at another query: “do estheticians stand a lot at work.” Previously, our systems were taking an approach of matching keywords, matching the term “stand-alone” in the result with the word “stand” in the query. But that isn’t the right use of the word “stand” in context. Our BERT models, on the other hand, understand that “stand” is related to the concept of the physical demands of a job, and displays a more useful response. Here are some other examples where BERT has helped us grasp the subtle nuances of language that computers don’t quite understand the way humans do. **Improving Search in more languages**   We’re also applying BERT to make Search better for people across the world. A powerful characteristic of these systems is that they can take learnings from one language and apply them to others. So we can take models that learn from improvements in English (a language where the vast majority of web content exists) and apply them to other languages. This helps us better return relevant results in the many languages that Search is offered in. For featured snippets, we’re using a BERT model to improve featured snippets in the two dozen countries where this feature is available, and seeing significant improvements in languages like Korean, Hindi and Portuguese. **Search is not a solved problem**   No matter what you’re looking for, or what language you speak, we hope you’re able to let go of some of your keyword-ese and search in a way that feels natural for you. But you’ll still stump Google from time to time. Even with BERT, we don’t always get it right. If you search for “what state is south of Nebraska,” BERT’s best guess is a community called “South Nebraska.” (If you've got a feeling it's not in Kansas, you're right.) Language understanding remains an ongoing challenge, and it keeps us motivated to continue to improve Search. We’re always getting better and working to find the meaning in-- and most helpful information for-- every query you send our way.

dp389c,"Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone else have similar feelings with regards to a number of accepted papers coming from Chinese universities/authors presented in ICCV. Thus far in the conference, I came across quite a lot of papers with questionable motives which made me question the ethical consequences. These papers are, for the most part, concerned with various forms of person identification (i.e., typical big brother stuff). In fact, when you look at the accepted papers, more than 80% of any kind of identification papers have Chinese authors/affiliations. But that's not all, some papers go to extreme lengths of person re-identification such as: 1- Occluded person re- identification (i.e., person re-identification through mask/glass) 2- Person re-identification in low-light environments 3- Cross domain person re-identification 4- Cross dataset person re-identification 5- Cross modality person re-identification 6- Unsupervised person re-identification &#x200B; And maybe you think person re-identification is all there is, but its not. There are also: 1- Vehicle identification, vehicle re-identification, vehicle re-identification from aerial images 2- Occluded vehicle recovery 3- Lip reading from video sequences 4- Crowd counting in scenes, crowd density prediction, and crowd counting in aerial pictures (in fact, all but one crowd counting papers are China affiliated) &#x200B; I wonder whether I am being overly sensitive due to recent influx of news about Uighurs in China and Hong Kong protests etc. or if these papers are basically funded by the Chinese government (or its extensions) for some big brother stuff. What is your opinion on the research on these subjects which can be used for some ethically questionable applications getting published in top conferences? &#x200B; Edit: I should mention that I did not mean to offend any Chinese researchers and I am of course aware that many great inventions in recent ML/DL research that we use came from Chinese researchers. What I stated above is merely my observation while passing by the posters in the conference. Edit2: If you want to check it out yourself, you can visit [http://openaccess.thecvf.com/ICCV2019.py](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/ICCV2019.py) and search the term 'identification'.","To add fuel to your fire, any researchers I know working on vision for identification are funded by Chinese companies but they themselves, and their research group, are not Chinese.

dq82x7,"I recently read the paper ""Adversarial Training for Review-Based Recommendations"" published on the SIGIR 2019 conference. I noticed that this paper is almost exactly the same as the paper ""Why I like it: Multi-task Learning for Recommendation and Explanation"" published on the RecSys 2018 conference. At first, I thought it is just a coincidence. It is likely for researchers to have similar ideas. Therefore it is possible that two research groups independently working on the same problem come up with the same solution. However, after thoroughly reading and comparing the two papers, now I believe that the SIGIR 2019 paper is plagiarizing the RecSys 2018 paper. The model proposed in the SIGIR 2019 paper is almost a replicate of the model in the RecSys 2018 paper. (1) Both papers used an adversarial sequence-to-sequence learning model on top of the matrix factorization framework. (2) For the generator and discriminator part, both papers use GRU for generator and CNN for discriminator. (3) The optimization methodology is the same, i.e. alternating optimization between two parts. (4) The evaluations are the same, i.e. evaluating MSE for recommendation performance and evaluating the accuracy for discriminator to show that the generator has learned to generate relevant reviews. (5) The notations and also the formulas that have been used by the two papers look extremely similar. While ideas can be similar given that adversarial training has been prevalent in the literature for a while, it is suspicious for the SIGIR 2019 paper to have large amount of text overlaps with the RecSys 2018 paper. Consider the following two sentences: (1) ""The Deep Cooperative Neural Network (DeepCoNN) model user-item interactions based on review texts by utilizing a factorization machine model on top of two convolutional neural networks."" in Section 1 of the SIGIR 2019 paper. (2) ""Deep Cooperative Neural Network (DeepCoNN) model user-item interactions based on review texts by utilizing a factorization machine model on top of two convolutional neural networks."" in Section 2 of the RecSys 2018 paper. I think this is the most obvious sign of plagiarism. If you search Google for this sentence using ""exact match"", you will find that this sentence is only used by these two papers. It is hard to believe that the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper could come up with the exact same sentence without reading the RecSys 2018 paper. As another example: (1) ""The decoder employs a single GRU that iteratively produces reviews word by word. In particular, at time step $t$ the GRU first maps the output representation $z\_{ut-1}$ of the previous time step into a $k$-dimensional vector $y\_{ut-1}$ and concatenates it with $\\bar{U\_{u}}$ to generate a new vector $y\_{ut}$. Finally, $y\_{ut}$ is fed to the GRU to obtain the hidden representation $h\_{t}$, and then $h\_{t}$ is multiplied by an output projection matrix and passed through a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary of the document to represent the probability of each word. The output word $z\_{ut}$ at time step $t$ is sampled from the multinomial distribution given by the softmax."" in Section 2.1 of the SIGIR 2019 paper. (2) ""The user review decoder utilizes a single decoder GRU that iteratively generates reviews word by word. At time step $t$, the decoder GRU first embeds the output word $y\_{i, t-1}$ at the previous time step into the corresponding word vector $x\_{i, t-1} \\in \\mathcal{R}\^{k}$, and then concatenate it with the user textual feature vector $\\widetilde{U\_{i}}$. The concatenated vector is provided as input into the decoder GRU to obtain the hidden activation $h\_{t}$. Then the hidden activation is multiplied by an output projection matrix and passed through a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary to represent the probability of each word given the current context. The output word $y\_{i, t}$ at time step $t$ is sampled from the multinomial distribution given by the softmax."" in Section 3.1.1 of the RecSys 2018 paper. In this example, the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper has replaced some of the phrases in the writing so that the two texts are not exactly the same. However, I believe the similarity of the two texts still shows that the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper must have read the RecSys 2018 paper before writing their own paper. I do not intend to go through all the text overlaps between the two papers, but let us see a final example: (1) ""Each word of the review $r$ is mapped to the corresponding word vector, which is then concatenated with a user-specific vector. Notice that the user-specific vectors are learned together with the parameters of the discriminator $D\_{\\theta}$ in the adversarial training of Section 2.3. The concatenated vector representations are then processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected projection layer. The final output of the CNN is a sigmoid function which normalizes the probability into the interval of $\[0, 1\]$"", expressing the probability that the candidate review $r$ is written by user $u$."" in Section 2.2 of the SIGIR 2019 paper. (2) ""To begin with, each word in the review is mapped to the corresponding word vector, which is then concatenated with a user-specific vector that identifies user information. The user-specific vectors are learned together with other parameters during training. The concatenated vector representations are then processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected layer. The final output unit is a sigmoid non-linearity, which squashes the probability into the $\[0, 1\]$ interval."" in Section 3.1.2 of the RecSys 2018 paper. There is one sentence (""The concatenated vector representations are ...... a fully-connected projection layer."") that is exactly the same in the two papers. Also, I think concatenating the user-specific vectors to every word vector in the review is a very unintuitive idea. I do not think ideas from different research groups can be the same in that granularity of detail. If I were the authors, I will just concatenate the user-specific vectors to the layer before the final projection layer, as it saves computational cost and should lead to better generalization. As a newbie in information retrieval, I am not sure if such case should be considered as plagiarism. However, as my professor told me that the SIGIR conference is the premier conference in the IR community, I believe that this paper definitely should not be published at a top conference such as SIGIR. What makes me feel worse is that the two authors of this paper, Dimitrios Rafailidis from Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands and Fabio Crestani from Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), Lugano, Switzerland, are both professors. They should be aware that plagiarism is a big deal in academia.

dr2vir,"David Silver hinted that DeepMind is done with Starcraft in a BBC news article saying ""the lab may rest now"" and that they have ""completed the Starcraft challenge"". I thought this was a little disappointing since the skill level Alphastar reached on ladder was not enough to beat professional players. I think we all wanted a real nice showdown between the human champion and the robot, right? That'd been pretty cool. [The Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z.epdf?author_access_token=lZH3nqPYtWJXfDA10W0CNNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PSZcPzJFGNAZhOlk4deBCKzKm70KfinloafEF1bCCXL6IIHHgKaDkaTkBcTEv7aT-wqDoG1VeO9-wO3GEoAMF9bAOt7mJ0RWQnRVMbyfgH9A%3D%3D) had a nice graph depicting Alphastar's MMR which is basically Blizzard's version of elo rating. The Protoss agent had reached an MMR of 6275 and the aggregate of all three races was 6048. The graph also had MMR's of Alphastar's opponents and information on whether the agent won or lost. https://preview.redd.it/zn8ygrv6zjw31.jpg?width=1215&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50e22ec6fa34900c9a14eddabf48304f7de9c9d3 Greens are wins and reds are losses. Basically Alphastar had lost all but 2 games against players who had higher than 6200 MMR. On ladder, it could not beat the professionals. The agent from January was estimated by DeepMind to have been over 7000 MMR. I figured it'd be nice to estimate how well this newest agent would have fared against Mana. Right now, MaNa's MMR is \~6700. So I looked at the EU ladder, found someone with an MMR of \~6200, popped him and MaNa into Aligulac (sc2 database) and let it estimate some odds. MaNa had \~75% chance of winning a Best of 5, and his 6200 MMR opponent had less than 1% chance of beating MaNa 5-0. At this point I became convinced that DeepMind was throwing in the towel on sc2 because the cost of further improving Alphastar was too high to justify the publicity they were getting from the project. The team looked to be moving on to different things and the showmatch vs the world champion had been cancelled. But then something absolutely baffling happened which I don't think anyone saw coming. Blizzcon was this weekend. With little to no fanfare DeepMind had brought Alphastar with them and let Blizzcon visitors play against it. Serral, one of the best players in the world, had just finished top 4 in the biggest tournament of the year wandered to the arcade and played a few games against the bot. Serral's MMR is over 7000. [He lost 0-3 to the Protoss agent.](https://mobile.twitter.com/LiquidTLO/status/1190779241564000256) These games were not televised. All we have is some blurry smartphone footage. I don't get it. If Alphastar was this strong why didn't DeepMind let it play more on ladder and get a higher ranking? Why didn't they organize a showmatch or something? They dropped the ball pretty hard on this one. This is so confusing to me. First they beat two professional players but were hit with a huge, imo warranted backlash due to the APM controversy. Then they produced agents under more proper mechanical limitations and the agents turned out to be far weaker than the previous version. Finally, they beat the best player in the world, seemingly accidentally while no one was watching. From PR standpoint, could this have gone any worse for DeepMind?","I am a grandmaster StarCraft player and I can say this is not representative at all. If I play with just a different mouse, I will play at 500 Match Making Rating lower (the amount of skill I've gained in a year of almost daily practice, and MMR gain feels logarithmic with respect to time put in) for about a week until I get used to the new controls. That is when I can fully control the mouse speed (Serral couldn't)--just the weight of the mouse being different makes me play worse. It completely throws off your rhythm, so even your actions per minute will be substantially lower. A different keyboard will throw me off too. Even playing on high ping (100ms) reduces by actions per minute by about 50 just because it throws off my mental rhythm. And even worse, Serral couldn't rebind hotkeys. When playing zerg an essential part the game requires you to almost instantaneously cycle through viewing all your bases to perform an action on each base every ~20 seconds. This is only possible quickly with camera hotkeys, which are bound weirdly by default so I doubt Serral could even use them. All the hotkeys were different too, which would be extremely annoying.  It sounds silly but the chair is a big deal too. StarCraft is such a psychological game that even little things can throw you off. A bad day means I play at the same level as someone 300 MMR lower usually. In a real showmatch, AlphaStar would get smashed by Serral, who is probably not even the best player in the world this year. I think DeepMind knows that they can't do any better without spending a huge amount of resources, so they aren't even bothering.",237

The leak features classified intelligence briefings that reveal, in the government’s own words, how Xinjiang police essentially take orders from a massive “cybernetic brain” known as IJOP, which flags entire categories of people for investigation & detention. These secret intelligence briefings reveal the scope and ambition of the government’s AI-powered policing platform, which purports to predict crimes based on computer-generated findings alone. The result? Arrest by algorithm. **The article describe methods used for algorithmic policing** The classified intelligence briefings reveal the scope and ambition of the government’s artificial-intelligence-powered policing platform, which purports to predict crimes based on these computer-generated findings alone. Experts say the platform, which is used in both policing and military contexts, demonstrates the power of technology to help drive industrial-scale human rights abuses. “The Chinese [government] have bought into a model of policing where they believe that through the collection of large-scale data run through artificial intelligence and machine learning that they can, in fact, predict ahead of time where possible incidents might take place, as well as identify possible populations that have the propensity to engage in anti-state anti-regime action,” said Mulvenon, the SOS International document expert and director of intelligence integration. “And then they are preemptively going after those people using that data.” In addition to the predictive policing aspect of the article, there are side [articles](https://qz.com/1755018/chinas-manual-for-uighur-detention-camps-revealed-in-data-leak/) about the entire ML stack, including how [mobile apps](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/how-china-targets-uighurs-one-by-one-for-using-a-mobile-app/) are used to target Uighurs, and also how the inmates are [re-educated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50511063) once inside the concentration camps. The documents reveal how every aspect of a detainee's life is monitored and controlled. *Note: My motivation for posting this story is to raise ethical concerns and awareness in the research community. I do not want to heighten levels of racism towards the Chinese research community (not that it may matter, but I am Chinese). See this [thread](https://redd.it/e10b5x) for some context about what I don't want these discussions to become.* *I am aware of the fact that the Chinese government's policy is to integrate the state and the people as one, so accusing the party is perceived domestically as insulting the Chinese people, but I also believe that we as a research community is intelligent enough to be able to separate government, and those in power, from individual researchers. We as a community should keep in mind that there are many Chinese researchers (in mainland and abroad) who are not supportive of the actions of the CCP, but they may not be able to voice their concerns due to personal risk.* **Edit** Suggestion from /u/DunkelBeard: When discussing issues relating to the Chinese government, try to use the term CCP, Chinese Communist Party, Chinese government, or Beijing. Try *not* to use only the term *Chinese* or *China* when describing the government, as it may be misinterpreted as referring to the Chinese people (either citizens of China, or people of Chinese ethnicity), if that is not your intention.

ecchg8,"A few weeks ago, the .comdom app was released by Telenet, a large Belgian telecom provider. The app aims to make sexting safer, by overlaying a private picture with a visible watermark that contains the receiver's name and phone number. As such, a receiver is discouraged to leak nude pictures. [Example of watermarked image](https://preview.redd.it/q4fremfttd541.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31e8619cf977d0c595e5a5d43ff71f0eacaec634) The .comdom app claims to provide a safer alternative than apps such as Snapchat and Confide, which have functions such as screenshot-proofing and self-destructing messages or images. These functions only provide the illusion of security. For example, it's simple to capture the screen of your smartphone using another camera, and thus cirumventing the screenshot-proofing and self-destruction of the private images. However, we found that the .comdom app only *increases* the illusion of security. In a matter of days, we (IDLab-MEDIA from Ghent University) were able to automatically remove these visible watermarks from images. We watermarked thousands of random pictures in the same way that the .comdom app does, and provided those to a simple convolutional neural network with these images. As such, the AI algorithm learns to perform some form of image inpainting. [Unwatermarked image, using our machine learning algorithm](https://preview.redd.it/ykkf8d5pyd541.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46158274a580dcb38861c5538b6b007fbd250595) Thus, the developers of the .comdom have underestimated the power of modern AI technologies.

eg8mmn,"- Long short-term memory. S Hochreiter, J Schmidhuber. Neural computation, MIT Press, 1997 (26k citations as of 2019) It has passed the backpropagation papers by Rumelhart et al. (1985, 1986, 1987). Don't get confused by Google Scholar which sometimes incorrectly lumps together different Rumelhart publications including:  - Learning internal representations by error propagation. DE Rumelhart, GE Hinton, RJ Williams, California Univ San Diego La Jolla, Inst for Cognitive Science, 1985 (25k) - Parallel distributed processing. JL McClelland, DE Rumelhart, PDP Research Group, MIT press, 1987 (24k) - Learning representations by back-propagating errors. DE Rumelhart, GE Hinton, RJ Williams, Nature 323 (6088), 533-536, 1986 (19k)  I think it's good that the backpropagation paper is no longer number one, because it's a bad role model. It does not cite the true inventors of backpropagation, and the authors have never corrected this. I learned this on reddit: [Schmidhuber on Linnainmaa, inventor of backpropagation in 1970](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/e5vzun/d_jurgen_schmidhuber_on_seppo_linnainmaa_inventor/). This post also mentions Kelley (1960) and Werbos (1982).  The LSTM paper is now receiving more citations per year than all of Rumelhart's backpropagation papers combined. And  more than the most cited paper by LeCun and Bengio (1998) which is about CNNs:  - Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Y LeCun, L Bottou, Y Bengio, P Haffner, IEEE 86 (11), 2278-2324, 1998 (23k)   It may soon have more citations than Bishop's textbook on neural networks (1995).   In the 21st century, activity in the field has surged, and I found three deep learning research papers with even more citations. All of them are about applications of neural networks to ImageNet (2012, 2014, 2015). One paper describes a fast, CUDA-based, deep CNN (AlexNet) that won ImageNet 2012. Another paper describes a significantly deeper CUDA CNN that won ImageNet 2014:   - A Krizhevsky, I Sutskever, GE Hinton. Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. NeuerIPS 2012 (53k)  - B. K Simonyan, A Zisserman. Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition. arXiv:1409.1556, 2014 (32k) The paper with the most citations per year is a recent one on the much deeper ResNet which won ImageNet 2015:  - K He, X Zhang, S Ren, J Sun. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. CVPR 2016 (36k; 18k in 2019) Remarkably, such ""contest-winning deep GPU-based CNNs"" can also be traced back to the Schmidhuber lab. Krizhevsky cites DanNet, the first CUDA CNN to win image recognition challenges and the first superhuman CNN (2011). I learned this on reddit: [DanNet, the CUDA CNN of Dan Ciresan in Jürgen Schmidhuber's team, won 4 image recognition challenges prior to AlexNet](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/dwnuwh/d_dannet_the_cuda_cnn_of_dan_ciresan_in_jurgen/): ICDAR 2011 Chinese handwriting contest - IJCNN 2011 traffic sign recognition contest - ISBI 2012 image segmentation contest - ICPR 2012 medical imaging contest.   ResNet is much deeper than DanNet and AlexNet and works even better. It cites the [Highway Net](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/highway-networks.html) (Srivastava & Greff & Schmidhuber, 2015) of which it is a special case. In a sense, this closes the LSTM circle, because ""Highway Nets are essentially feedforward versions of recurrent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks."" Most LSTM citations refer to the 1997 LSTM paper. However, Schmidhuber's [post on their Annus Mirabilis](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204) points out that ""essential insights"" for LSTM date back to Seep Hochreiter's 1991 diploma thesis which he considers ""one of the most important documents in the history of machine learning."" (He also credits other students: ""LSTM and its training procedures were further improved"" ""through the work of my later students Felix Gers, Alex Graves, and others."") The LSTM principle is essential for both recurrent networks and feedforward networks. Today it is on every smartphone. And in Deepmind's Starcraft champion and OpenAI's Dota champion. And in thousands of additional applications. It is the core of the deep learning revolution.",The LSTM paper also blessed us with [the most beautiful figure to grace the annals of machine learning.](https://imgur.com/a/84PMzyp),172

What is missing from the description above is that this is the first example of how human neurons are qualitatively different than rodent neurons (not only more computation power, but categorically different computation). **ELI5**: the way the biological human neuron implements XOR is by a formerly unknown type of local response to inputs, which is low below the threshold, maximal at the threshold and decreases as the input intensifies above the threshold. We never saw anything like that in any other animal. ([link to the relevant figure from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/gcJFiIZ.jpg))",194

ep8m3q,"Facebook AI has built the first AI system that can solve advanced mathematics equations using symbolic reasoning. By developing a new way to represent complex mathematical expressions as a kind of language and then treating solutions as a translation problem for sequence-to-sequence neural networks, we built a system that outperforms traditional computation systems at solving integration problems and both first- and second-order differential equations. Previously, these kinds of problems were considered out of the reach of deep learning models, because solving complex equations requires precision rather than approximation. Neural networks excel at learning to succeed through approximation, such as recognizing that a particular pattern of pixels is likely to be an image of a dog or that features of a sentence in one language match those in another. Solving complex equations also requires the ability to work with symbolic data, such as the letters in the formula b - 4ac = 7. Such variables can’t be directly added, multiplied, or divided, and using only traditional pattern matching or statistical analysis, neural networks were limited to extremely simple mathematical problems. Our solution was an entirely new approach that treats complex equations like sentences in a language. This allowed us to leverage proven techniques in neural machine translation (NMT), training models to essentially translate problems into solutions. Implementing this approach required developing a method for breaking existing mathematical expressions into a language-like syntax, as well as generating a large-scale training data set of more than 100M paired equations and solutions. When presented with thousands of unseen expressions — equations that weren’t part of its training data — our model performed with significantly more speed and accuracy than traditional, algebra-based equation-solving software, such as Maple, Mathematica, and Matlab. This work not only demonstrates that deep learning can be used for symbolic reasoning but also suggests that neural networks have the potential to tackle a wider variety of tasks, including those not typically associated with pattern recognition. We’re sharing details about our approach as well as methods to help others generate similar training sets. A new way to apply NMT Humans who are particularly good at symbolic math often rely on a kind of intuition. They have a sense of what the solution to a given problem should look like — such as observing that if there is a cosine in the function we want to integrate, then there may be a sine in its integral — and then do the necessary work to prove it. This is different from the direct calculation required for algebra. By training a model to detect patterns in symbolic equations, we believed that a neural network could piece together the clues that led to their solutions, roughly similar to a human’s intuition-based approach to complex problems. So we began exploring symbolic reasoning as an NMT problem, in which a model could predict possible solutions based on examples of problems and their matching solutions. An example of how our approach expands an existing equation (on the left) into an expression tree that can serve as input for a translation model. For this equation, the preorder sequence input into our model would be: (plus, times, 3, power, x, 2, minus, cosine, times, 2, x, 1). To implement this application with neural networks, we needed a novel way of representing mathematical expressions. NMT systems are typically sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, using sequences of words as input, and outputting new sequences, allowing them to translate complete sentences rather than individual words. We used a two-step approach to apply this method to symbolic equations. First, we developed a process that effectively unpacks equations, laying them out in a branching, treelike structure that can then be expanded into sequences that are compatible with seq2seq models. Constants and variables act as leaves, while operators (such as plus and minus) and functions are the internal nodes that connect the branches of the tree. &#x200B; Though it might not look like a traditional language, organizing expressions in this way provides a language-like syntax for equations — numbers and variables are nouns, while operators act as verbs. Our approach enables an NMT model to learn to align the patterns of a given tree-structured problem with its matching solution (also expressed as a tree), similar to matching a sentence in one language with its confirmed translation. This method lets us leverage powerful, out-of-the-box seq2seq NMT models, swapping out sequences of words for sequences of symbols. &#x200B; Building a new data set for training Though our expression-tree syntax made it theoretically possible for an NMT model to effectively translate complex math problems into solutions, training such a model would require a large set of examples. And because in the two classes of problems we focused on — integration and differential equations — a randomly generated problem does not always have a solution, we couldn’t simply collect equations and feed them into the system. We needed to generate an entirely novel training set consisting of examples of solved equations restructured as model-readable expression trees. This resulted in problem-solution pairs, similar to a corpus of sentences translated between languages. Our set would also have to be significantly larger than the training data used in previous research in this area, which has attempted to train systems on thousands of examples. Since neural networks generally perform better when they have more training data, we created a set with millions of examples. &#x200B; Building this data set required us to incorporate a range of data cleaning and generation techniques. For our symbolic integration equations, for example, we flipped the translation approach around: Instead of generating problems and finding their solutions, we generated solutions and found their problem (their derivative), which is a much easier task. This approach of generating problems from their solutions — what engineers sometimes refer to as trapdoor problems — made it feasible to create millions of integration examples. Our resulting translation-inspired data set consists of roughly 100M paired examples, with subsets of integration problems as well as first- and second-order differential equations. &#x200B; We used this data set to train a seq2seq transformer model with eight attention heads and six layers. Transformers are commonly used for translation tasks, and our network was built to predict the solutions for different kinds of equations, such as determining a primitive for a given function. To gauge our model’s performance, we presented it with 5,000 unseen expressions, forcing the system to recognize patterns within equations that didn’t appear in its training. Our model demonstrated 99.7 percent accuracy when solving integration problems, and 94 percent and 81.2 percent accuracy, respectively, for first- and second-order differential equations. Those results exceeded those of all three of the traditional equation solvers we tested against. Mathematica achieved the next best results, with 84 percent accuracy on the same integration problems and 77.2 percent and 61.6 percent for differential equation results. Our model also returned most predictions in less than 0.5 second, while the other systems took several minutes to find a solution and sometimes timed out entirely. Our model took the equations on the left as input — equations that both Mathematica and Matlab were unable to solve — and was able to find correct solutions (shown on the right) in less than one second. Comparing generated solutions to reference solutions allowed us to easily and precisely validate the results. But our model is also able to produce multiple solutions for a given equation. This is similar to what happens in machine translation, where there are many ways to translate an input sentence. What’s next for equation-solving AI Our model currently works on problems with a single variable, and we plan to expand it to multiple-variable equations. This approach could also be applied to other mathematics- and logic-based fields, such as physics, potentially leading to software that assists scientists in a broad range of work. But our system has broader implications for the study and use of neural networks. By discovering a way to use deep learning where it was previously seen as unfeasible, this work suggests that other tasks could benefit from AI. Whether through the further application of NLP techniques to domains that haven’t traditionally been associated with languages, or through even more open-ended explorations of pattern recognition in new or seemingly unrelated tasks, the perceived limitations of neural networks may be limitations of imagination, not technology.

erx7d2,"While preterm birth is still the leading cause of death among young children, we noticed a large number (24!) of studies reporting near-perfect results on a public dataset when estimating the risk of preterm birth for a patient.

After discovering this, we were able to reproduce their results, but only when making a fundamental methodological flaw: applying over-sampling before partitioning data into training and testing set. In this work, we highlight why applying over-sampling before data partitioning results in overly optimistic results and reproduce the results of all studies we suspected of making that mistake.

eyg2hv,"TL;DR for those who dont want to read the full rant.  Spent hours performing feature selection,data preprocessing, pipeline building, choosing a model that gives decent results on all metrics and extensive testing only to lose to someone who used a model that was clearly overfitting on a dataset that was clearly broken, all because the other team was using ""deep learning"". Are buzzwords all that matter to execs?  I've been learning Machine Learning for the past 2 years now. Most of my experience has been with Deep Learning.  Recently, I participated in a Hackathon. The Problem statement my team picked was ""Anomaly detection in Network Traffic using Machine Learning/Deep Learning"". Us being mostly a DL shop, thats the first approach we tried. We found an open source dataset about cyber attacks on servers, lo and behold, we had a val accuracy of 99.8 in a single epoch of a simple feed forward net, with absolutely zero data engineering....which was way too good to be true. Upon some more EDA and some googling we found two things, one, three of the features had a correlation of more than 0.9 with the labels, which explained the ridiculous accuracy, and two, the dataset we were using had been repeatedly criticized since it's publication for being completely unlike actual data found in network traffic. This thing (the name of the dataset is kddcup99, for those interested ) was really old (published in 1999) and entirely synthetic. The people who made it completely fucked up and ended up producing a dataset that was almost linear.  To top it all off, we could find no way to extract over half of the features listed in that dataset, from real time traffic, meaning a model trained on this data could never be put into production, since there was no way to extract the correct features from the incoming data during inference. We spent the next hour searching for a better source of data, even trying out unsupervised approaches like auto encoders, finally settling on a newer, more robust dataset, generated from real data (titled UNSW-NB15, published 2015, not the most recent my InfoSec standards, but its the best we could find).  Cue almost 18 straight, sleepless hours of determining feature importance, engineering and structuring the data (for eg. we had to come up with our own solutions to representing IP addresses and port numbers, since encoding either through traditional approaches like one-hot was just not possible), iterating through different models,finding out where the model was messing up, and preprocessing data to counter that, setting up pipelines for taking data captures in raw pcap format, converting them into something that could be fed to the model, testing out the model one random pcap files found around the internet, simulating both postive and negative conditions (we ran port scanning attacks on our own machines and fed the data of the network traffic captured during the attack to the model), making sure the model was behaving as expected with a balanced accuracy, recall and f1_score, and after all this we finally built a web interface where the user could actually monitor their network traffic and be alerted if there were any anomalies detected, getting a full report of what kind of anomaly, from what IP, at what time, etc.  After all this we finally settled on using a RandomForestClassifier, because the DL approaches we tried kept messing up because of the highly skewed data (good accuracy, shit recall) whereas randomforests did a far better job handling that. We had a respectable 98.8 Acc on the test set, and similar recall value of 97.6. We didn't know how the other teams had done but we were satisfied with our work.  During the judging round, after 15 minutes of explaining all of the above to them, the only question the dude asked us was ""so you said you used a nueral network with 99.8 Accuracy, is that what your final result is based on?"". We then had to once again explain why that 99.8 accuracy was absolutely worthless, considering the data itself was worthless and how Neural Nets hadn't shown themselves to be very good at handling data imbalance (which is important considering the fact that only a tiny percentage of all network traffic is anomalous). The judge just muttered ""so its not a Neural net"", to himself, and walked away.  We lost the competetion, but I was genuinely excited to know what approach the winning team took until i asked them, and found out ....they used a fucking neural net on kddcup99 and that was all that was needed. Is that all that mattered to the dude? That they used ""deep learning"". What infuriated me even more was this team hadn't done anything at all with the data, they had no fucking clue that it was broken, and when i asked them if they had used a supervised feed forward net or unsupervised autoencoders, the dude looked at me as if I was talking in Latin....so i didnt even lose to a team using deep learning , I lost to one pretending to use deep learning.  I know i just sound like a salty loser but it's just incomprehensible to me. The judge was a representative of a startup that very proudly used ""Machine Learning to enhance their Cyber Security Solutions, to provide their users with the right security for todays multi cloud environment""....and they picked a solution with horrible recall, tested on an unreliable dataset, that could never be put into production over everything else ( there were two more teams thay used approaches similar to ours but with slightly different preprocessing and final accuracy metrics). But none of that mattered...they judged entirely based on two words. Deep. Learning.

There were two other 7-8 month old threads ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cae59l/d_advanced_courses_update/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cjnund/d_what_are_your_favorite_videos_lectures_on/)) but they don't have many quality responses either.  So, can we have a new one here? To reiterate - CS231n, CS229, ones from Udemy etc are not advanced.  Advanced ML/DL/RL, attempts at building theory of DL, optimization theory, advanced applications etc are some examples of what I believe should belong here, much like the original sidebar post. You can also suggest (new) categories for the courses you share. :) - - - Here are some courses we've found so far.

fgo70f,"From their [page](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020/virtual): # ICLR2020 as a Fully Virtual Conference Due to growing concerns about COVID-19, ICLR2020 will cancel its physical conference this year, instead shifting to a fully virtual conference. We were very excited to hold ICLR in Addis Ababa, and it is disappointing that we will not all be able to come together in person in April. This unfortunate event does give us the opportunity to innovate on how to host an effective remote conference. The organizing committees are now working to create a virtual conference that will be valuable and engaging for both presenters and attendees.  Immediate guidance for authors, and questions about registration and participation are given below. We are actively discussing several options, with full details to be announced soon.  ## Information for Authors of Accepted Papers All accepted papers at the virtual conference will be presented using a pre-recorded video.  All accepted papers (poster, spotlight, long talk) will need to create a 5 minute video that will be used during the virtual poster session. In addition, papers accepted as a long-talk should create a 15 minute video. We will provide more detailed instructions soon, particularly on how to record your presentations. In the interim, please do begin preparing your talk and associated slides.  Each video should use a set of slides, and should be timed carefully to not exceed the time allocation. The slides should be in widescreen format (16:9), and can be created in any presentation software that allows you to export to PDF (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, Beamer, etc).  ## Virtual Conference Dates The conference will still take place between April 25 and April 30, as these are the dates people have allocated to attend the conference. We expect most participants will still commit their time during this window to participate in the conference, and have discussions with fellow researchers around the world.  ## Conference Registration Fee The registration fee will be substantially reduced to 50 USD for students and 100 USD for non-students. For those who have already registered, we will automatically refund the remainder of the registration fee, so that you only pay this new reduced rate. Registration provides each participant with an access code to participate in sessions where they can ask questions of speakers, see questions and answers from other participants, take part in discussion groups, meet with sponsors, and join groups for networking. Registration furthermore supports the infrastructure needed to host and support the virtual conference.  ## Registration Support  There will be funding available for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to get registration reimbursed, with similar conditions to the Travel Support Application. If you have already applied for and received a travel grant for ICLR 2020, you will get free registration for ICLR 2020. The Travel Application on the website will be updated soon, to accept applications for free registration, with the deadline extended to April 10, 2020.  ## Workshops We will send details for workshops through the workshop organisers soon, but it is expected that these will follow a similar virtual format to the main conference. https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020/virtual","Man, this will suck for networking :/",57
fh2rr6,"Hello there.   I'm not a machine learning guy (perhaps one day!), but it was suggested to me that some of you may want a crack at this data. Using JHU's time\_series\_19-covid-Confirmed.csv csv format, and going back to 1/1/20, using Dark Sky's API, I went and grabbed the following pieces of data for each day for each site: * Cloud cover * Dew point * Relative humidity * Ozone * Precipitation probability * Air pressure * Sunrise time * Sunset time * Max temperature * Min temperature * UV index * Wind speed These are all recorded as CSV files in the /csv folder. If any of you want to use this to take a crack at trying to figure out if any of these factors play into the spread of the virus, by all means, please do so. You can correlate my values with JHU's numbers in terms of rate of spread and all that from their repository that I branched off of. The big caveat here is that I'm just a guy, and none of my data have been audited or validated or anything, but at least it's something, I guess. &#x200B;  [Here is my git repository](https://github.com/imantsm/COVID-19)",Thanks mate.

fhveru,"I was trying to read about Natural Gradient Descent today, and found the Wikipedia section[1] to read just like an ad for a different technique[2]. I thought to myself that surely it must be a big deal to be in the Wikipedia article of SGD alongside RMSProp and Adam, but it turned out to be a paper for 2015 with 21 citations (not that citations are the measure of good science, but the maximally optimistic light would still be that it would be too early to include that along the canonical optimization algorithms of the field). This seemed fishy to me so I did some digging. It was added to the Wikipedia article on Febuary 2017 [3], which at the time, the paper appears to have had 0 citations[4], by user Vp314 [5] on Wikipedia, which also happened to be the author's gmail username [6]. Furthermore the only edits that user has done on Wikipedia are related to adding their technique to the Wikipedia page on SGD [5]: one to add the original section[7], one to make a minor correction, and one to re-add that section[8] (in April 2018) after it was deleted with the comment ""Removed a recent extension which has been hardly cited by anyone in the academic community. Its appearance in Wikipedia made it look like an established technique, which is not"" [9]. My instincts are what this person has done is wrong and taking advantage of Wikipedia, but I would love to hear some other perspectives (and maybe get a little less angry).

fkgfax,"Welp, I realize that many of you are about to receive feedback in a couple weeks which will most likely be a reject from ICML. I realize that its difficult to stomach rejection, and I empathize with you as I'm submitting as well and will likely get a reject as well. But please, please, please, please, as someone who has already spent 20-30 hours reviewing this week, and will likely be spending another 30-40 hours this week on the reviewing process. Please! Stop submitting unfinished work to conferences. At this point more than half of the papers I'm reviewing are clearly unfinished work. They have significant, unmistakable flaws to the point that no reasonable person can believe that this work could possibly appear in a peer reviewed, top tier conference. No reasonable person can put these submitted papers next to even the worst ICML paper from the last few years, and believe that yeah, they're of similar or higher quality. Please take the time to get your work reviewed by your peers, or even your advisor prior to submission. If they can find \*any\* flaw in your work, I assure you, your reviewers are going to find so many flaws and give you a hurtful, and demoralizing review. I realize that we're all in a huge hype bubble, and we all want to ride the hype train, but reviewing these unfinished works makes me feel so disrespected by the authors. They're clearly submitting for early feedback. It's not fair to the conference system and the peer review process to ask your reviewers to do \*unpaid\* research work for you and advise you on how to construct and present your work. It's not fair to treat your reviewers as free labor. It takes me at a \*minimum\* 6-7 hours to review one paper, and more likely 10+ hours. That's 10+ hours of my life that these authors think is entitled to them to help them in their research so they can get published. It makes me feel so disrespected, and quite honestly, makes me want to give up on signing up as a reviewer if this is the quality of work I am expected to review. Not only are these authors being selfish, but they're hurting the overall research community, conference quality, and the peer review process. More unfinished work being submitted, means reviewers have a higher workload. We don't get to spend as much time on each paper as we would like to, meaning \*good well written deserving papers\* either get overlooked, unfairly rejected, or get terrible feedback. This is simply unacceptable! These authors, quite honestly, are acting like those people who hoard toilet paper during an epidemic. They act selfishly to the detriment of the community, putting themselves above both the research process, and other authors who submit good work. Please, please, PLEASE don't do this. Submit finished, good work, that you think is ready for publication and peer review. &#x200B; Edit: Thanks for the gold award kind stranger. You make me feel a little better about my week. Edit2: Thanks for the platinum. Thanks for the support/discussion guys. &#x200B;","I honestly appreciate the effort you put into reviewing and giving honest feedback. However ""It takes me at a \*minimum\* 6-7 hours to review one paper, and more likely 10+ hours."" is where you go wrong. If a paper is clearly not ready for publication, briefly summarize the 2-3 biggest flaws and say ""the paper is clearly not ready for publication"". Don't feel guilty about it, if the authors don't pay attention to their paper, neither should you. Such papers should take an hour tops to review. If it takes you more, try and figure out how you could spot these flaws faster, it is a good exercise :)",276
fmg41r,"First, this rant is not against people that really know their stuff, knowing the limits of ML and other approaches. Too many people in the recent years looked at machine learning approaches as a sort of silver bullet solutions. The approach seems like: ""ah you build a neural network (or whatever other technique that sounds cool) and after a bit of time it should quickly find the solutions for your"". Then they proceed to mention deepmind achievements with alphazero, muzero, alphago, alphastar and so on. Some months ago I read here, if I am not mistaken, a nice subthread in a discussion where some people pointed out that it all depends on how good the domain is modeled.   If the domain is incomplete, inaccurate or wrong, the most effective machine learning techniques won't help. Some people, correctly, pointed out that one cannot boast ML methods if at the end the problem is not properly modeled. The best example to me is the current pandemic. If those methods would be a that effective, we *could* expect quick solutions. Instead modeling the problem of a disease in a human body is so complex that good luck. Surely it will be eventually done, even if with good approximations, but to get the point - that the domain has to be properly simulated - into the most hyped people is really hard. And even when the simulation is proper, it is not granted that a good solution will be found. That is really frustrating at times in a discussion. Sometimes one reads ""Go is incredibly complex, why shouldn't they achieve a similar goal for real life problems"", and that shows how people underestimate reality.","I think part of what's happening is that we don't know what is well-modeled in a lot of domains, and there is not enough theoretical foundation to give us an answer to a lot of scenarios. So since computing is a low barrier nowadays and there are plenty of interested people, why not just let them take a shot in the dark, sort of applying a random algorithm approach.",283
fni5ow,"**Edit 2:** Both the repo and the post were deleted. Redacting identifying information as the author has appeared to make rectifications, and it’d be pretty damaging if this is what came up when googling their name / GitHub (hopefully they’ve learned a career lesson and can move on).  **TL;DR:** A PhD candidate claimed to have achieved 97% accuracy for coronavirus from chest x-rays. Their post gathered thousands of reactions, and the candidate was quick to recruit branding, marketing, frontend, and backend developers for the project. Heaps of praise all around. He listed himself as a Director of XXXX (redacted), the new name for his project.  The accuracy was based on a training dataset of ~30 images of lesion / healthy lungs, sharing of data between test / train / validation, and code to train ResNet50 from a PyTorch tutorial.   Nonetheless, thousands of reactions and praise from the “AI | Data Science | Entrepreneur” community.  **Original Post:** I saw this post circulating on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6645711949554425856-9Dhm Here, a PhD candidate claims to achieve great performance with “ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE” to predict coronavirus, asks for more help, and garners tens of thousands of views. The repo housing this ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE solution already has a backend, front end, *branding*, a README translated in 6 languages, and a call to spread the word for this wonderful technology. Surely, I thought, this researcher has some great and novel tech for all of this hype? I mean dear god, we have *branding*, and the author has listed himself as the *founder of an organization* based on this project. Anything with this much attention, with dozens of “AI | Data Scientist | Entrepreneur” members of LinkedIn praising it, must have some great merit, right?  Lo and behold, we have ResNet50, from torchvision.models import resnet50, with its linear layer replaced. We have a training dataset of 30 images. This should’ve taken at MAX 3 hours to put together - 1 hour for following a tutorial, and 2 for obfuscating the training with unnecessary code.  I genuinely don’t know what to think other than this is bonkers. I hope I’m wrong, and there’s some secret model this author is hiding? If so, I’ll delete this post, but I looked through the repo and (REPO link redacted) that’s all I could find.  I’m at a loss for thoughts. Can someone explain why this stuff trends on LinkedIn, gets thousands of views and reactions, and gets loads of praise from “expert data scientists”?

fzss9t,"This is more of a rant type of post, but it's been something that's been on my mind for a while and I'd like to know what everyone else thinks. The main idea is basically the title. Do you agree or disagree? I strongly believe that the point of conducting research of any form is to contribute to the greater body of knowledge and ultimately benefit the human race and the world we live in. Not making your code public is, in my opinion, a hindrance to this progression and should be discouraged. I've heard arguments along the lines of ""but what if I want to patent the code and make a living?"" The solution's simple: Don't write a research paper and just build the project and file for the patent. I've also heard arguments along the lines of ""but what if someone steals my idea?"" I thought this is one of the uses of preprint platforms like arXiv? Honestly though, I'm a bit baffled at how reviewers would let papers through if the code isn't public in the first place. Isn't a part of the review process for any scientific field to make sure the results are reproducible? I don't see how you'd test that unless the code's made public and you can run it.","I'm doing ML in Petroleum. No data is ever published, because it is confidential. No code is ever shared either. They rather throw some equations around to ""explain"" how their neural network works. It is all based on existing implementations in Keras, PyTorch etc, but it is not shared anyway. Why? Probably to avoid scrutiny. Everybody just writes ""we performed hyperparameter tuning and selected optimal parameters"". What are they? Who knows. It is not a problem that it is all based on existing implementations, because it is applied ML research, not strictly ML itself, but there is just no value in such publications. It gets ridiculous sometimes. Method that is not fully explained applied to an undisclosed data resulted in a model that is not shared that resulted in 98% accuracy.

g18xad,"Hi Reddit, I’m Drago Anguelov, Principal Scientist and Head of Research at Waymo. We have seen an exciting amount of interest from the community about the Waymo Open Dataset Challenges, and I am here to answer as many of your questions about the dataset and tasks as possible. Whether you’re interested in learning more about available data labels, working on your submission for the Challenges, or just curious about using machine learning for self-driving tech, I’m happy to chat. Here’s a little bit about me: I joined Waymo in 2018 to lead the Research team, where we focus on developing the state of the art in autonomous driving using machine learning. Before Waymo, I led the 3D Perception team at Zoox. I also spent eight years at Google, where I worked on pose estimation and 3D vision for StreetView and developed computer vision systems for annotating Google Photos. The computer vision team I lead at Google invented the Inception neural network architecture and the SSD detector, which helped us win the Imagenet 2014 Classification and Detection challenges. You can read about when Waymo first announced our Open Dataset for researchers here:[https://blog.waymo.com/2019/08/waymo-open-dataset-sharing-our-self.html](https://blog.waymo.com/2019/08/waymo-open-dataset-sharing-our-self.html) And more information on our Open Dataset Challenges here:[https://blog.waymo.com/2020/03/announcing-waymos-open-dataset-challenges.html](https://blog.waymo.com/2020/03/announcing-waymos-open-dataset-challenges.html) I'll be back here this Thursday, 4/16 from 11AM - 12PM PT. To make sure I make the most of the hour I have available that day, I'm posting this a little early to collect your questions. I'll try and answer as many questions as possible when I'm back! &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/bren01d2ats41.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=299198fd202749a3ae4cb5004c133d8a70ab2c41 **EDIT 10:55 AM PDT:** Hey Redditors, I’m about to get into it and there are so many questions. I’ve only got an hour so I won’t be able to answer every single question, but I’ll try and get through as many relevant ones as possible. Don't forget to check out the Waymo Open Challenges here: [https://waymo.com/open/challenges/](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/) **EDIT 11:54 AM PDT:** I’ve got an extra 30 minutes left. Trying to answer as many questions as possible. Thank you for all the thoughtful questions, everyone. **EDIT 12:34 PM PDT:** Everyone, thanks again for all your great questions! I’m on family duty so that’s all the time I have left right now. I’ll try and get back in to answer a few more later this afternoon. Thank you! **EDIT 5:25 PM PDT:** Okay everyone, I had a little more time so I just finished answering some additional questions I couldn't get to earlier. I really enjoyed this. Don't forget: The Waymo Open Dataset challenges are open through May 31! [https://waymo.com/open/challenges/](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/)","Hey there, thanks for swinging by!  Self Driving seemed to really take off a couple years ago, with every company under the sun starting their own self driving divisions and what seemed like exciting advancements coming out every week. The hype was to the point where full self driving seemed to be just around the corner, and articles were being written saying that we were going to be the last generation to need to learn how to drive.  Recently however, it seems like this optimism has soured, or at least dampened with less news grabbing headlines coming out in this space. As someone who has been very directly involved in this space, would you say that progress in this space has slowed down from a technical perspective? If so, what would you say are some of the biggest hurdles that y'all have recently run into?  On a more positive note, what sort of emerging advancements and technologies in this area are you most excited about?",26

By grounding research in its true intellectual foundations, I do not mean to diminish important contributions made by others. My goal is to encourage the entire community to be more scholarly in its efforts and to recognize the foundational work that sometimes gets lost in the frenzy of modern AI and machine learning. Here I will focus on six false and/or misleading attributions of credit to Dr. Hinton in the press release of the 2019 Honda Prize [[HON]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#HON).

Science must not allow corporate PR to distort the academic record. **[Sec. I:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#I)** Modern [backpropagation](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html) was created by Linnainmaa (1970), not by Rumelhart & Hinton & Williams (1985). Ivakhnenko's deep feedforward nets (since 1965) learned internal representations long before Hinton's shallower ones (1980s). **[Sec. II:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#II)** Hinton's unsupervised pre-training for deep NNs in the 2000s was conceptually a rehash of [my unsupervised pre-training for deep NNs](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/firstdeeplearner.html) in 1991\. And it was irrelevant for the [deep learning revolution of the early 2010s](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html) which was mostly based on supervised learning - twice my lab [spearheaded the shift from unsupervised pre-training to pure supervised learning](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019) (1991-95 and 2006-11). **[Sec. III:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#III)** The first superior end-to-end neural speech recognition was based on two methods from my lab: [LSTM](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204) (1990s-2005) and CTC (2006). Hinton et al. (2012) still used an old hybrid approach of the 1980s and 90s, and did not compare it to the revolutionary CTC-LSTM ([which was soon on most smartphones](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html)). **[Sec. IV:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#IV)** Our group at IDSIA had [superior award-winning computer vision through deep learning (2011)](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html) before Hinton's (2012). **[Sec. V:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#V)** Hanson (1990) had a variant of ""dropout"" long before Hinton (2012). **[Sec. VI:](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#VI)** In the [2010s](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html), most major AI-based services across the world [(speech recognition, language translation, etc.) on billions of devices](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html) were mostly based on our deep learning techniques, not on Hinton's. Repeatedly, Hinton [omitted](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html#conclusion) references to fundamental prior art (Sec.

However, as Elvis Presley put it: **_“Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain't goin' away.”_** *Link to full blog post: http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html*","I really value Jürgen as a Deep Learning researcher, however, his claims need some additional context: * **Seppo Linnainmaa** used a BP-like algorithm to reduce the numerical error made by a polynomial (Taylor) approximation of arbitrary functions. Though interesting and significant, I wouldn't call this procedure machine learning * The ""deep"" networks of **Ivakhnenko & Lapa** were trained in a one-layer-after-another fashion using some heuristic. Both of them are definitely pioneers but their approach is very different to the end-to-end learning enabled by Hinton's BP * It is true that Jürgen's group had a GPU implementation of a neural network before Hinton had (**DanNet**). However, **I:** they didn't publish the code, **II:** the award they won with it was much less competitive and known than the ImageNet challenge, and **III:** the ""excuse"" of Jürgen on why they didn't compete in ImageNet was that ""they focused on larger scale problems"" (higher resolution images), which is a very poor excuse as the images of ImageNet are quite large (500-by-500 on average), they are just downsampled to make the CNN consume less memory, and moreover, ImageNet was far from being ""solved"" at that time (I still think it is not ""solved"" today) * The ideas that Jürgen had in the **90s** are really inspiring, however they need to be put into context. Back then people thought that neural networks got stuck in **bad local minima** and perform poorly because of it. The approaches of Jürgen in the 90s ignore this problem and simply assume a ""global"" optimum can be reached by throwing gradient descent at every possible differentiable problem, i.e., the focused on what is possible with gradient descent instead of actually making it work in practice. Without the contributions of Convolutions, ReLUs, momentum, autograd, ...., all the successes of Deep Learning wouldn't be possible **To conclude: Jürgen Schmidhuber is a Deep Learning pioneer worth of having received the Turing award along with Hinton, LeCun, and Bengio**. However, without these three pioneers, today, we would train our fullly-connected neural networks with sigmoid activation and heuristics instead of BP and wonder why they get stuck in bad local minima.",294

g9urkz,"**Animal Crossing Artificial Intelligence Workshop** [http://acaiworkshop.com/](http://acaiworkshop.com/) We are announcing the first AI workshop hosted in Animal Crossing New Horizons. This is an experiment to see what it feels like to experience a workshop located in Animal Crossing. We would like to build a space for AI researchers to have meaningful interactions, and share their work.  This workshop is partially in response to the world in quarantine for Corona Virus. All academic conferences are now remote. One of the most valuable parts of conferences are the conversations and random interactions shared with colleagues. This is missing from most remote conferences. We hope to fill that void, by hosting a workshop in the virtual space of Animal Crossing, while having Zoom rooms where attendees can network and have conversations. The talks will be presented in a workshop area on an Animal Crossing Island. The actual audio, slide shows, and the virtual conference space will be live streamed to all attendees over Zoom.  ​ **Call for Abstracts** We welcome abstract submissions from any domain of AI, however we highly encourage presentations in the following fields:   ​ * Computational models of narrative * Automatic speech recognition * Image generation  * Natural language understanding * Conversational AI * Computer vision * Computational creativity * Music information retrieval * Automatic musical understanding * Video game AI We are highlighting these topics due to their relationship to Animal Crossing and interacting with virtual characters. These fields have the potential to affect the depth of the interactions between people and virtual characters in any context, be they Animal Crossing villagers, virtual companions, or even virtual teachers.  If you are interested in submitting, please head over to the [Submit an Abstract](http://acaiworkshop.com/submit-an-abstract.html) page. [http://acaiworkshop.com/submit-an-abstract.html](http://acaiworkshop.com/submit-an-abstract.html) ​ **Presentation Logistics** Each presentation will be 15 minutes long, followed by 5 minutes of questions from the audience. There are two components to each presentation: 1) Your Animal Crossing character will *give* the presentation in a workshop area on our workshop island. There will be workshop attendees on the island to *listen* to your talk. 2) You will call into a Zoom room, and give your talk over video call. You can also share your screen if you wish to use slides or whatever visual materials you desire.  **Coffee Breaks + Chance Interactions** ☕☕☕☕ Since our desire is to replicate the social interactions of a real workshop, we will schedule coffee breaks into the workshop. We will have many different Zoom rooms so that smaller conversations can happen simultaneously. We want to provide a virtual space for you (the participant) to meet other researchers, and make meaningful connections.  **Organizers** This workshop is being organized by me, [Josh Eisenberg](http://www.research-josh.com/) PhD. I am an NLU researcher who focuses on teaching computers to understand narrative and dialogue. I am currently the lead scientist in NLU at [Artie Inc](http://artie.com/). I am putting this workshop together to build meaningful connections with other like-minded AI researchers, who also just happen to enjoy Animal Crossing. If you have any questions or feedback please contact me at: [joshuadeisenberg@gmail.com](mailto:joshuadeisenberg@gmail.com) **Dates** Deadline for abstract submission: Friday June 12, 2020   Notification of acceptance: Friday June 26, 2020   Workshop: Thursday July 24, 2020 **Registration** If you want to attend the workshop please fill out the registration form: http://acaiworkshop.com/registration.html This will put you on a list, so that you are given credentials to visit the workshop islands in Animal Crossing and watch the conference on Zoom.  If you are planning on submitting an abstract so that you can present please fill out this form: http://acaiworkshop.com/submit-an-abstract.html  **UPDATE: if you don't have a switch or AC you can still participate through Zoom. My last intention is to prevent anyone from participating due to finances. We will work with you to create an avatar for your talk. Feel free to submit even if you don't have AC.** **Also, my animal crossing friend code is:    SW-3513-0635-4614** **UPDATE 2: Wednesday April 29*** I made an official twitter account for updates: https://twitter.com/ACAIWorkshop Also, wanted to thank everyone for all the support. We have over 150 registrations for attendees, and over 5 abstract proposals. Congrats everyone.

gonna8,"I understand how mind blowing the potential of deep learning is, but the truth is, majority of companies in the world dont care about it, or do not need that level of machine learning expertise. If we want to democratize machine learning we have to acknowledge the fact the most people Learning all the cool generative neural networks will not end up working for Google or Facebook. What I see is that most youngsters join this bandwagon of machine learning with hopes of working on these mind-blowing ideas, but when they do get a job at a descent company with a good pay, but are asked to produce ""medicore"" models, they feel like losers. I dont know when, but somewhere in this rush of deep learning, the spirit of it all got lost. Since when did the people who use Gradient Boosting, Logistic regression, Random Forest became oldies and medicore. The result is that, most of the guys we interwiew for a role know very little about basics and hardly anything about the underlying maths. The just know how to use the packages on already prepared data. Update : Thanks for all the comments, this discussion has really been enlightening for me and an amazing experience, given its my first post in reddit. Thanks a lot for the Gold Award, it means a lot to me. Just to respond to some of the popular questions and opinions in the comments. 1. Do we expect people to have to remember all the maths of the machine learning? No ways, i dont remember 99% of what i studied in college. But thats not the point. When applying these algorithms, one must know the underlying principles of it, and not just which python library they need to import. 2. Do I mean people should not work on Deep Learning or not make a hype of it, as its not the best thing? Not at all, Deep Learning is the frontier of Machine Learning and its the mind blowing potential of deep learning which brought most of us into the domain. All i meant was, in this rush to apply deep learning to everything, we must not lose sight of simpler models, which most companies across the world still use and would continue to use due to there interpretability. 3. What do I mean by Democratization of ML. ML is a revolutionary knowledge, we can all agree on that, and therefore it is essential that such knowledge be made available to all the people, so they can learn about its potential and benifit from the changes it brings to there lives, rather then being intimidated by it.

Uber AI started as an acquisition of Geometric Intelligence, which was founded in October 2014 by three professors: Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist from NYU, also well-known as an author; Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor of machine learning and Fellow of the Royal Society; Kenneth Stanley, a professor of computer science at the University of Central Florida and pioneer in evolutionary approaches to machine learning; and Douglas Bemis, a recent NYU graduate with a PhD in neurolinguistics. Other team members included Noah Goodman (Stanford), Jeff Clune (Wyoming) and Jason Yosinski (a recent graduate of Cornell). I would like to use this post as an opportunity for redditors to mention any work done by Uber AI that they feel deserves recognition. Any work mentioned here ([https://eng.uber.com/research/?\_sft\_category=research-ai-ml](https://eng.uber.com/research/?_sft_category=research-ai-ml)) or here ([https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/ai/](https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/ai/)) is fair game.

One reason why I find this research fascinating is encapsulated in the quote below: ""Right now, the majority of the field is engaged in what I call the manual path to AI. In the first phase, which we are in now, everyone is manually creating different building blocks of intelligence. The assumption is that at some point in the future our community will finish discovering all the necessary building blocks and then will take on the Herculean task of putting all of these building blocks together into an extremely complex thinking machine. That might work, and some part of our community should pursue that path. However, I think a faster path that is more likely to be successful is to rely on learning and computation: the idea is to create an algorithm that itself designs all the building blocks and figures out how to put them together, which I call an AI-generating algorithm. Such an algorithm starts out not containing much intelligence at all and bootstraps itself up in complexity to ultimately produce extremely powerful general AI. That’s what happened on Earth.  The simple Darwinian algorithm coupled with a planet-sized computer ultimately produced the human brain. I think that it’s really interesting and exciting to think about how we can create algorithms that mimic what happened to Earth in that way. Of course, we also have to figure out how to make them work so they do not require a planet-sized computer."" - [Jeff Clune](https://eng.uber.com/jeff-clune-interview/) **Please share any Uber AI research you feel deserves recognition!** This post is meant just as a show of appreciation to the researchers who contributed to the field of AI. **This post is not just for the people mentioned above, but the other up-and-coming researchers who also contributed to the field while at Uber AI and might be searching for new job opportunities.** **Please limit comments to Uber AI research only and not the company itself.**","It’s not pure ML, but the [pyro](https://pyro.ai) probabilistic programming library is quite nice.",304

hbzd5o,"The deadline for submitting papers to the NeurIPS 2020 conference was two weeks ago. Since then, almost everyday I come across long Twitter threads from ML researchers that publicly advertise their work (obviously NeurIPS submissions, from the template and date of the shared arXiv preprint). They are often quite famous researchers from Google, Facebook... with thousands of followers and therefore a high visibility on Twitter. These posts often get a lot of likes and retweets - see examples in comment. While I am glad to discover new exciting works, I am also concerned by the impact of such practice on the review process. I know that submissions of arXiv preprints are not forbidden by NeurIPS, but this kind of very engaging public advertising brings the anonymity violation to another level. Besides harming the double-blind review process, I am concerned by the social pressure it puts on reviewers. It is definitely harder to reject or even criticise a work that already received praise across the community through such advertising, especially when it comes from the account of a famous researcher or a famous institution. However, in recent Twitter discussions associated to these threads, I failed to find people caring about these aspects, notably among top researchers reacting to the posts. Would you also say that this is fine (as, anyway, we cannot really assume that a review is double-blind when arXiv public preprints with authors names and affiliations are allowed)? Or do you agree that this can be a problem?","At the risk of being downvoted into oblivion, let me put my thoughts here. I strongly feel that double-blind review, as it is done in ML or CV conferences, are a big sham. For all practical purposes, it is a single-blind system under the guise of double-blind. The community is basically living in a make-belief world where arXiv and social media don't exist. The onus is completely on the reviewers to act as if they live in silos. This is funny as many of the reviewers in these conferences are junior grad students whose job is to be updated with the literature. I don't need to pen down the probability that these folks would come across the same paper on arXiv or via social media. This obviously leads to bias in the final reviews by these reviewers. Imagine being a junior grad student trying to reject a paper from a bigshot professor because it's not good enough as per him. The problem gets only worse. People from these well-established labs will sing high praise about the papers on social media. If the bias before was for ""a paper coming from a bigshot lab"", now it becomes ""why that paper is so great"". Finally, there is a question about domain conflict (which is made into a big deal on reviewing portals). I don't understand how this actually helps when more often than not, the reviewers know whose paper they are reviewing. Here is an example, consider this paper: End to End Object Detection with Transformers [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872v1). The first version of the paper was uploaded right in the middle of the rebuttal phase of ECCV. How does it matter? Well, the first version of the paper even contains the ECCV submission ID. This is coming from a prestigious lab with a famous researcher as a first author. This paper was widely discussed on this subreddit and had the famous Facebook's PR behind it. Will this have any effect on the post-rebuttal discussion? Your guess is as good as mine. (Note: I have nothing against this paper in particular, and this example is merely to demonstrate my point. If anything, I quite enjoyed reading it). One can argue that this is a problem of the reviewer as he is not supposed to ""review a paper and not search for them arXiv"". In my view, this is asking a lot from the reviewer, who has a life beyond reviewing papers.  We are only fooling ourselves if we think we live in the 2000's when no social media existed and papers used to be reviewed by well-established PhDs. We all rant about the quality of the reviews. The quality of the reviews is a function of both the reviewers AND the reviewing process. If we need better reviews, we need to fix both parts. Having said this, I don't see the system is changing at all. The people who are in a position to make decisions about this are exactly those who are currently benefiting from such a system. I sincerely hope that this changes soon though. Peer review is central to science. It is not difficult to see how some of the research areas which were previously quite prestigious, like psychology, have become in absence of such a system \[Large quantity of papers in these areas don't have proper experiment setting or are peer-reviewed, and are simply put out in public, resulting in a lot of pseudo scientific claims\]. I hope our community doesn't follow the same path. I will end my rant by saying ""Make the reviewers AND the reviewing process great again""!",110
heiyqq,"I know people on this sub have likely had their fill of fairness and bias related discussions the past few days, but I feel compelled to point out a letter (and associated petition) to the editors of Springer Nature asking them not to publish a paper purporting to identify likely criminals from images of faces. &nbsp; https://medium.com/@CoalitionForCriticalTechnology/abolish-the-techtoprisonpipeline-9b5b14366b16 &nbsp; Nevermind that this type of research direction has been demonstrated to be fatally flawed in the past. The fact that this work is being legitimized with a peer reviewed stamp of approval makes me wonder when the first ML phrenology paper will surface. &nbsp; I think the important takeaway is understanding the differing definitions of bias. The letter makes it clear that the authors claim to “predict if someone is a criminal based solely on a picture of their face,” with “80 percent accuracy and with no racial bias.” The problem being that by using the phrase “no racial bias” they are conflating the issue of algorithmic bias with the societal notion of bias. The letter spells out the societal aspect quite well: > Let’s be clear: there is no way to develop a system that can predict or identify “criminality” that is not racially biased — because the category of “criminality” itself is racially biased. &nbsp; Maybe we have a terminology issue that we as an ML community need to address so we can better convey the distinction between algorithmic bias (which may or may not be desirable depending on the desired result) versus the societal notion of bias, which can be codified in the datasets we use. &nbsp; Anyway, despite the length of the letter, I think it’s an important read as it clearly elucidates a number of the issues that have been discussed around fairness in ML. I also urge people to sign the petition and email Springer Nature your concerns if you feel so inclined. &nbsp; EDIT: Looks like the petition worked pretty quickly. Springer Nature isn’t going to publish the paper, though I would still urge people to read the linked letter (and the excellent footnotes) and potentially still show solidarity by signing the petition. https://twitter.com/SpringerNature/status/1275477365196566528","The press release from the authors is wild. >Sadeghian said. “This research indicates just how powerful these tools are by showing they can extract minute features in an image that are highly predictive of criminality.” >“By automating the identification of potential threats without bias, our aim is to produce tools for crime prevention, law enforcement, and military applications that are less impacted by implicit biases and emotional responses,” Ashby said. “Our next step is finding strategic partners to advance this mission.” I don't really know anything about this Springer book series, but based on the fact that they accepted this work, I assume it's one of those pulp journals that will publish anything?  It sounds like the authors are pretty hopeful about selling this to police departments.  Maybe they wanted a publication to add some legitimacy to their sales pitch.",218
hiv3vf,"It is omnipresent! **First** of all, the peer-review process is *broken*. Every fourth NeurIPS submission is put on arXiv. There are DeepMind researchers publicly going after reviewers who are criticizing their ICLR submission. On top of that, papers by well-known institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection. In contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the AC. (I don't want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this year's ICRL). **Secondly,** there is a *reproducibility crisis*. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any. **Thirdly,** there is a *worshiping* problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. At every ICML conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every DeepMind poster, regardless of the content of the work. The same story happened with the Zoom meetings at the virtual ICLR 2020. Moreover, NeurIPS 2020 had twice as many submissions as ICML, even though both are top-tier ML conferences. Why? Why is the name ""neural"" praised so much? Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the ""godfathers"" of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult. **Fourthly**, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. However, the *toxicity* and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity. Getting rid of LeCun and silencing people won't solve any issue. **Fifthly**, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge *diversity problem*. At our CS faculty, only 30% of undergrads and 15% of the professors are women. Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career. However, this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism.  Reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem. **Sixthly**, moral and ethics are set *arbitrarily*. The U.S. domestic politics dominate every discussion. At this very moment, thousands of Uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. Adding a ""broader impact"" section at the end of every people will not make this stop. There are huge shitstorms because a researcher wasn't mentioned in an article. Meanwhile, the 1-billion+ people continent of Africa is virtually excluded from any meaningful ML discussion (besides a few Indaba workshops). **Seventhly**, there is a cut-throat publish-or-perish *mentality*. If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a looser. Research groups have become so large that the PI does not even know the name of every PhD student anymore. Certain people submit 50+ papers per year to NeurIPS. The sole purpose of writing a paper has become to having one more NeurIPS paper in your CV. Quality is secondary; passing the peer-preview stage has become the primary objective. **Finally**, discussions have become *disrespectful*. Schmidhuber calls Hinton a thief, Gebru calls LeCun a white supremacist, Anandkumar calls Marcus a sexist, everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved. Albert Einstein was opposing the theory of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Einstein's_objections_to_quantum_mechanics). Can we please stop demonizing those who do not share our exact views. We are allowed to disagree without going for the jugular.  The moment we start silencing people because of their opinion is the moment scientific and societal progress dies.  Best intentions, Yusuf","We actually wrote a paper regarding some of the above points. Kind of a self-criticism: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07633 Some other points we touched: ""lack of hypothesis"" & ""chronic allergy to negative results""  And we discussed (without claiming always applicable) the possibility of results-blind peer review process.",553
hkiyir,"Google has some serious cultural problems with proper credit assignment. They continue to rename methods discovered earlier DESPITE admitting the existence of this work. See this new paper they released: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14536](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14536) Stop calling this method SWISH; its original name is SILU.

Cihang Xie's work is not the cause of this issue. Their paper does not claim to discover a new activation function. They are only using the SiLU activation function in some of their experiments under the name Swish.

The cause of the issue is Google in the past decided to continue with renaming the activation as [Swish despite being made aware of the method already having the name SiLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941).

hnx1jn,"For example, I have 2 hot takes: 1. Over the next couple years, someone will come up with an optimizer/optimization approach that completely changes how people optimize neural networks. In particular, there's quite some evidence that the neural network training doesn't quite work how we think it is. For one, there's several papers showing that very early stages of training are far more important than the rest of training. There's also other papers isolating interesting properties of training like the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. 2. GANs are going to get supplanted by another generative model paradigm - probably VAEs, flow-based methods, or energy-based models. I think there's just too many issues with GANs - in particular lack of diversity. Despite the 50 papers a year claiming to solve mode collapse, oftentimes GANs still seem to have issues with representatively sampling the data distribution (e.g: PULSE). What are yours?","Intuitive ""interpretability"" of deep NNs is a false promise and will not be delivered on. Interpretability is only valid if the question is well-posed. * ""Why does the model make this prediction?"" is well-posed, and the answer is very boring: you take your inputs and put it through this explicitly mathematically specified function. That's why it makes that prediction. * ""What is the human-intuitive reason the model makes this prediction?"" is not well-posed. There may not be, and probably isn't, a ""human-intuitive"" explanation for why a model does what it does or interpretation of what's going on. To be clear, mathematical or empirical analyses of models is good and valid. But asking for an ""interpretation"" of a model or representation space is more often than not forcing the model/method to lie to you for the sake of having a nice plot on page 6/7 of the paper. </hot-take>",253
hrawam,"EDIT: Someone replied to the issue, this is what was said: >It looks like what's going on is: The layers currently enter a 'functional api construction' mode only if all of the inputs in the first argument come from other Keras layers. However, you have None included in the inputs in the first positional arg, so it's not triggering functional api construction. >That causes the layer to get 'inlined' in the outer functional model rather than correctly included. You should be able to work around this by changing the layer api so Nones should not get passed in. >We have a major cleanup/refactoring of the Functional API mostly done that make the functional api triggering much clearer (if any symbolic values appear in the inputs) & sort out a number of other issues w/ it. But, that will only land in 2.4. It's not immediately obvious if we can squeeze a fix into tf 2.3 as the RC is already out. If you look at the notebooks, the inputs to some of the lines look like this: `    P_outputs = P_trans11((inputHiddenVals, None, None, None))[0]` It looks like the issue is that the  are extra `None`s are causing disappearing variables issue, and a workaround could be just to have  `    P_outputs = P_trans11(inputHiddenVals)[0]`   ---- tl'dr: For anyone who has used the functional api with custom layers, it might be worth running      for i, var in enumerate(model.trainable_variables):         print(model.trainable_variables[i].name)      so see if all your weights are there.  ---- Using custom layers with the functional API results in missing weights in the `trainable_variables`. Those weights are not in the `non_trainable_variables` either.  But if those weights aren't in `trainable_variables`they are essential frozen, since it is only those weights that receive gradient updates, as seen in the Keras model training code below: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1fb8f4988d69237879aac4d9e3f268f837dc0221/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L2729        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_variables)            # Whether to aggregate gradients outside of optimizer.

For an in-depth look, the colab gist below creates all the custom layers from scratch https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Santosh-Gupta/aa34086a72956600910976e4f7ebe323/model_weight_debug_scratch_public_inference_var.ipynb  As you can see in the notebooks, a workaround is to create models using keras subclassing instead; model subclassing results in all the weights appearing in `trainable_variables`. To be absolutely sure that the functional API and subclasses models are exactly the same, I ran inference on them using the same input at the bottom of each notebook; the outputs for the models were exactly the same. But training using the functional API model would treat many of the weights as frozen (and there's no way to make them unfrozen since those weights aren't registered in the `non_trainable_variables` either).  I've been looking at this for about a month, as far as I can tell, I don't think there was anything unique about the transformer layer I created; it may be the case that Any Keras model using custom sublayers and the functional API is prone to this.  I put up a Github issue 24 days ago, but I can't tell if this is something being worked on.  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/40638 If anyone else has been using the Keras functional API with custom layer, would love to hear if you're also getting the same issue when you check the trainable variables.","Response on issue: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/40638#issuecomment-658491989 > It looks like what's going on is: The layers currently enter a 'functional api construction' mode only if all of the inputs in the first argument come from other Keras layers.

hzdiru,"TL;DR: The only thing worse than not providing code is saying you did and not following through. I'm frustrated, so this might be a little bit of a rant but here goes: I cannot believe that it is acceptable in highly ranked conferences to straight-up lie about the availability of code. Firstly, obviously it would be great if everyone released their code all the time because repeatability in ML is pretty dismal at times. But if you're not going to publish your code, then don't say you are. Especially when you're leaving details out of the paper and referring the reader to said ""published"" code. Take for example [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04725), coming out of NVIDIA's research lab and published in CVPR2020. It is fairly detail-sparse, and nigh on impossible to reproduce in its current state as a result. It refers the reader to [this repository](https://github.com/NVlabs/wetectron) which has been a single readme since its creation. It is simply unacceptable for this when the paper directly says the code has been released. As top conferences are starting to encourage the release of code, I think there needs to be another component: the code must actually be available. Papers that link to empty or missing repositories within some kind of reasonable timeframe of publication should be withdrawn. It should be unacceptable to direct readers to code that doesn't exist for details, and similarly for deleting repositories shortly after publication. I get that this is logistically a little tough, because it has to be done after publication, but still we can't let this be considered okay EDIT: To repeat the TL;DR again and highlight the key point - There won't always be code, that's frustrating but tolerable. There is no excuse for claiming to have code available, but not actually making it available. Code should be required to be up at time of publication, and kept up for some duration, if a paper wishes to claim to have released their code.","I think if you say in your paper the code is available, and at time of publication the code isn't available, you are making unsubstantiated claims and either the paper needs an edit or the reviewer needs to point this out.

I'm currently working on a project to curate the currently massive number of ML resources, and I noticed that there are courses like CS231n or David Silver's that come up repeatedly (for a good reason). But there seems to be lots of other quality resources that don't receive as much widespread appreciation. So, here are a few **hidden gems** that, imo, deserve more love: **Causal Inference** * [Duke Causal Inference bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/ModUPowerfulConceptsinSocialScience/playlists) (2015): Over 100 videos to understand ideas like counterfactuals, instrumental variables, differences-in-differences, regression discontinuity etc. Imo, the most approachable and complete videos series on Causal Inference (although it's definitely rooted in an Economics perspective rather than CS/ML, i.e. a lot closer to Gary King's work than Bernhard Schölkopf's). * [Elements of Causal Inference](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-causal-inference) (2017): A textbook that introduces the reader to causality and some of its connections to ML. 200 pages of content on the cause-effect problem, multivariate causal models, hidden variables, time series and more. Alternatively, this [4-part lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvrcyqcN9Wo&t=1296s) by Peters goes through a lot of the same topics from the book. And for a more up-to-date survey of Causality x ML, Schölkopf's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10500) will be your best bet. * [MLSS Africa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC722CmQVgcLtxt_jXr3RyWg/videos) (2019): Beyond a collection of other great talks, this Machine Learning Summer School has recorded tutorials on Causal Discovery by Bernhard Schölkopf and Causal Inference in Everyday ML by Ferenc Huszár. For an even more recent causality tutorial by Schölkopf, head to this year's virtual MLSS [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBOgpkDhQuYeVVjuzS5Wtxw/videos). * [Online Causal Inference Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiiOj5GSES6uw21kfXnxj3A/videos) (2020-present): For a collection of talks on current research, check out this virtual seminar. Talks by researchers like Andrew Gelman, Caroline Uhler or Ya Xu will give you an overview of the frontiers of causal inference in both industry and academia. &#x200B; **Computer Vision** * [UW The Ancient Secrets of CV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjMXczUzEYcHvw5YYSU92WrY8IwhTuq7p) (2018): Created by the first author of YOLO, this is likely the most well-rounded computer vision course as it not only teaches you the deep learning side of CV but  ""older"" methods like SIFT and optical flow as well. * [UMichigan Deep Learning for CV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r) (2019): An evolution of the beloved CS231n, this course is taught by one of its former head instructors Justin Johnson.

jc1fp2,"**Abstract** Optimization is at the core of modern deep learning. We propose AdaBelief optimizer to simultaneously achieve three goals: fast convergence as in adaptive methods, good generalization as in SGD, and training stability. The intuition for AdaBelief is to adapt the stepsize according to the ""belief"" in the current gradient direction. Viewing the exponential moving average (EMA) of the noisy gradient as the prediction of the gradient at the next time step, if the observed gradient greatly deviates from the prediction, we distrust the current observation and take a small step; if the observed gradient is close to the prediction, we trust it and take a large step. We validate AdaBelief in extensive experiments, showing that it outperforms other methods with fast convergence and high accuracy on image classification and language modeling. Specifically, on ImageNet, AdaBelief achieves comparable accuracy to SGD. Furthermore, in the training of a GAN on Cifar10, AdaBelief demonstrates high stability and improves the quality of generated samples compared to a well-tuned Adam optimizer. **Links** Project page: [https://juntang-zhuang.github.io/adabelief/](https://juntang-zhuang.github.io/adabelief/) Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07468](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07468) Code: [https://github.com/juntang-zhuang/Adabelief-Optimizer](https://github.com/juntang-zhuang/Adabelief-Optimizer) Videos on toy examples: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7KkG3n9bER6YmMLrKJ5wocjlvP7aWoOu](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7KkG3n9bER6YmMLrKJ5wocjlvP7aWoOu) **Discussion** You are very welcome to post your thoughts here or at the github repo, email me, and collaborate on implementation or improvement.

jgwqe8,"*Aside from the clickbait title, I am earnestly looking for some advice and discussion from people who are actually employed. That being said, here's my gripe:* I have been relentlessly inundated by the words ""AI, ML, Big Data"" throughout my undergrad from other CS majors, business and sales oriented people, media, and <insert-catchy-name>.ai type startups. It seems like everyone was peddling ML as the go to solution, the big money earner, and the future of the field. I've heard college freshman ask stuff like, ""if I want to do CS, am I going to need to learn ML to be relevant"" - if you're on this sub, I probably do not need to continue to elaborate on just how ridiculous the ML craze is.  Every single university has opened up ML departments or programs and are pumping out ML graduates at an unprecedented rate. **Surely, there'd be a job market to meet the incredible supply of graduates and cultural interest?** Swept up in a mixture of genuine interest and hype, I decided to pursue computer vision. I majored in Math-CS at a [top-10](http://csrankings.org/#/index?all) CS university (based on at least one arbitrary ranking). I had three computer vision internships, two at startups, one at NASA JPL, in each doing non-trivial CV work; I (re)implemented and integrated CV systems from mixtures of recently published papers. I have a bunch of projects showing both CV and CS fundamentals (OS, networking, data structures, algorithms, etc) knowledge. I have taken graduate level ML coursework. I was accepted to Carnegie Mellon for an MS in Computer Vision, but I deferred to 2021 - all in all, I worked my ass off to try to simultaneously get a solid background in math AND computer science AND computer vision. That brings me to where I am now, which is unemployed and looking for jobs. Almost every single position I have seen requires a PhD and/or 5+ years of experience, and whatever I have applied for has ghosted me so far. The notion that ML is a high paying in-demand field seems to only be true if your name is Andrej Karpathy - and I'm only sort of joking. It seems like unless you have a PhD from one of the big 4 in CS and multiple publications in top tier journals you're out of luck, or at least vying for one of the few remaining positions at small companies. This seems normalized in ML, but this is not the case for quite literally every other subfield or even generalized CS positions. Getting a high paying job at a Big N company is possible as a new grad with just a bachelors and general SWE knowledge, and there are a plethora of positions elsewhere. Getting the equivalent with basically every specialization, whether operating systems, distributed systems, security, networking, etc, is also possible, and doesn't require 5 CVPR publications. **TL;DR** **From my personal perspective,** **if you want to do ML because of career prospects, salaries, or job security, pick almost any other CS specialization**. In ML, you'll find yourself working 2x as hard through difficult theory and math to find yourself competing with more applicants for fewer positions. I am absolutely complaining and would love to hear a more positive perspective, but in the meanwhile I'll be applying to jobs, working on more post-grad projects, and contemplating switching fields. ","You're running into two issues, I think: 1. There's a huge miss rate when reaching out to companies.  Recruiters help here, but there's no way around the fact that 80% of the time (or whatever) you're shouting into the void, especially if you're a new college hire without much job experience. All you can do is keep trying. Contact old recruiters who've contacted you before and ask for their help, too. Many recruiters are free-lancers and can pass your resume on to multiple companies. They get paid no matter where you're hired. 2. You may be applying for the wrong kind of job. For research positions, you absolutely need a PhD (or a really fucking impressive publication record).  However, there are lots of engineering jobs in the ML field, especially at bigger companies (Google, FB, MS, NVIDIA) that have large research staffs and that contribute significantly to open source projects. PM me if you want to talk more. I'm happy to take a look at your resume; maybe there's some simple changes you can make to look more attractive to these companies.",309

jkv7lu,"Hi everyone! I'm a software engineer at Deepnote. My team and I are working on a collaborative data science notebook – Deepnote. We have just opened the platform after a year-long closed beta, so you can try Deepnote here: [https://deepnote.com/](https://deepnote.com/). We have free plans for individuals and academia that are ideal for experimentation and publishing research. Would love to hear your thoughts! A bit more context on the product: We've built Deepnote on top of Jupyter so it has all the features you'd expect - it's Jupyter-compatible, supports Python, R and Julia and it runs in the cloud. We improve the notebooks experience with real-time collaborative editing (just like Google Docs), shared datasets and a powerful interface with features like a command palette, variable explorer and autocomplete. We want Deepnote to be an interface that empowers ML researchers to collaborate, experiment and reproduce findings easily. Looking forward to your feedback!","So just like google colab, but with actual collaboration?",34
jm0lhu,"If anyone has seen the social dilemma, you'll understand the impact FAANG recommender algorithms have on society. Not in a vague, roundabout way either. These algorithms are trained to maximize profit by influencing people's attention, information streams and priority queues. I think its truly a shame that working for Facebook, Google, YouTube, Twitter etc is seen as ""the holy grail"" as an ML engineer/ researcher.  The best paid (and therefore probably some of the most skilled) people in our field are working on thát. Not medicine, not science.. no, they work on recommender algorithms that act as catalysts for the worst in humanity, in turn for more ad revenue. A glaring (but fixed) example is a 13 year old girl watching diet videos will get anorexia videos recommended on YouTube, not because it's good for her, but because it maximizes the time she spends on YouTube to generate more ad revenue. And it works. Because it worked for thousands of other 13 year olds watching diet videos.   My apologies for a bit of a rant but I'm genuinely curious how other ML developers think about this. This is one of the biggest (or probably even THE biggest) impact that machine learning has on the world right now, yet I barely hear about it on this sub (I hope I'm wrong on this).  Do you think people that developed these algorithms bear some responsibility? Do you think they knew the impact of their algorithms? And finally, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like no one is discussing this here. Why is that?","I think that there really is a lack of pro-social efforts made across the entirety of Engineering as a discipline. People talk a lot about their salaries, but very little about whether or not what they're doing is good for the world. Yeah, some Google engineers protested building facial recognition systems to help China throw Uyghurs into camps, but not enough to actually stop them getting built. So, while recommender systems are possibly capable of harbinging the end of Democracy, there's also a ton of other monstrous shit coming out of ML. And we should be talking about all of it. But we're too concerned with SotA and salaries to give enough fucks a lot of the time.",237

jtbr8c,"I currently work on ML research and am feeling completely demotivated. I want to hear how y'all manage to stay focused and productive. At a high level, here are the main reasons why I find it hard to justify working 8+ hours a day on ML: 1. **The world is burning** (Covid, climate change, social unrest), and I'm constantly wondering what the opportunity cost is for not doing something more immediately impactful and meaningful. I try to be more humble and accept that the world doesn't need me to ""save"" it. But it also feels wrong to just hunker down and tinker with hyperparameters all day. 2. In the deep learning era, the day-to-day ML work feels like **shooting in the dark**. Honestly every time I try to do something principled and grounded in theory, reality slaps me in the face. It just doesn't work. What does work is anticlimactic: training bigger & longer, or arbitrarily tweaking BERT for whatever niche. 3. **The field is so crowded**. The arxiv firehose is overwhelming and (forgive my cynicism) so full of noise. So much gets published everyday, yet so little. There's this crazy race to publish anything, regardless how meaningless that extra layer you added to BERT is. And while I really try to keep my integrity and not write a paper about how I swept the s\*\*\* out of those hyperparameters and increased the average GLUE score by a whooping 0.2, realistically I still need to keep up with this crazy pace if I don't want to get fired. I feel trapped because I can't find pleasure neither in the process (which has become synonymous with throwing stuff at BERT and seeing what happens), nor the outcome (wasting huge amounts of compute power in a world that is burning, occasionally discovering mildly uninteresting things). At the end of the day, I'm depleted of energy and so can't rely on other areas of my life to fill in the void. Enlighten me! What's your secret? How do you keep going? Edit: Thank you all so much for your thoughtful messages / advice and for sharing your experiences.

k2pd9n,"I have been hearing some negativity about PhDs recently, much of it justified I am sure. However, as someone who has largely enjoyed their PhD in reinforcement learning, I thought I might explain some of the great things that can come from a PhD and give my advice on things to consider. My advice is not scientific and I am sure many others have written better advice you should also read\*.  That being said, here is a list of things which can make doing a PhD really satisfying: 1. A productive relationship with your advisor/supervisor. If you are lucky, you will find a supervisor who is a world expert and who responds promptly to your questions, takes interest in your ideas and suggests helpful improvements. 2. The opportunity to learn about interesting topics without expectation of concrete output. 3. Day to day work which matches the skill set you want to develop 4. The autonomy to build a project based on your own ideas 5. The expertise of the lab and your ability to collaborate, receive feedback and socialise with them 6. Getting a chance to intern with industry 7. Publishing your work at top tier conferences and journals If you can get all of these things out of your PhD it can be a really fun and worthwhile experience and, with a bit of luck, will set you up for great career opportunities afterwards. However, working things out before starting can be hard. So lets say you've narrowed it down to a few advisors, how do you evaluate points 1-7? Here are some tips: &#x200B; 1. Read carefully your potential advisor’s best publications and recent impactful work. Check if they have successfully supervised students in the past. Get in contact with current or past students to hear how they work with their supervisor currently. If you can, do a rotation project as part of a PhD program or Masters degree. 2. Find out if people in the lab have a lot of pressure to publish. If they do, it may make it difficult to learn about other areas. Is your lab/University a hub for creative ideas from a variety of perspectives with opportunities to attend interesting lectures and interact with talented people? 3. You will be an expert in the area(s) in which you do your PhD. Think about the skill set that would give you and your ability to sell that after the PhD. Equally, think about the process of acquiring those skills, and whether you would enjoy that process. 4. Does your advisor already have a narrow project laid out for you or is it a broader picture (I would recommend the latter, although it does come with more risk). Does your advisor publish across a narrow range of topics or does he or she publish work in multiple related areas? Is that work high quality or low quality? 5. Meet current lab members and try to get a sense of their interests, expertise and willingness to collaborate. If they have recent publications read them and ask them about it. 6. An internship during your PhD is great both for learning and building a career. Machine learning is unusual in its ability to provide these opportunities so take them if you can! 7. Do people in your lab regularly publish in top tier conferences and journals? Is their work widely cited, or more concretely, has it directly impacted research in the field? Finally, bear in mind that in reality it is very unlikely you have an opportunity which satisfies all these criteria, so be reasonable in your expectations, balance them against non-PhD opportunities and having evaluated all the evidence carefully, follow your gut. Good luck! Oh, and one more thing: The sunk cost fallacy is real. When thinking about your existing projects and future projects, don’t be afraid to change tack if you worked hard on an idea and it just isn’t panning out. Similarly, don’t be afraid to change supervisor and or people you collaborate with if you honestly gave it your best shot and things are not working out. Be aware of when you are spinning your wheels and not making progress and do everything you can (within reason of course) to get out of it. If things get really bad, don’t be afraid to drop out. A PhD should be about excitement and opportunity and not fear of failure. Save that for the rest of your life! \*Sources of better advice include Richard Hamming and E.O Wilson [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzPcu0-ETTU&ab\_channel=TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzPcu0-ETTU&ab_channel=TED)","Thank you, I had just started writing up a response but I think you covered most of my points. Some things I would add: Consider whether you want to work with a tenured professor vs. a younger professor. The advantage of tenured professors is that they will typically be more amenable to a hands-off approach where you can explore ideas after they do a basic sanity check on them - this will be extremely valuable if you see yourself as a creative thinker and want to take advantage of probably only time in the life where you have the freedom to try new ideas and fail. However, you will then be responsible for your work standing somewhat on its own, as your professor may not be doing popular, highly-cited research anymore. The advantage of new, tenure-track professors is that you can ride their coattails as they become more famous for cutting-edge, immediately applicable and highly-cited fields that will get a lot of funding. You could become a common name just for creating a dataset, for example. The downside is that you will be serving to help them get tenure and your work will therefore be more restricted and focused, and from my observed experiences of others, more stressful. Not to mention that they may just decide to leave the university and you're stuck deciding whether you want to uproot your life just to follow them. That being said, don't get a PhD if you think it's just the next step of schooling after Masters, as a PhD is very different from a Masters. In most cases, the Masters is focused on the courses you take, even if you have a final thesis. A PhD has courses, but they are secondary to the main focus of the program, which is teaching you how to make contributions to research. There are many people who are very smart, but aren't interested in trying new things and failing without much guidance.  If you are one of these people, you probably don't want to get a PhD.  If you're considering opportunity cost and the money, you also probably shouldn't get a PhD. In  terms of money earned over your lifetime, after taking into consideration the opportunity cost and ability to invest earnings earlier, the PhD won’t be worth it - you’ll likely break even. (This is true of many medical doctors too, btw). It will be worth it if you want to do research, however, because you can’t lead cutting-edge research without it (although you can certainly contribute  to it). It also would be worth it if you wanted to become a professor.  It’s about the career that you want - it’s not just an automatic boost in salary. I am able to work a wide variety of interesting and impactful things rather than just creating a new product that Amazon might never decide to use. I get to interact with a variety of fields, from medicine, biology, computer graphics, etc, rather than being in one division of one company.",421

k6467v,"Here is the email (according to platformer), I will post the source in a comment: Hi friends, I had stopped writing here as you may know, after all the micro and macro aggressions and harassments I received after posting my stories here (and then of course it started being moderated).  Recently however, I was contributing to a document that Katherine and Daphne were writing where they were dismayed by the fact that after all this talk, this org seems to have hired 14% or so women this year. Samy has hired 39% from what I understand but he has zero incentive to do this.  What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.  Have you ever heard of someone getting “feedback” on a paper through a privileged and confidential document to HR? Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?  Imagine this: You’ve sent a paper for feedback to 30+ researchers, you’re awaiting feedback from PR & Policy who you gave a heads up before you even wrote the work saying “we’re thinking of doing this”, working on a revision plan figuring out how to address different feedback from people, haven’t heard from PR & Policy besides them asking you for updates (in 2 months). A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar (this popped up at around 2pm). No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you “it has been decided” that you need to retract this paper by next week, Nov. 27, the week when almost everyone would be out (and a date which has nothing to do with the conference process). You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.  Then, you ask for more information. What specific feedback exists? Who is it coming from? Why now? Why not before? Can you go back and forth with anyone? Can you understand what exactly is problematic and what can be changed?  And you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you’re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored. And you’re met with, once again, an order to retract the paper with no engagement whatsoever.  Then you try to engage in a conversation about how this is not acceptable and people start doing the opposite of any sort of self reflection—trying to find scapegoats to blame.  Silencing marginalized voices like this is the opposite of the NAUWU principles which we discussed. And doing this in the context of “responsible AI” adds so much salt to the wounds. I understand that the only things that mean anything at Google are levels, I’ve seen how my expertise has been completely dismissed. But now there’s an additional layer saying any privileged person can decide that they don’t want your paper out with zero conversation. So you’re blocked from adding your voice to the research community—your work which you do on top of the other marginalization you face here.  I’m always amazed at how people can continue to do thing after thing like this and then turn around and ask me for some sort of extra DEI work or input. This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random “impact award.” Pure gaslighting.  So if you would like to change things, I suggest focusing on leadership accountability and thinking through what types of pressures can also be applied from the outside. For instance, I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus is the entity that started forcing tech companies to report their diversity numbers. Writing more documents and saying things over and over again will tire you out but no one will listen.  Timnit --------------------------------- Below is Jeff Dean's message sent out to Googlers on Thursday morning  Hi everyone,  I’m sure many of you have seen that Timnit Gebru is no longer working at Google. This is a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.  Because there’s been a lot of speculation and misunderstanding on social media, I wanted to share more context about how this came to pass, and assure you we’re here to support you as you continue the research you’re all engaged in.  Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers). We’ve approved dozens of papers that Timnit and/or the other Googlers have authored and then published, but as you know, papers often require changes during the internal review process (or are even deemed unsuitable for submission). Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted. A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why. It ignored too much relevant research — for example, it talked about the environmental impact of large models, but disregarded subsequent research showing much greater efficiencies.  Similarly, it raised concerns about bias in language models, but didn’t take into account recent research to mitigate these issues. We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper.  Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google. Given Timnit's role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re doing. I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical DEI programs. Please don’t. I understand the frustration about the pace of progress, but we have important work ahead and we need to keep at it.  I know we all genuinely share Timnit’s passion to make AI more equitable and inclusive. No doubt, wherever she goes after Google, she’ll do great work and I look forward to reading her papers and seeing what she accomplishes. Thank you for reading and for all the important work you continue to do.   -Jeff","Since this post has now been locked, please redirect all discussion to the megathread. https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k77sxz/d_timnit_gebru_and_google_megathread/",352
k77sxz,"First off, why a megathread? Since the first thread went up 1 day ago, we've had 4 different threads on this topic, all with large amounts of upvotes and hundreds of comments. Considering that a large part of the community likely would like to avoid politics/drama altogether, the continued proliferation of threads is not ideal. We don't expect that this situation will die down anytime soon, so to consolidate discussion and prevent it from taking over the sub, we decided to establish a megathread. Second, why didn't we do it sooner, or simply delete the new threads? The initial thread had very little information to go off of, and we eventually locked it as it became too much to moderate.  Subsequent threads provided new information, and (slightly) better discussion. Third, several commenters have asked why we allow drama on the subreddit in the first place. Well, we'd prefer if drama never showed up. Moderating these threads is a massive time sink and quite draining. However, it's clear that a substantial portion of the ML community would like to discuss this topic. Considering that r/machinelearning is one of the only communities capable of such a discussion, we are unwilling to ban this topic from the subreddit. Overall, making a comprehensive megathread seems like the best option available, both to limit drama from derailing the sub, as well as to allow informed discussion. We will be closing new threads on this issue, locking the previous threads, and updating this post with new information/sources as they  arise. If there any sources you feel should be added to this megathread, comment below or send a message to the mods. # Timeline: ---- **8 PM Dec 2**: Timnit Gebru posts her [original tweet](https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334352694664957952) | [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k5ryva/d_ethical_ai_researcher_timnit_gebru_claims_to/) **11 AM Dec 3**: The contents of Timnit's email to Brain women and allies leak on [platformer](https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical), followed shortly by Jeff Dean's email to Googlers responding to Timnit | [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k6467v/n_the_email_that_got_ethical_ai_researcher_timnit/) **12 PM Dec 4**: Jeff posts a [public response](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/preview?pru=AAABdlOOKBs*gTzLnuI53B2IS2BISVcgAQ) | [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k6t96m/d_jeff_deans_official_post_regarding_timnit/)  **4 PM Dec 4**: [Timnit responds to Jeff's public response](https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1335017524937756672) **9 AM Dec 5**: [Samy Bengio (Timnit's manager) voices his support for Timnit](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3469738016467233&id=100002932057665) **Dec 9**: [Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, apologized for company's handling of this incident and pledges to investigate the events](https://www.axios.com/sundar-pichai-memo-timnit-gebru-exit-18b0efb0-5bc3-41e6-ac28-2956732ed78b.html) --- **Other sources** - [Googlers (and others) sign letter standing with Timnit](https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382) - [A claimed reviewer of Timnit's paper posts the abstract](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k69eq0/n_the_abstract_of_the_paper_that_led_to_timnit/) - [A twitter thread of Timnit's contributions from Rachel Thomas](https://twitter.com/math_rachel/status/1334545393057599488) - [MIT Tech Review: We read the paper that forced Timnit Gebru out of Google.

I have a student who is working on an independent project that is waaaay beyond the CS knowledge/ability of anyone in my building.  He is investigating the question of whether an AI can create ""true art"". The student maintains a blog as a part of documenting his progress/learning and for a while I was able to give him feedback that was meaningful to some extent but at this point, as I said, he's beyond me. So -- with his permission -- I am posting a link to his blog and to his Github account.

kf86zh,"*Edit Dec 18: I misinterpreted one section of the original paper and have updated my third point under ""problem 1"" to remove inaccurate claims. I've also removed the term ""overfit"" from the tl;dr since I don't actually think that's the problem.* ***TL;DR: You can fit a model on 96 examples unrelated to Covid, publish the results in PNAS, and get Wall Street Journal Coverage about using AI to fight Covid.*** *Earlier this year, I saw a couple articles in the press with titles like ""Northwestern University Team Develops Tool to Rate Covid-19 Research"" (in the Wall Street Journal) and ""How A.I. may help solve science’s ‘reproducibility’ crisis"" (Fortune). I tracked down the original paper and found that despite being published in PNAS, it didn't hold up to scrutiny. (I know you're all shocked.) Inspired by* [*the post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/c4ylga/d_misuse_of_deep_learning_in_nature_journals/) *to this sub on the questionable Nature paper that used* *~~data leakage~~* *deep learning to predict earthquakes, I've written up my analysis below. I'd like the community's perspective on the paper, particularly if I got anything wrong. As I wrote up my analysis, a few questions were on my mind:* * *What's the clearest way to explain to a layman that a model trained on 96 examples is unlikely to generalize well?* * *When does exaggerating the promise of AI cross the line from annoying marketing hype to being an ethical issue?* * *If general journals can't effectively review papers about machine learning applications and ML conferences aren't interested in that subject... where should those papers be published?* *Full text below.* *----* This week’s US rollout of the first COVID-19 vaccine is a major milestone, a true triumph for scientists, and a massive relief for the rest of us. But it’s also an excuse to revisit my least favorite paper published this year. That paper, “[Estimating the deep replicability of scientific findings using human and artificial intelligence](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/uzzi/htm/papers/Replicability-PNAS-2020.pdf),” was written by a team of researchers at Northwestern led by Brian Uzzi. It was published in PNAS on May 4, and its publication was accompanied by a glowing press release (“[AI speeds up search for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/05/ai-tool-speeds-up-search-for-covid-19-treatments-and-vaccines/?fj=1)”) and received credulous coverage in outlets like [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2020/05/04/artificial-intelligence-reproducibility-crisis-kellogg/) and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/northwestern-university-team-develops-tool-to-rate-covid-19-research-11589275800). One of my primary professional interests is using data analysis to systematically identify good science, so I was eager to dig into the paper. Unfortunately, I found that the paper is flawed and doesn’t support the Covid-related story that the authors and Northwestern shared with the media. My initial skepticism has proved out; vaccines are now being distributed with (as far as I can tell) no help whatsoever from this particular bit of AI. Closer analysis will show that the paper isn’t convincing, that it had nothing to do with Covid, and that the author was reckless in how he promoted it. **Problem #1: The machine learning in the academic paper is flawed** The core of the paper is a machine learning model built by the authors that predicts whether or not a paper will replicate. To be technical about it, the model is trained on a dataset of 96 social science papers, 59 of which (61.4%) failed to replicate. The model takes the full text of the paper as an input, uses word embeddings and TF-IDF to convert each text to a 400-dimensional vector, and then feeds those vectors into an ensemble logistic regression/random forest model. The cross-validated results show an average accuracy of 0.69 across runs compared to the baseline accuracy of 0.614. These are all standard techniques, but skilled machine learning practitioners are already raising their eyebrows about three points: * **The authors don’t have enough data to build a reliable model**. The authors have used just 96 examples to build a model with 400 input variables. As mentioned above, the model has two components: a logistic regressor and a random forest. A conventional rule of thumb is that logistic regression requires a minimum of 10 examples per variable, which would suggest that the authors need 40x more data. “Underdetermined” doesn’t even begin to describe the situation.The data needs of random forests are harder to characterize. While geneticists [routinely use random forests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154091/) in settings with more variables than examples, their use case is typically more focused on determining variable importance than actually making predictions. And indeed, [some research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25532820/) that random forests need more than 200 examples per variable, or almost 1000x more data than the authors have.**The bottom line is that you can’t build a reliable machine learning model on just 96 papers.** * **The model structure is too complicated**. Model structure is the garden of forking paths for machine learning. Adjustments to a model can improve its performance on available data while reducing performance on unseen data. (And no, cross-validation alone doesn’t fix this!) The model structure the authors describe is reasonable enough, but it also includes some clearly arbitrary choices like using both logistic regression and random forests (rather than just picking one) or aggregating word vectors using both simple averaging and TF-IDF (again rather than just picking one.) With just 96 examples in the dataset, each version of model that the authors tried had a real chance to show a cross-validation accuracy that looked like success despite arising from chance. In context, **trying multiple model architectures is the the equivalent of performing subgroup analyses.** * **The effect size is too small.** Increasing accuracy from the baseline of 0.614 to 0.69 is too small an effect to achieve statistical significance particularly in light of the small sample size. The large number of degrees of freedom in model design. The paper’s statistical analyses generate pleasing p-values (*p<0.001*) demonstrating that the model is effective *on this particular set of papers.* But what we’re actually interested in is whether the model outperforms the baseline on unseen data (i.e. whether it has better generalization error.) Performing [inference about generalization error](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024068626366) is a [challenging task](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790639) (and there isn’t a single agreed upon methodology). But as a sanity check, consider the t-test we would use to e.g. determine if one diagnostic test were more accurate than another when given to patients. The cynical baseline (predicting that nothing ever replicates) gives an accuracy of 0.614 on these 96 papers. The authors’ model achieves an accuracy of 0.69 on those same papers. That gives a one-tailed p-value of 0.134 — a delightful value for a paper that is itself about replicability. And this point isn't just pedantry; I'm genuinely unsure if the model will actually outperform the cynical baseline on unseen data. I don't know what the base rate for replication is in the test sets. I did track down the replication status for one set (Row 2 in the paper) and saw  7 out of the 8 results in that set failed to replicate, so our cynical baseline achieves an accuracy of 0.875 — outperforming the “AI” model significantly on this admittedly small set. Let me be very clear: These are very fundamental problems. After reviewing the paper, I’m not confident that their machine learning model adds any value at all. It reflects poorly on PNAS that this paper made it through peer review. Unfortunately, general scientific journals - no matter how prestigious - don’t seem equipped to effectively review papers involving machine learning; Nature’s infamous paper on predicting earthquakes with deep learning was [widely criticized](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/c4ylga/d_misuse_of_deep_learning_in_nature_journals/) in the machine learning community. **Problem #2: The paper has nothing to do with Covid** Let’s set aside every issue I’ve raised to this point and accept that the authors really can identify social science papers that are less likely to replicate. That still doesn’t make it relevant to Covid. Their entire system is premised on picking up subtle linguistic markers that supposedly indicate when a researcher (perhaps subconsciously) believes she’s performing sub-par science. Uzzi compares the approach to reading body language. But there’s no reason to believe that the linguistic “body language” of psychologists tells us anything about the body language of Covid-19 researchers. Psychology and virology are very different fields with different conventions even in normal times. The pandemic itself has undoubtedly impacted word choices, as papers written under extreme time pressure by researchers from around the world get shared to pre-print servers rather than being polished and published in journals. At a minimum, the model would have to be significantly adjusted to be applied to Covid research. **Problem #3: Northwestern and Brian Uzzi crossed the line promoting this paper** Self-promotion is a natural and even important part of science; good research doesn’t always get the attention is deserves. And certainly the decade-long AI boom has been driven forward by rosy projections about what AI can accomplish. But the paper’s lead author, Brian Uzzi, went too far in his efforts to promote it. The paper was published just two months into the pandemic at a time when the trauma felt more acute than chronic. The uncertainty and fear fueled a desperation for anything that might end the ordeal. In that environment, putting out a press release entitled “AI speeds up search for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines” takes on a moral dimension. The scientists and trial participants who brought us a vaccine in record time are heroes. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal coverage of this paper now has a correction appended: >Northwestern University researchers will make an artificial-intelligence tool designed to rate the promise of scientific papers on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments available when testing is completed. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the tool would be available later this year. Indeed. \--- *Originally published on* [*Substack*](https://divergentdata.substack.com/p/on-not-fighting-covid-with-ai)",Accepting a paper that revolves around training ML with 96 examples is incompetence.

khin4c,"According to [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-element-ai-sold-for-230-million-as-founders-saw-value-wiped-out/) article: **Element AI sold for $230-million as founders saw value mostly wiped out, document reveals** Montreal startup Element AI Inc. was running out of money and options when it inked a deal last month to sell itself for US$230-milion to Silicon Valley software company ServiceNow Inc., a confidential document obtained by the Globe and Mail reveals. Materials sent to Element AI shareholders Friday reveal that while many of its institutional shareholders will make most if not all of their money back from backing two venture financings, employees will not fare nearly as well. Many have been terminated and had their stock options cancelled. Also losing out are co-founders Jean-François Gagné, the CEO, his wife Anne Martel, the chief administrative officer, chief science officer Nick Chapados and **Yoshua Bengio**, the University of Montreal professor known as a godfather of “deep learning,” the foundational science behind today’s AI revolution. Between them, they owned 8.8 million common shares, whose value has been wiped out with the takeover, which goes to a shareholder vote Dec 29 with enough investor support already locked up to pass before the takeover goes to a Canadian court to approve a plan of arrangement with ServiceNow. The quartet also owns preferred shares worth less than US$300,000 combined under the terms of the deal. The shareholder document, a management proxy circular, provides a rare look inside efforts by a highly hyped but deeply troubled startup as it struggled to secure financing at the same time as it was failing to live up to its early promises. The circular states the US$230-million purchase price is subject to some adjustments and expenses which could bring the final price down to US$195-million. The sale is a disappointing outcome for a company that burst onto the Canadian tech scene four years ago like few others, promising to deliver AI-powered operational improvements to a range of industries and anchor a thriving domestic AI sector. Element AI became the self-appointed representative of Canada’s AI sector, lobbying politicians and officials and landing numerous photo ops with them, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It also secured $25-million in federal funding – $20-million of which was committed earlier this year and cancelled by the government with the ServiceNow takeover. Element AI invested heavily in hype and and earned international renown, largely due to its association with Dr. Bengio. It raised US$102-million in venture capital in 2017 just nine months after its founding, an unheard of amount for a new Canadian company, from international backers including Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp., Tencent Holdings Ltd., Fidelity Investments, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund and venture capital firms. Element AI went on a hiring spree to establish what the founders called “supercredibility,” recruiting top AI talent in Canada and abroad. It opened global offices, including a British operation that did pro bono work to deliver “AI for good,” and its ranks swelled to 500 people. But the swift hiring and attention-seeking were at odds with its success in actually building a software business. Element AI took two years to focus on product development after initially pursuing consulting gigs. It came into 2019 with a plan to bring several AI-based products to market, including a cybersecurity offering for financial institutions and a program to help port operators predict waiting times for truck drivers. It was also quietly shopping itself around. In December 2018, the company asked financial adviser Allen & Co LLC to find a potential buyer, in addition to pursuing a private placement, the circular reveals. But Element AI struggled to advance proofs-of-concept work to marketable products. Several client partnerships faltered in 2019 and 2020. Element did manage to reach terms for a US$151.4-million ($200-million) venture financing in September, 2019 led by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and backed by the Quebec government and consulting giant McKinsey and Co. However, the circular reveals the company only received the first tranche of the financing – roughly half of the amount – at the time, and that it had to meet unspecified conditions to get the rest. A fairness opinion by Deloitte commissioned as part of the sale process estimated Element AI’s enterprises value at just US$76-million around the time of the 2019 financing, shrinking to US$45-million this year. “However, the conditions precedent the closing of the second tranche … were not going to be met in a timely manner,” the circular reads. It states “new terms were proposed” for a round of financing that would give incoming investors ranking ahead of others and a cumulative dividend of 12 per cent on invested capital and impose “other operating and governance constraints and limitations on the company.” Management instead decided to pursue a sale, and Allen contacted prospective buyers in June. As talks narrowed this past summer to exclusive negotiations with ServiceNow, “the company’s liquidity was diminishing as sources of capital on acceptable terms were scarce,” the circular reads. By late November, it was generating revenue at an annualized rate of just $10-million to $12-million, Deloitte said. As part of the deal – which will see ServiceNow keep Element AI’s research scientists and patents and effectively abandon its business – the buyer has agreed to pay US$10-million to key employees and consultants including Mr. Gagne and Dr. Bengio as part of a retention plan. The Caisse and Quebec government will get US$35.45-million and US$11.8-million, respectively, roughly the amount they invested in the first tranche of the 2019 financing.","This actually bothers me so much. These guys were given all the resources in the world with insane early financing, a top-tier talent pool right next door (MILA) and one of the most venture-supportive governments in the world. A chance for Quebec to become a leader in industrial AI, and instead, we’re a joke.",233

kqazpd,"**TL;DR:** GNNs can provide wins over simpler embedding methods, but we're at a point where other research directions matter more I also posted it on my [blog here](https://www.singlelunch.com/2020/12/28/why-im-lukewarm-on-graph-neural-networks/), has footnotes, a nicer layout with inlined images, etc. ----------- I'm only lukewarm on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). There, I said it. It might sound crazy GNNs are one of the hottest fields in machine learning right now. [There][1] were at least [four][2] [review][3] [papers][4] just in the last few months. I think some progress can come of this research, but we're also focusing on some incorrect places. But first, let's take a step back and go over the basics. # Models are about compression We say graphs are a ""non-euclidean"" data type, but that's not really true. A regular graph is just another way to think about a particular flavor of square matrix called the [adjacency matrix][5], like [this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdjacencyMatrices_1002.gif). It's weird, we look at run-of-the-mill matrix full of real numbers and decide to call it ""non-euclidean"". This is for practical reasons. Most graphs are fairly sparse, so the matrix is full of zeros. At this point, *where the non-zero numbers are* matters most, which makes the problem closer to (computationally hard) discrete math rather than (easy) continuous, gradient-friendly math. **If you had the full matrix, life would be easy** If we step out of the pesky realm of physics for a minute, and assume carrying the full adjacency matrix around isn't a problem, we solve a bunch of problems. First, network node embeddings aren't a thing anymore. A node is a just row in the matrix, so it's already a vector of numbers. Second, all network prediction problems are solved. A powerful enough and well-tuned model will simply extract all information between the network and whichever target variable we're attaching to nodes. **NLP is also just fancy matrix compression** Let's take a tangent away from graphs to NLP. Most NLP we do can be [thought of in terms of graphs][6] as we'll see, so it's not a big digression. First, note that Ye Olde word embedding models like [Word2Vec][7] and [GloVe][8] are [just matrix factorization][9]. The GloVe algorithm works on a variation of the old [bag of words][10] matrix. It goes through the sentences and creates a (implicit) [co-occurence][11] graph where nodes are words and the edges are weighed by how often the words appear together in a sentence. Glove then does matrix factorization on the matrix representation of that co-occurence graph, Word2Vec is mathematically equivalent. You can read more on this in my [post on embeddings][12] and the one (with code) on [word embeddings][13]. **Even language models are also just matrix compression** Language models are all the rage. They dominate most of the [state of the art][14] in NLP. Let's take BERT as our main example. BERT predicts a word given the context of the [rest of the sentence](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png). This grows the matrix we're factoring from flat co-occurences on pairs of words to co-occurences conditional on the sentence's context, like [this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png) We're growing the ""ideal matrix"" we're factoring combinatorially. As noted by [Hanh & Futrell][15]: > [...] human language—and language modelling—has infinite statistical complexity but that it can be approximated well at lower levels. This observation has two implications: 1) We can obtain good results with comparatively small models; and 2) there is a lot of potential for scaling up our models. Language models tackle such a large problem space that they probably approximate a compression of the entire language in the [Kolmogorov Complexity][16] sense. It's also possible that huge language models just [memorize a lot of it][17] rather than compress the information, for what it's worth. ### Can we upsample any graph like language models do? We're already doing it. Let's call a **first-order** embedding of a graph a method that works by directly factoring the graph's adjacency matrix or [Laplacian matrix][18]. If you embed a graph using [Laplacian Eigenmaps][19] or by taking the [principal components][20] of the Laplacian, that's first order. Similarly, GloVe is a first-order method on the graph of word co-occurences. One of my favorites first order methods for graphs is [ProNE][21], which works as well as most methods while being two orders of magnitude faster. A **higher-order** method embeds the original matrix plus connections of neighbours-of-neighbours (2nd degree) and deeper k-step connections. [GraRep][22], shows you can always generate higher-order representations from first order methods by augmenting the graph matrix. Higher order method are the ""upsampling"" we do on graphs. GNNs that sample on large neighborhoods and random-walk based methods like node2vec are doing higher-order embeddings. # Where are the performance gain? Most GNN papers in the last 5 years present empirical numbers that are useless for practitioners to decide on what to use. As noted in the [OpenGraphsBenchmark][4] (OGB) paper, GNN papers do their empirical section on a handful of tiny graphs (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) with 2000-20,000 nodes. These datasets can't seriously differentiate between methods. Recent efforts are directly fixing this, but the reasons why researchers focused on tiny, useless datasets for so long are worth discussing. **Performance matters by task** One fact that surprises a lot of people is that even though language models have the best performance in a lot of NLP tasks, if all you're doing is cram sentence embeddings into a downstream model, there [isn't much gained][23] from language models embeddings over simple methods like summing the individual Word2Vec word embeddings (This makes sense, because the full context of the sentence is captured in the sentence co-occurence matrix that is generating the Word2Vec embeddings). Similarly, [I find][24] that for many graphs **simple first-order methods perform just as well on graph clustering and node label prediction tasks than higher-order embedding methods**. In fact higher-order methods are massively computationally wasteful for these usecases. Recommended first order embedding methods are ProNE and my [GGVec with order=1][25]. Higher order methods normally perform better on the link prediction tasks. I'm not the only one to find this. In the BioNEV paper, they find: ""A large GraRep order value for link prediction tasks (e.g. 3, 4);a small value for node classification tasks (e.g.1, 2)"" (p.9). Interestingly, the gap in link prediction performance is inexistant for artificially created graphs. This suggests higher order methods do learn some of the structure intrinsic to [real world graphs][26]. For visualization, first order methods are better. Visualizations of higher order methods tend to have artifacts of their sampling. For instance, Node2Vec visualizations tend to have elongated/filament-like structures which come from the embeddings coming from long single strand random walks. See the following visualizations by [Owen Cornec][27] created by first embedding the graph to 32-300 dimensions using a node embedding algorithm, then mapping this to 2d or 3d with the excellent UMAP algorithm, like [this](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png) Lastly, sometimes simple methods soundly beat higher order methods (there's an instance of it in the OGB paper). The problem here is that **we don't know when any method is better than another** and **we definitely don't know the reason**. There's definitely a reason different graph types respond better/worse to being represented by various methods. This is currently an open question. A big part of why is that the research space is inundated under useless new algorithms because... # Academic incentives work against progress Here's the cynic's view of how machine learning papers are made: 1.  Take an existing algorithm 2.  Add some new layer/hyperparameter, make a cute mathematical story for why it matters 3.  Gridsearch your hyperparameters until you beat baselines from the original paper you aped 4.  Absolutely don't gridsearch stuff you're comparing against in your results section 5.  Make a cute ACRONYM for your new method, put impossible to use python 2 code on github (Or no code at all!) and bask in the citations I'm [not][28] the [only one][29] with these views on the state reproducible research. At least it's gotten slightly better in the last 2 years. ### Sidebar: I hate Node2Vec A side project of mine is a [node embedding library][25] and the most popular method in it is by far Node2Vec. Don't use Node2Vec. [Node2Vec][30] with `p=1; q=1` is the [Deepwalk][31] algorithm. Deepwalk is an actual innovation. The Node2Vec authors closely followed the steps 1-5 including bonus points on step 5 by getting word2vec name recognition. This is not academic fraud -- the hyperparameters [do help a tiny bit][32] if you gridsearch really hard. But it's the presentable-to-your-parents sister of where you make the ML community worse off to progress your academic career. And certainly Node2Vec doesn't deserve 7500 citations. # Progress is all about practical issues We've known how to train neural networks for well over 40 years. Yet they only exploded in popularity with [AlexNet][33] in 2012. This is because implementations and hardware came to a point where deep learning was **practical**. Similarly, we've known about factoring word co-occurence matrices into Word embeddings for at least 20 years. But word embeddings only exploded in 2013 with Word2Vec. The breakthrough here was that the minibatch-based methods let you train a Wikipedia-scale embedding model on commodity hardware. It's hard for methods in a field to make progress if training on a small amount of data takes days or weeks. You're disincentivized to explore new methods. If you want progress, your stuff has to run in reasonable time on commodity hardware. Even Google's original search algorithm [initially ran on commodity hardware][34]. **Efficiency is paramount to progress** The reason deep learning research took off the way it did is because of improvements in [efficiency][35] as well as much better libraries and hardware support. **Academic code is terrible** Any amount of time you spend gridsearching Node2Vec on `p` and `q` is all put to better use gridsearching Deepwalk itself (on number of walks, length of walks, or word2vec hyperparameters). The problem is that people don't gridsearch over deepwalk because implementations are all terrible. I wrote the [Nodevectors library][36] to have a fast deepwalk implementation because it took **32 hours** to embed a graph with a measly 150,000 nodes using the reference Node2Vec implementation (the same takes 3min with Nodevectors). It's no wonder people don't gridsearch on Deepwalk a gridsearch would take weeks with the terrible reference implementations. To give an example, in the original paper of [GraphSAGE][37] they their algorithm to DeepWalk with walk lengths of 5, which is horrid if you've ever hyperparameter tuned a deepwalk algorithm. From their paper: > We did observe DeepWalk’s performance could improve with further training, and in some cases it could become competitive with the unsupervised GraphSAGE approaches (but not the supervised approaches) if we let it run for >1000× longer than the other approaches (in terms of wall clock time for prediction on the test set) I don't even think the GraphSAGE authors had bad intent -- deepwalk implementations are simply so awful that they're turned away from using it properly. It's like trying to do deep learning with 2002 deep learning libraries and hardware. # Your architectures don't really matter One of the more important papers this year was [OpenAI's ""Scaling laws""][38] paper, where the raw number of parameters in your model is the most predictive feature of overall performance. This was noted even in the original BERT paper and drives 2020's increase in absolutely massive language models. This is really just [Sutton' Bitter Lesson][39] in action: > General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin Transformers might be [replacing convolution][40], too. As [Yannic Kilcher said][41], transformers are ruining everything. [They work on graphs][6], in fact it's one of the [recent approaches][42], and seems to be one of the more succesful [when benchmarked][1] Researchers seem to be putting so much effort into architecture, but it doesn't matter much in the end because you can approximate anything by stacking more layers. Efficiency wins are great -- but neural net architectures are just one way to achieve that, and by tremendously over-researching this area we're leaving a lot of huge gains elsewhere on the table. # Current Graph Data Structure Implementations suck NetworkX is a bad library. I mean, it's good if you're working on tiny graphs for babies, but for anything serious it chokes and forces you to rewrite everything in... what library, really? At this point most people working on large graphs end up hand-rolling some data structure. This is tough because your computer's memory is a 1-dimensional array of 1's and 0's and a graph has no obvious 1-d mapping. This is even harder when we take updating the graph (adding/removing some nodes/edges) into account. Here's a few options: ### Disconnected networks of pointers NetworkX is the best example. Here, every node is an object with a list of pointers to other nodes (the node's edges). This layout is like a linked list. Linked lists are the [root of all performance evil][43]. Linked lists go completely against how modern computers are designed. Fetching things from memory is slow, and operating on memory is fast (by two orders of magnitude). Whenever you do anything in this layout, you make a roundtrip to RAM. It's slow by design, you can write this in Ruby or C or assembly and it'll be slow regardless, because memory fetches are slow in hardware. The main advantage of this layout is that adding a new node is O(1). So if you're maintaining a massive graph where adding and removing nodes happens as often as reading from the graph, it makes sense. Another advantage of this layout is that it ""scales"". Because everything is decoupled from each other you can put this data structure on a cluster. However, you're really creating a complex solution for a problem you created for yourself. ### Sparse Adjacency Matrix This layout great for read-only graphs. I use it as the backend in my [nodevectors][25] library, and many other library writers use the [Scipy CSR Matrix][44], you can see graph algorithms implemented on it [here][45]. The most popular layout for this use is the [CSR Format][46] where you have 3 arrays holding the graph. One for edge destinations, one for edge weights and an ""index pointer"" which says which edges come from which node. Because the CSR layout is simply 3 arrays, it scales on a single computer: a CSR matrix can be laid out on a disk instead of in-memory. You simply [memory map][47] the 3 arrays and use them on-disk from there. With modern NVMe drives random seeks aren't slow anymore, much faster than distributed network calls like you do when scaling the linked list-based graph. I haven't seen anyone actually implement this yet, but it's in the roadmap for my implementation at least. The problem with this representation is that adding a node or edge means rebuilding the whole data structure. ### Edgelist representations This representation is three arrays: one for the edge sources, one for the edge destinations, and one for edge weights. [DGL][48] uses this representation internally. This is a simple and compact layout which can be good for analysis. The problem compared to CSR Graphs is some seek operations are slower. Say you want all the edges for node #4243. You can't jump there without maintaining an index pointer array. So either you maintain sorted order and binary search your way there (O(log2n)) or unsorted order and linear search (O(n)). This data structure can also work on memory mapped disk array, and node append is fast on unsorted versions (it's slow in the sorted version). # Global methods are a dead end Methods that work on the **entire graph at once** can't leverage computation, because they run out of RAM at a certain scale. So any method that want a chance of being the new standard need to be able to update piecemeal on parts of the graph. **Sampling-based methods** Sampling Efficiency will matter more in the future *   **Edgewise local methods**. The only algorithms I know of that do this are GloVe and GGVec, which they pass through an edge list and update embedding weights on each step.  The problem with this approach is that it's hard to use them for higher-order methods. The advantage is that they easily scale even on one computer. Also, incrementally adding a new node is as simple as taking the existing embeddings, adding a new one, and doing another epoch over the data *   **Random Walk sampling**. This is used by deepwalk and its descendants, usually for node embeddings rather than GNN methods. This can be computationally expensive and make it hard to add new nodes. But this does scale, for instance [Instagram][49] use it to feed their recommendation system models *   **Neighbourhood sampling**. This is currently the most common one in GNNs, and can be low or higher order depending on the neighborhood size. It also scales well, though implementing efficiently can be challenging. It's currently used by [Pinterest][50]'s recommendation algorithms. # Conclusion Here are a few interesting questions: *   What is the relation between graph types and methods? *   Consolidated benchmarking like OGB *   We're throwing random models at random benchmarks without understanding why or when they do better *   More fundamental research. Heree's one I'm curious about: can other representation types like [Poincarre Embeddings][51] effectively encode directed relationships? On the other hand, we should **stop focusing on** adding spicy new layers to test on the same tiny datasets. No one cares.

kvs1ex,"[I've been collecting methods to accelerate training in PyTorch](https://efficientdl.com/faster-deep-learning-in-pytorch-a-guide/) – here's what I've found so far. What did I miss? What did I get wrong? The methods – roughly sorted from largest to smallest expected speed-up – are: 1. Consider using a different learning rate schedule. 2. Use multiple workers and pinned memory in DataLoader. 3. Max out the batch size. 4. Use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). 5. Consider using a different optimizer. 6. Turn on cudNN benchmarking. 7. Beware of frequently transferring data between CPUs and GPUs. 8. Use gradient/activation checkpointing. 9. Use gradient accumulation. 10. Use DistributedDataParallel for multi-GPU training. 11. Set gradients to None rather than 0. 12. Use .as\_tensor rather than .tensor() 13. Turn off debugging APIs if not needed. 14. Use gradient clipping. 15. Turn off bias before BatchNorm. 16. Turn off gradient computation during validation. 17. Use input and batch normalization. ## 1. Consider using another learning rate schedule The learning rate (schedule) you choose has a large impact on the speed of convergence as well as the generalization performance of your model. Cyclical Learning Rates and the 1Cycle learning rate schedule are both methods introduced by Leslie N. Smith ([here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120)), and then popularised by fast.ai's Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger ([here](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/) and [here](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Cyclical%20LR%20and%20momentums.ipynb)). Essentially, the 1Cycle learning rate schedule looks something like this: &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/sc37u5knmxa61.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=09b309b4dbd67eedb4ab5f86e03e0e83d7b072d1 Sylvain writes: >\[1cycle consists of\]  two steps of equal lengths, one going from a lower learning rate to a higher one than go back to the minimum. The maximum should be the value picked with the Learning Rate Finder, and the lower one can be ten times lower. Then, the length of this cycle should be slightly less than the total number of epochs, and, in the last part of training, we should allow the learning rate to decrease more than the minimum, by several orders of magnitude. In the best case this schedule achieves a massive speed-up – what Smith calls *Superconvergence* – as compared to conventional learning rate schedules. Using the 1Cycle policy he needs \~10x fewer training iterations of a ResNet-56 on ImageNet to match the performance of the original paper, for instance). The schedule seems to perform robustly well across common architectures and optimizers. PyTorch implements both of these methods `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CyclicLR` and `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR,` see [the documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html). One drawback of these schedulers is that they introduce a number of additional hyperparameters. [This post](https://towardsdatascience.com/hyper-parameter-tuning-techniques-in-deep-learning-4dad592c63c8) and [this repo](https://github.com/davidtvs/pytorch-lr-finder), offer a nice overview and implementation of how good hyper-parameters can be found including the Learning Rate Finder mentioned above. Why does this work? It doesn't seem entirely clear but one[ possible explanation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) might be that regularly increasing the learning rate helps to traverse [saddle points in the loss landscape ](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/430c3626b879b4005d41b8a46172e0c0-Paper.pdf)more quickly. ## 2. Use multiple workers and pinned memory in DataLoader When using [torch.utils.data.DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader), set `num_workers > 0`, rather than the default value of 0, and `pin_memory=True`, rather than the default value of False. Details of this are [explained here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html). [Szymon Micacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) achieves a 2x speed-up for a single training epoch by using four workers and pinned memory. A rule of thumb that [people are using ](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/guidelines-for-assigning-num-workers-to-dataloader/813/5)to choose the number of workers is to set it to four times the number of available GPUs with both a larger and smaller number of workers leading to a slow down. Note that increasing num\_workerswill increase your CPU memory consumption. ## 3. Max out the batch size This is a somewhat contentious point. Generally, however, it seems like using the largest batch size your GPU memory permits will accelerate your training (see [NVIDIA's Szymon Migacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf), for instance). Note that you will also have to adjust other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, if you modify the batch size. A rule of thumb here is to double the learning rate as you double the batch size. [OpenAI has a nice empirical paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06162.pdf) on the number of convergence steps needed for different batch sizes. [Daniel Huynh](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-a-batch-size-finder-in-fastai-how-to-get-a-4x-speedup-with-better-generalization-813d686f6bdf) runs some experiments with different batch sizes (also using the 1Cycle policy discussed above) where he achieves a 4x speed-up by going from batch size 64 to 512. [One of the downsides](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04836.pdf) of using large batch sizes, however, is that they might lead to solutions that generalize worse than those trained with smaller batches. ## 4. Use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) The release of PyTorch 1.6 included a native implementation of Automatic Mixed Precision training to PyTorch. The main idea here is that certain operations can be run faster and without a loss of accuracy at semi-precision (FP16) rather than in the single-precision (FP32) used elsewhere. AMP, then, automatically decide which operation should be executed in which format. This allows both for faster training and a smaller memory footprint. In the best case, the usage of AMP would look something like this:     import torch     # Creates once at the beginning of training     scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()          for data, label in data_iter:        optimizer.zero_grad()        # Casts operations to mixed precision        with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():           loss = model(data)             # Scales the loss, and calls backward()        # to create scaled gradients        scaler.scale(loss).backward()             # Unscales gradients and calls        # or skips optimizer.step()        scaler.step(optimizer)             # Updates the scale for next iteration        scaler.update() Benchmarking a number of common language and vision models on NVIDIA V100 GPUs, [Huang and colleagues find](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-training-on-nvidia-gpus-with-pytorch-automatic-mixed-precision/) that using AMP over regular FP32 training yields roughly 2x – but upto 5.5x – training speed-ups. Currently, only CUDA ops can be autocast in this way. See the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html#op-eligibility) here for more details on this and other limitations. u/SVPERBlA points out that you can squeeze out some additional performance (\~ 20%) from AMP on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs if you convert your tensors to the [Channels Last memory format](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/memory_format_tutorial.html). Refer to [this section](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-convolutional/index.html#tensor-layout) in the NVIDIA docs for an explanation of the speedup and more about NCHW versus NHWC tensor formats. ## 5. Consider using another optimizer AdamW is Adam with weight decay (rather than L2-regularization) which was popularized by fast.ai and is now available natively in PyTorch as `torch.optim.AdamW`. AdamW seems to consistently outperform Adam in terms of both the error achieved and the training time. See [this excellent blog](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/) post on why using weight decay instead of L2-regularization makes a difference for Adam. Both Adam and AdamW work well with the 1Cycle policy described above. There are also a few not-yet-native optimizers that have received a lot of attention recently, most notably LARS ([pip installable implementation](https://github.com/kakaobrain/torchlars)) and [LAMB](https://github.com/cybertronai/pytorch-lamb). NVIDA's APEX implements fused versions of a number of common optimizers such as [Adam](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/optimizers.html). This implementation avoid a number of passes to and from GPU memory as compared to the PyTorch implementation of Adam, yielding speed-ups in the range of 5%. ## 6. Turn on cudNN benchmarking If your model architecture remains fixed and your input size stays constant, setting `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True` might be beneficial ([docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/backends.html#torch-backends-cudnn)). This enables the cudNN autotuner which will benchmark a number of different ways of computing convolutions in cudNN and then use the fastest method from then on. For a rough reference on the type of speed-up you can expect from this, [Szymon Migacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) achieves a speed-up of 70% on a forward pass for a convolution and a 27% speed-up for a forward + backward pass of the same convolution. One caveat here is that this autotuning might become very slow if you max out the batch size as mentioned above. ## 7. Beware of frequently transferring data between CPUs and GPUs Beware of frequently transferring tensors from a GPU to a CPU using `tensor.cpu()` and vice versa using `tensor.cuda()` as these are relatively expensive. The same applies for `.item()` and `.numpy()` – use `.detach()` instead. If you are creating a new tensor, you can also directly assign it to your GPU using the keyword argument `device=torch.device('cuda:0')`. If you do need to transfer data, using `.to(non_blocking=True)`, might be useful [as long as you don't have any synchronization points](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/should-we-set-non-blocking-to-true/38234/4) after the transfer. If you really have to, you might want to give Santosh Gupta's [SpeedTorch](https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/SpeedTorch) a try, although it doesn't seem entirely clear when this actually does/doesn't provide speed-ups. ## 8. Use gradient/activation checkpointing Quoting directly from the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html): >Checkpointing works by trading compute for memory. Rather than storing all intermediate activations of the entire computation graph for computing backward, the checkpointed part does **not** save intermediate activations, and instead recomputes them in backward pass. It can be applied on any part of a model.   >   >Specifically, in the forward pass, function will run in [torch.no\_grad()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.no_grad.html#torch.no_grad) manner, i.e., not storing the intermediate activations. Instead, the forward pass saves the inputs tuple and the functionparameter. In the backwards pass, the saved inputs and function is retrieved, and the forward pass is computed on function again, now tracking the intermediate activations, and then the gradients are calculated using these activation values. So while this will might slightly increase your run time for a given batch size, you'll significantly reduce your memory footprint. This in turn will allow you to further increase the batch size you're using allowing for better GPU utilization. While checkpointing is implemented natively as `torch.utils.checkpoint`([docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html)), it does seem to take some thought and effort to implement properly. Priya Goyal [has a good tutorial ](https://github.com/prigoyal/pytorch_memonger/blob/master/tutorial/Checkpointing_for_PyTorch_models.ipynb)demonstrating some of the key aspects of checkpointing. ## 9. Use gradient accumulation Another approach to increasing the batch size is to accumulate gradients across multiple `.backward()` passes before calling optimizer.step(). Following [a post](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) by Hugging Face's Thomas Wolf, gradient accumulation can be implemented as follows:     model.zero_grad()                                   # Reset gradients tensors     for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(training_set):         predictions = model(inputs)                     # Forward pass         loss = loss_function(predictions, labels)       # Compute loss function         loss = loss / accumulation_steps                # Normalize our loss (if averaged)         loss.backward()                                 # Backward pass         if (i+1) % accumulation_steps == 0:             # Wait for several backward steps             optimizer.step()                            # Now we can do an optimizer step             model.zero_grad()                           # Reset gradients tensors             if (i+1) % evaluation_steps == 0:           # Evaluate the model when we...                 evaluate_model()                        # ...have no gradients accumulate This method was developed mainly to circumvent GPU memory limitations and I'm not entirely clear on the trade-off between having additional `.backward()` loops. [This discussion](https://forums.fast.ai/t/accumulating-gradients/33219/28) on the fastai forum seems to suggest that it can in fact accelerate training, so it's probably worth a try. ## 10. Use Distributed Data Parallel for multi-GPU training Methods to accelerate distributed training probably warrant their own post but one simple one is to use `torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel` rather than `torch.nn.DataParallel`. By doing so, each GPU will be driven by a dedicated CPU core avoiding the GIL issues of DataParallel. In general, I can strongly recommend reading the [documentation on distributed training.](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html) ## 11. Set gradients to None rather than 0 Use `.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)` rather than `.zero_grad()`. Doing so will let the memory allocator handle the gradients rather than actively setting them to 0. This will lead to yield a *modest* speed-up as they say in the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html), so don't expect any miracles. Watch out, doing this is not side-effect free! Check the docs for the details on this. ## 12. Use .as_tensor() rather than .tensor() `torch.tensor()` always copies data. If you have a numpy array that you want to convert, use `torch.as_tensor()` or `torch.from_numpy()` to avoid copying the data. ## 13. Turn on debugging tools only when actually needed PyTorch offers a number of useful debugging tools like the [autograd.profiler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#profiler), [autograd.grad\_check](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#numerical-gradient-checking), and [autograd.anomaly\_detection](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#anomaly-detection). Make sure to use them to better understand when needed but to also turn them off when you don't need them as they will slow down your training. ## 14. Use gradient clipping Originally used to avoid exploding gradients in RNNs, there is both some [empirical evidence as well as some theoretical support](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgnXpVYwS) that clipping gradients (roughly speaking: `gradient = min(gradient, threshold)`) accelerates convergence. Hugging Face's [Transformer implementation](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/7729ef738161a0a182b172fcb7c351f6d2b9c50d/examples/run_squad.py#L156) is a really clean example of how to use gradient clipping as well as some of the other methods such as AMP mentioned in this post. In PyTorch this can be done using `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_`([documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html#torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_)). It's not entirely clear to me which models benefit how much from gradient clipping but it seems to be robustly useful for RNNs, Transformer-based and ResNets architectures and a range of different optimizers. ## 15. Turn off bias before BatchNorm This is a very simple one: turn off the bias of layers before BatchNormalization layers. For a 2-D convolutional layer, this can be done by setting the bias keyword to False: `torch.nn.Conv2d(..., bias=False, ...)`.  (Here's a r[eminder why this makes sense](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46256747/can-not-use-both-bias-and-batch-normalization-in-convolution-layers).) You will save some parameters, I would however expect the speed-up of this to be relatively small as compared to some of the other methods mentioned here. ## 16. Turn off gradient computation during validation This one is straightforward: set `torch.no_grad()` during validation. ## 17. Use input and batch normalization You're probably already doing this but you might want to double-check: * Are you [normalizing](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html) your input? * Are you using [batch-normalization](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html)? And [here's](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/437840/in-machine-learning-how-does-normalization-help-in-convergence-of-gradient-desc) a reminder of why you probably should. ### Bonus tip from the comments: Use JIT to fuse point-wise operations. If you have adjacent point-wise operations you can use [PyTorch JIT](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#creating-torchscript-code) to combine them into one FusionGroup which can then be launched on a single kernel rather than multiple kernels as would have been done per default. You'll also save some memory reads and writes. [Szymon Migacz shows](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) how you can use the `@torch.jit.script` decorator to fuse the operations in a GELU, for instance:     @torch.jit.script     def fused_gelu(x):         return x * 0.5 * (1.0 + torch.erf(x / 1.41421)) In this case, fusing the operations leads to a 5x speed-up for the execution of `fused_gelu`   as compared to the unfused version. See also [this post](https://pytorch.org/blog/optimizing-cuda-rnn-with-torchscript/) for an example of how Torchscript can be used to accelerate an RNN. Hat tip to u/Patient_Atmosphere45 for the suggestion. ## Sources and additional resources Many of the tips listed above come from Szymon Migacz' [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mS1fIYj1So) and post in the [PyTorch docs](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tuning_guide.html).

I feel most of my collaborators (including my advisors) are mostly running after papers and don't seem to have interest in doing interesting off-the-track things. Ultimately, research has just become chasing one deadline after another. Another thing that bugs me is that most of the research (including mine) is not very useful. Even if I get some citations, I feel that it is highly unlikely that the work I am doing will ever be used by the general public.

Click [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NCceX2mbiKOSlAd_o7IU7nA9UskKN5WR?usp=sharing). 3. Sign into your Google account if you're not already signed in. Click the ""S"" button in the upper right to do this. Note: Being signed into a Google account has privacy ramifications, such as your Google search history being recorded in your Google account. 4.

The first output image in the Train cell (using the notebook's default of seeing every 100th image generated) usually is a very poor match to the desired text, but the second output image often is a decent match to the desired text. To change the default of seeing every 100th image generated, change the number 100 in line ""if itt % 100 == 0:"" in the Train cell to the desired number. Tips for the text descriptions that you supply: 1. In Section 3.1.4 of OpenAI's [CLIP paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf) (pdf), the authors recommend using a text description of the form ""A photo of a {label}."" or ""A photo of a {label}, a type of {type}."" for images that are photographs. 2. A Reddit user gives [these tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaSynthesis/comments/l2hmqn/this_aint_it_chief/gk8g8e9/). 3. The Big Sleep should generate [these 1,000 types of things](https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaSynthesis/comments/l7hbix/tip_for_users_of_the_big_sleep_it_should_on/) better on average than other types of things. [Here](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/big-sleep-ai-image-generator/) is an article containing a high-level description of how The Big Sleep works. The Big Sleep uses a modified version of [BigGAN](https://aiweirdness.com/post/182322518157/welcome-to-latent-space) as its image generator component. The Big Sleep uses the ViT-B/32 [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) model to rate how well a given image matches your desired text. The best CLIP model according to the CLIP paper authors is the (as of this writing) unreleased ViT-L/14-336px model; see Table 10 on page 40 of the [CLIP paper (pdf)](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf) for a comparison. There are [many other sites/programs/projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ldc6oc/p_list_of_sitesprogramsprojects_that_use_openais/) that use CLIP to steer image/video creation to match a text description.

l0l0oc,"Let's talk about datasets for machine learning that change over time. In real-life projects, datasets are rarely static. They grow, change, and evolve over time. But this fact is not reflected in how most datasets are maintained. Taking inspiration from software dev, where codebases are managed using Git, we can create living Git repositories for our datasets as well. This means the dataset becomes easily manageable, and sharing, collaborating, and updating downstream consumers of changes to the data can be done similar to how we manage PIP or NPM packages. I wrote a blog about such a project, showcasing how to transform a dataset into a *living-dataset,* and use it in a machine learning project.

l2q3hh,"I'm slightly new to the field of ML research (have 1 published conference paper and 2 journal papers under review), but from what I've seen so far, a vast majority of the papers in the field are just Permutations and Combinations of the same existing datasets and existing methods. When I worked with a research group on computational biology, most of the work there was something along the lines of: taking a biology dataset that had only statistical analysis done before, training a random ML/deep learning network, and publishing that as a ""novel"" contribution - low hanging fruit like that is everywhere from astronomy to healthcare. I've seen my friends trying 100s of different models on a dataset just to see if any one model or an ensemble of some of those models would beat the existing SOTA by even 0.5%. On popular datasets like the NSLKDD (an intrusion detection dataset), we have 100s of neural network models, each of which is a paper - even though all of them have more or less the same performance (some are better in accuracy, other have lower FPR, other have lesser training cost, or others are just ensembles).  Sure, there are very interesting and novel ideas coming in - but the vast majority of people just seem to be throwing random models from random fields at random datasets hoping that it's faster/better/less memory usage/anything that can be used to claim ""novelty"". Is ""research"" like this even useful?","It is low-hanging fruit. However -  &#x200B; > Is ""research"" like this even useful?  Yes, why not? Assuming the original paper was useful, these show a new, more efficient/accurate method to do the same thing. That's innovation, even if it's lazy innovation. edit: Maybe you mean valuable to the ML research world... if so, I agree with you - applying these method to different domains isn't super valuable to advancing ML research from an ""advancing the theory"" standpoint. I suppose you could make an argument that it helps us understand situations where ML approaches are/are not better than pure statistical methods. But it certainly could advance the research in the domain of the paper.",297
l6bncg,"I volunteered to help out with a machine learning group at school and was assigned to assist a PhD student. I was asked to implement some baseline knowledge graph completion models since mid Sept but I still can't figure out how to get them to work! I spent 3 months to finally get a few models on github to work properly, but only after spending countless hours hunting out the problems in the preprocessing and evaluation code.  Now, I was asked to add another layer on top of the baselines. The PhD student directed me to another github repo from a paper that implements similar things. I just plugged my existing code into the it and somehow the model went to shit again! I went through every steps but just can't figure out what's wrong. I can't do it anymore... Every week's meeting with the PhD student is just filled with dread knowing I have no progress to report again. I know I am not a bad coder when it comes to projects in other fields so what is wrong? Is this the nature of ML code? Is there something wrong with my brain? How do you guys debug? How can I keep track of which freaking tensor is using 11G of memory!! besides adding print(tensor.shape) everywhere!? --- Edit:  Thank you for all the support and suggestions! Was not expecting this at all. Few problems I identified are: * Lack of communication with the PhD student and other research members, so I have no idea how to work on a project like this properly. * Lack of theoretical understanding and familiarity with the model and pipeline set up so I had a hard time diagnosing the problem. * This is a bit whiney but ML codes published by researchers are so freaking hard to read and understand! Sometimes they left broken code in their repo; and everyone codes their preprocessing stage differently so some subtle changes can easily lead to different outcomes. Anyway, I just contacted the PhD student and came clean to him about the difficulties. Let's see what he thinks... ---","It sounds like perhaps you are lacking a little bit of structure on your problem escalation. When you work in industry you will quickly realize there is an escalation structure and this is dependent on your project and culture of the people you are working around. There can be only 2 outcomes to an agreed deadline. 1. The project is completed in time or 2. An escalation happens with time enough for the supervisor to make decisions.  Once you think of projects this way you need to create a structure of problem escalation in your projects. You need to think of each escalation step to have a max time allowance. For example, if you are stuck in a bug for more than 1 day, you need to move forward to the next of escalation point. This might be a person working at the same level as you. In this case another assistant. If the assistant and you cannot resolve the problem in 5 hours you need to go to your next escalation point. This might be perhaps already your research supervisor. One important point here is that you need to identify your escalation path and with time see what’s solving your problems while consuming the least amount of time for you and the people arround you. As you can imagine, the more you go up the latter the more expensive time becomes. Your time is much cheaper than the supervisors time and so on. Another note is the escalation allowance time is proportional to the amount floating time of the project. The less slack you have on the project the more quickly you need to escalate.  This will allow you to find the answer the fastest while consuming the least amount of time and prevent surprises.  Follow this criteria. This should relief you and improve your productivity.",190
l9d0dl,I'll be joining grad school this coming fall as an international MSCS student (AI major).  Pretty much the question. I need a solid roadmap. I'm currently a senior year CS student.  Would you stress out much on DSA or focus on ML and DL?  I try to do a leetcode a day but most of the times I do not. So I do like 3-4 leetcode/week.  I'm worried because H1B work visa as an intl student is extremely difficult to be sponsored.,"In my experience, FAANG is pretty good at telling you what they expect. For the resume, I tend to follow this [Google Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYUy1yvjHxE). Amazon will ask you to prepare for their [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/principles) and prepare stories to elaborate on these. They all recommend answering questions with the [STAR method](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique). Obviously, there are several stages. The telephone interview is usually topical and you'll want strong ML foundations and in my experience, they'll ask all over the place and appreciate the knowledge of some shallow algorithms in addition to strong neural network knowledge. But they'll definitely want you to talk about a recent project you worked on or a recent paper you read and expect you to discuss it in depth. As for the interview itself, you'll want a strong basis in DSA and problem-solving skills. But I have not been asked to balance a binary search tree. One of the interviewers asked me if I know about big O notation and I flat out answered ""yes but no, I know the concept, but I don't know the complexity of dicts, I just know they're very fast during look-up"" and that was ok. (With a CS major the expectations may be different.) Especially during interview day, it will simply be everything. Try to cover your bases. I freaked out and focused on DSA to be better during the coding sections (whiteboarding and live coding both happened), but like an idiot did not review basic math. So for me, basic matrix multiplication cost me a job at FAANG, bit ironic. And yes as with everything they know you won't need any of this on the actual job, but you gotta do the interview.  The more research-focused positions may go less into code and more into ML theory, so it's important to see the direction to prep.",301

lej57x,"I guess this is kind of a rant about PhD admissions, specifically in ML and theoretical CS. <rant>    I recently applied to several top PhD programs, and so far I've been rejected from Berkeley, University of Washington, Columbia, Stanford, and MIT. I am expecting that I'll be rejected from the remaining programs soon. I didn't even get an interview chance, I was just rejected without speaking to anyone. I'll start with my profile (which I am willing to verify on a zoom call if any mod requests it). I grew up in a poor city in a third world country, to a very poor family. I managed to work hard during high school, ranking 3rd in my country in national exams, and got accepted on a full ride scholarship to a Hong Kong university. I have a GPA of 3.9+. I have a first author NeurIPS paper that was completed without any faculty advisors (Me and another undergraduate wrote the paper independently and it got accepted). I also have a paper in an A\* information theory conference where we settled an open problem that has been open for 8 years. I have two submissions in TCS and IEEE Transactions on information theory (both A\* journals), and one has already received a minor revision (on its way to be accepted). During my undergrad, my mother got breast cancer, and I had to work two part time jobs just to help with paying for the medical bills, while keeping up with my studies and my research. I remember I slept an average of 5 hours per day in the months of treatment. I have seen two of my LORs, both professors mentioned that I am the best undergraduate who has worked with them in their lifetime as Professors. I feel tired, mentally exhausted, and crushed. I've worked so hard over the last 8 years, just to have all my dreams destroyed. It doesn't help when everyone around me keeps saying I am ""a shoo-in for Stanford"". I just feel like I've been fighting an uphill fight all my life with no guidance, constantly having to work harder just to prove myself, and in the end, it still didn't work.

lk8ad0,"EDIT: Some people suggested that the original name seemed antagonistic towards authors and I agree. So the new name is now **PapersWithoutCode**. (Credit to /u/deep_ai for suggesting the name)    Submission link: [www.paperswithoutcode.com](https://www.paperswithoutcode.com)   Results: [papers.paperswithoutcode.com](https://papers.paperswithoutcode.com)   Context: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/lk03ef/d\_list\_of\_unreproducible\_papers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/lk03ef/d_list_of_unreproducible_papers/) I posted about not being able to reproduce a paper today and apparently it struck a chord with a lot of people who have faced the issue. I'm not sure if this is the best or worst idea ever but I figured it would be useful to collect a list of papers which people have tried to reproduce and failed. This will give the authors a chance to either release their code, provide pointers or rescind the paper. My hope is that this incentivizes a healthier ML research culture around not publishing unreproducible work. I realize that this system can be abused so in order to ensure that the reputation of the authors is not unnecessarily tarnished, the authors will be given a week to respond and their response will be reflected in the spreadsheet. It would be great if this can morph into a post-acceptance OpenReview kind of thing where the authors can have a dialogue with people trying to build off their work. This is ultimately an experiment so I'm open to constructive feedback that best serves our community.    &#x200B;","While I am all for open source culture in the sciences and I think that publishing well-documented code with examples is a great thing to do: I think this is an incredibly toxic idea (""burned papers"" - really?!) that should not be left to some anonymous internet crowd to judge but rather be handled by panels where qualified people interact in a civilized manner and take holistic views into account. For me this setup appears to be quite irresponsible. And this gracious ""one week respond period"" does not really make sense to compensate for that tbh. Ever heard of parental leave? Holidays? People being away for a while because of being sick, taking care of someone else or whatever human reason? Such thing cannot be judged by such a simple online protocol. Overall I think the harm of such public pillory by far outweighs its merits and thus should not become a standard! TL/DR: I would prefer inviting everyone to a positive culture of open source science rather than creating a toxic environment which is adversarial to the actual goal: creating as much synergy from sharing code and ideas as possible to accelerate research as a whole. ML is already toxic and exclusive enough - no reason to push that even further! \--- Some more detailed thoughts on that: There are many reasons why people would not share their code / overall setup on github. And there is really not too much need for it in many cases e.g. where contributions are mostly on a theoretical/conceptual level. ( BTW: It is a shame already that the reviewing process of most conferences require you to add bogus experiments to an otherwise theoretically sound paper as it wouldn't be considered to be a good contribution otherwise. Such a website will only add to that \[by design inherently unscientific\] development. ) I have been in the situation a lot of times where code was not available, a section of the paper was written unclear and the authors did not respond swiftly. It is annoying, yes. But honesty: it was by far the minority of cases! And in all of these cases those papers were not the high impact papers that have been crucial on a conceptual level. Sure - anecdotal evidence - but in principle I see the overall pattern that quality research correlates with open source culture. Instead of shaming those who do not publish code within a week of request, I would instead love to see an open invitation to everyone contributing to a blooming open source community. A situation I observed quite often was junior authors being afraid to put their messy code bases online for everyone to see and judge. Having a more positive community that helps with code review / restructuring, encouragement how to improve your work / presentation etc. would take a lot of such anxiety. Being afraid to be judged for inferior code quality / documentation / ""reproducibility"" by some anonymous online crowd is detrimental to that development. Furthermore, there is already a tendency to just dump the latest messy commit from right before the deadline as the ""official version"". Those are rarely truly helpful to use those concepts in downstream projects... Creating a negative incentive for not sharing code is possibly only adding to that. If you also add a negative incentive for not sharing \*well-documented\* and \*ready-to-use-for-any-layman\* repositories as some excellent researchers provide them, you add an unreasonable burden to a majority of researchers which would take too much time away from the stuff that actually matters: doing the research. The overhead from self-publishing etc. is already quite big. The value of ten similar production-ready normalizing flow libraries to just illustrate a marginal contribution is slim. By having a positive culture you could instead encourage people to e.g. merge libraries and possibly hand it over to better non-research coders to implement the production-ready code chunks. As it is actually done now in many cases (and growing)... Finally, there is a bunch of stuff that you cannot simply expect to be put online for every anonymous reddit dude to import via \`git clone\` and expect it to run on your laptop. Those can be legal reasons (IP, privacy of underlying data, governmental data) or simply architectural questions (e.g. if some tech company requires an enterprise architecture to run a large model, there are good reasons for them to not disclose parts of their business model). Usually, it should be part of the reviewing process to assess those undisclosed parts and judge the scientific validity. And it should be part of the reviewing process as well to judge whether non-disclosure of code / data affects the scientific assessment - e.g. to judge whether something published later is ""novel"" or whether an experiment is ""fair"". If there is no way to compare to the literature I think it is OK for reviewers / authors to ignore that particular paper in their experimental section and put a disclaimer about it. Long comment that probably gets downvoted anyways. But I was a bit shocked by the shallowness of the discussion regarding ethical considerations of such a public service... Let's not add to the toxicity that is already there. How about looking positively at the current development that a lot of good research is already published and that open-source in research is a growing paradigm?",210

lpo2ih,"Hi all, Recently I gave an invited talk at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory (my MA/PhD alma mater) on **Theoretical Foundations of Graph Neural Networks**. The recording is now live (+ slides in the description!): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF53xsT7mjc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF53xsT7mjc) Here I have made efforts to derive GNNs from first principles, motivate their use across the sciences, and explain how they emerged, in parallel, along several research lines. This represents a 'convergence' of the \~4 years I've spent studying GNNs: I taught them in many ways over the years, and I feel like I have finally found, imho, the most 'natural' way to introduce them. *(For the amazing insights in this direction, I need to give a shout-out to my ongoing collaborators: Joan Bruna, Michael Bronstein and Taco Cohen!)* The live Zoom session attracted \~500 people, and I received many emails afterwards in support of the talk -- hence I believe it could be both of use to beginners in the area, and offer a new perspective to seasoned GNN practitioners.  Please let me know if you found it useful, and of **any** and all feedback! :)",Very cool. I will check it out. Recently I asked a related question so I hope you can help me. Can you give me some pointers to other groups building mathematical frameworks to describe NN? I'm trying to do some sort of survey of all the approaches being used to construct mathematical frameworks to describe NN (of all kinds). EDIT: btw do you have a paper out? and where I can track progress of similar work by you and your colleagues,22
lqh9br,"I miss the ""old"" days where the title of a paper actually tells you something about the main result of the paper. For instance, the main results of the paper *""Language Models are Few-Shot Learners""* is that *Language Models are Few-Shot Learners* (given a big enough model and amount of training data). Instead, we have a million paper titled ***X Is All You Need*** that show some marginal effects when applying X.  Another frequent pattern of mediocre paper titles is to describe the method instead of the results. For instance, *Reinforcement Learning with Bayesian Kernel Latent Meanfield Priors* (made up title). Such titles are already better than the X Is All You Need crap, but describes what the authors are doing instead of what the authors showed/observed. For example, I prefer *Bayesian Kernel Latent Meanfield Priors Improve Learning in Hard-to-explore Reinforcement Learning Environments.* What are you thoughts on the recent trend of ML paper titles?","Wait until someone uses click bait titles in their papers: ""I tried this new objective function and you won't believe the result"" ""OMG this new method will blow your mind""",307

lvwt3l,"I come from a traditional engineering field, and here is my observation about ML publication practice lately: I have noticed that there are groups of researchers working on the intersection of ""old"" fields such as optimization, control, signal processing and the like, who will all of a sudden publish a massive amount of paper that purports to solve a certain problem. The problem itself is usually recent and sometimes involves some deep neural network. However, upon close examination, the only novelty is the problem (usually proposed by other unaffiliated groups) but not the method proposed by the researchers that purports to solve it. I was puzzled by why a very large amount of seemingly weak papers, literally rehashing (occasionally, well-known) techniques from the 1980s or even 60s are getting accepted, and I noticed the following recipe: 1. **Only ML conferences.** These groups of researchers will only ever publish in machine learning conferences (and not to optimization and control conferences/journals, where the heart of their work might actually lie). For example, on a paper about adversarial machine learning, the entire paper was actually about solving an optimization problem, but the optimization routine is basically a slight variation of other well studied methods. ***Update***: I also noticed that if a paper does not go through NeurIPS or ICLR, they will be directly sent to AAAI and some other smaller name conferences, where they will be accepted. So nothing goes to waste in this field. 2. **Peers don't know what's going on.** Through openreview, I found that the reviewers (not just the researchers) are uninformed about their particular area, and only seem to comment on the correctness of the paper, but not the novelty. In fact, I doubt the reviewers themselves know about the novelty of the method. ***Update***: by novelty I meant how novel it is with respect to the state-of-the-art of a certain technique, especially when it intersects with operations research, optimization, control, signal processing. The state-of-the-art *could be* far ahead than what mainstream ML folks know about. 3. **Poor citation practices.** Usually the researchers will only cite themselves or other ""machine learning people"" (whatever this means) from the last couple of years. Occasionally, there will be 1 citation from hundreds of years ago attributed to Cauchy, Newton, Fourier, Cournot, Turing, Von Neumann and the like, and then a hundred year jump to 2018 or 2019. I see, ""This problem was studied by *some big name* in 1930 and *Random Guy XYZ* in 2018"" a lot. 4. **Wall of math.** Frequently, there will be a massive wall of math, proving some esoteric condition on the eigenvalue, gradient, Jacobian, and other curious things about their problem (under other esoteric assumptions). There will be several theorems, none of which are applicable because the moment they run their highly non-convex deep learning application, all conditions are violated. Hence the only thing obtained from these intricate theorems + math wall are some faint intuition (which are violated immediately). And then nothing is said.  ***Update***: If I could add one more, it would be that certain techniques, after being proposed, and after the authors claim that it beats a lot of benchmarks, will be seemingly be abandoned and never used again. ML researchers seem to like to jump around topics a lot, so that might be a factor. But usually in other fields, once a technique is proposed, it is refined by the same group of researchers over many years, sometimes over the course of a researcher's career. In some ways, this makes certain area of ML sort of an echo chamber, where researchers are pushing through a large amount of known results rehashed and somewhat disguised by the novelty of their problem and these papers are all getting accepted because no one can detect the lack of novelty (or when they do detect, it is only 1 guy out of 3 reviewers). I just feel like ML conferences are sort of being treated as some sort of automatic paper acceptance cash cow. Just my two cents coming from outside of ML. My observation does not apply to all fields of ML.","Theoretical physicist here. Welcome to the party. This is the exact state of academic research in theoretical physics (and most probably many of the other hard sciences) nowadays. The publish-or-perish mentality is so rooted that no one in their sane mind will try to solve actual hard and meaningful problems, just tweak a feature of a model here, mix and match some approaches there and you have a bunch of publications in your CV. The other side of the coin is the review process and the absolute lack of transparency in terms of methodology used. Half-assed reviews, supervisors  asking students to review articles for them, people being put as authors just because of politics, etc. Long gone are the days where a person could publish a paper after several years without publishing anything, but one that actually solves a relevant problem in science. Luck has increasingly became a factor that is almost most relevant than hard work. Peter Higgs (that guy that got a Nobel  for the proposal of the existence of the Higgs boson and the mechanism in which particles acquire mass) said several times that by nowadays standards, he would never be successful due to the small amount of papers he published.",239

m3boyo,"I have seen so many posts on social media about how great pytorch is and, in one latest tweet, 'boomers' use tensorflow ... It doesn't make sense to me and I see it as being incredibly powerful and widely used in research and industry. Should I be jumping ship? What is the actual difference and why is one favoured over the other? I have only used tensorflow and although I have been using it for a number of years now, still am learning. Should I be switching? Learning both? I'm not sure this post will answer my question but I would like to hear your honest opinion why you use one over the other or when you choose to use one instead of the other. EDIT: thank you all for your responses. I honestly did not expect to get this much information and I will definitely be taking a harder look at Pytorch and maybe trying it in my next project. For those of you in industry, do you see tensorflow used more or Pytorch in a production type implementation? My work uses tensorflow and I have heard it is used more outside of academia - mixed maybe at this point? EDIT2: I read through all the comments and here are my summaries and useful information to anyone new seeing this post or having the same question:  TL;DR: People were so frustrated with TF 1.x that they switched to PT and never came back. * Python is 30 years old FYI  * Apparently JAX is actually where the cool kids are … this is feeling like highschool again, always the wrong crowd.  * Could use pytorch to develop then convert with ONNX to tensorflow for deployment  * When we say TF we should really say tf.keras. I would not wish TF 1.x on my worst enemy.  * Can use PT in Colab. PT is also definitely popular on Kaggle * There seems to be some indie kid rage where big brother google is not loved so TF is not loved.  * TF 2.x with tf.keras and PT seem to now do similar things. However see below for some details. Neither seems perfect but I am now definitely looking at PT. Just looking at the installation and docs is a winner. As a still TF advocate (for the time being) I encourage you to check out TF 2.x - a lot of comments are related to TF 1.x Sessions etc. Reasons for:  * PT can feel laborious. With tf.keras it seems to be simpler and quicker, however also then lack of control.  * Seems to still win the production argument  * TF is now TF.Keras. Eager execution etc. has made it more align with PT  * TF now has numpy implementation right in there. As well as gradient tape in for loop fashion making it actually really easy to manipulate tensors. * PT requires a custom training loop from the get go. Maybe TF 2.x easier then for beginners now and can be faster to get a quick and dirty implementation / transfer learning.  * PT requires to specify the hardware too (?) You need to tell it which gpu to use? This was not mentioned but that is one feeling I had.  * Tf.keras maybe more involved in industry because of short implementation time  * Monitoring systems? Not really mentioned but I don't know what is out there for PT. eg TF dashboard, projector * PT needs precise handling of input output layer sizes. You have to know math. * How is PT on edge devices - is there tfLite equivalent? PT Mobile it seems Reason for Pytorch or against TF: * Pythonic * Actually opensource * Steep learning curve for TF 1.x. Many people seem to have switched and never looked back on TF 2.x. Makes sense since everything is the same for PT since beginning * Easier implementation (it just works is a common comment) * Backward compatibility and framework changes in TF. RIP your 1.x code. Although I have heard there is a tool to auto convert to TF 2.x - never tried it though. I'm sure it fails unless your code is perfect. Pytorch is stable through and through. * Installation. 3000 series GPUs. I already have experience with this. I hate having to install TF on any new system. Looks like PT is easier and more compatible. * Academia is on PT kick. New students learning it as the first. Industry doesn't seem to care much as long as it works and any software devs can use it. * TF has an issue of many features / frameworks trying to be forced together, creating incompatibility issues. Too many ways to do one thing, not all of which will actually do what you need down the road.  * Easier documentation - potentially.  * The separation between what is in tf and tf.keras * Possible deprecation for Jax, although with all the hype I honestly see Jax maybe just becoming TF 3.x * Debug your model by accessing intermediate representations (Is this what MLIR in TF is now?) * Slow TF start-up * PyTorch has added support for ROCm 4.0 which is still in beta. You can now use AMD GPUs! WOW - that would be great, although I like the nvidia monopoly for my stocks! * Although tf.keras is now simple and quick, it may be oversimplified. PT seems to be a nice middle for any experimentation.  Funny / excellent comments:  * ""I'd rather be punched in the face than having to use TensorFlow ever again.""  * "" PyTorch == old-style Lego kits where they gave pretty generic blocks that you could combine to create whatever you want. TensorFlow == new-style Lego kits with a bunch of custom curved smooth blocks, that you can combine to create the exact picture on the box; but is awkward to build anything else.  * On the possibility of dropping TF for Jax. ""So true, Google loves killing things: hangouts, Google plus, my job application..""  * ""I've been using PyTorch a few months now and I've never felt better. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. My eye sight has improved. - Andrej Karpathy (2017)""  * ""I feel like there is 'I gave up on TF and never looked back feel here'"" * ""I hated the clusterfuck of intertwined APIs of TF2.""  * ""…Pytorch had the advantage of being the second framework that could learn from the mistakes of Tensorflow - hence it's huge success.""  * ""Keras is the gateway drug of DL!""  * ""like anything Google related they seemed to put a lot of effort into making the docs extremely unreadable and incomplete""  * ""more practical imo, pytorch is - the yoda bot""  * ""Pytorch easy, tensorflow hard, me lazy, me dumb. Me like pytorch.""","I will answer as a person that generally prefers Tensorflow over Pytorch: Tensorflow had a pretty rough start.  There was awkward `tf.Session`, than there was `tf.Estimator`, than there was no official high level API and everyone sort of wrote their own API (e. g. sonnet from Deepmind). This resulted not only in writing weird cpp like code in Python but also hurt reusability. Someone's repository used tf.Estimator and thus was unusable in your project that uses tf.Keras. Not to mention the headaches, debugging static `tf.Session` and somewhat cryptic wall of errors from the cpp backend. Then came Pytorch which fixed a lot of those Tensorlfow errors. You had one clear API, you had Python-first mindset, there was no static Session and - most importantly - stuff just worked. (Not to mention it was, and still is, pretty fast). I feel like Pytorch had the advantage of being the second framework that could learn from the mistakes of Tensorflow - hence it's huge success. As of 2021, when we have TF 2.x, eager execution and tf.keras the two frameworks are starting to be pretty similar (tf.keras preprocessing layers have almost the same API as torchvision.transforms). Tensorflow still is not perfect and has some way to go, but I'd say that as long as you stick with `tf.keras` as much as possible then you should be good to go.",792
m5miai,"Hi everyone, We are thrilled to announce the public release of SpeechBrain (finally)!SpeechBrain is an open-source toolkit designed to speedup research and development of speech technologies.  It is flexible, modular, easy-to-use and well documented. [https://speechbrain.github.io/](https://speechbrain.github.io/?fbclid=IwAR289EnrgVB9UG_yJFDu_K36kG321wCFiwu1n9D-dOc7-zfDb4sATMKRk5k) Our amazing collaborators worked so hard for more than one year and we hope our efforts will be helpful for the speech and machine learning communities. SpeechBrain currently supports speech recognition, speaker recognition, verification and diarization, spoken language understanding, speech enhancement, speech separation and multi-microphone signal processing. For all these tasks we have competitive or state-of-the-art performance (see [https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain)). SpeechBrain can foster research on speech technology.  It can be useful for pure machine learning scientists as well as companies or students that can easily plug their model into SpeechBrain. We think that speechbrain can also be suitable for beginners. According to our experience and numerous beta testers,  you just need few hours to familiarize yourself with the toolkit.  To you in this process, we prepared many interactive tutorials (Google Colab). Pretrained models are available on HuggingFace so anyone can do ASR, speaker verification, source separation or more with only a few lines of code! ([https://huggingface.co/speechbrain](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain)) We are trying to build a community large enough to keep expanding SpeechBrain's functionality. Your contribution and feedbacks (positives AND negatives) are really important!","Looking forward trying out, and really nice to see integrations with huggingface!  Are you planning to add speech-to-text functionality eventually?",38
m73sy7,"Some of you may have seen me comment around, now it’s time for an official post! I’ve just finished building a little side project of mine - [https://gpu.land/](https://gpu.land/). **What is it?** Cheap GPU instances in the cloud. **Why is it awesome?** * It’s dirt-cheap. You get a Tesla V100 for $0.99/hr, which is 1/3 the cost of AWS/GCP/Azure/\[insert big cloud name\]. * It’s dead simple. It takes 2mins from registration to a launched instance. Instances come pre-installed with everything you need for Deep Learning, including a 1-click Jupyter server. * It sports a retro, MS-DOS-like look. Because why not:) I’m a self-taught ML engineer. I built this because when I was starting my ML journey I was totally lost and frustrated by AWS. Hope this saves some of you some nerve cells (and some pennies)! The most common question I get is - how is this so cheap? The answer is because AWS/GCP are charging you a huge markup and I’m not. In fact I’m charging just enough to break even, and built this project really to give back to community (and to learn some of the tech in the process).  AMA!","Looks great! I just fired up a single V100 instance. Initial thoughts: - It would be cool if I could upload my own public SSH key so I don't have to have yet another private key around.

m8ewph," Recently I gave a talk titled **Geometric Deep Learning: from Euclid to drug design**, where I presented a mathematical framework for the unification of various deep learning architectures (CNNs, GNNs, Transformers, and Spherical-, Mesh-, and Gauge CNNs) from the first principles of invariance and symmetry.

mbhewa,"I recently read the Fast AI deep learning [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50204643-deep-learning-for-coders-with-fastai-and-pytorch) and wanted to summarise some of the many advanced takeaways & tricks I got from it.  I’m going to leave out the basic things because there’s enough posts about them, i’m just focusing on what I found new or special in the book. I’ve also put the insights into a [deck](https://saveall.ai/shared/deck/140&4&3K3uXPazkg4) on save all to help you remember them over the long-term. I would **massively recommend using a spaced repetition app (video** [**explanation**](https://youtu.be/AD0aFdRCskQ)**) like anki or** [**save all**](https://saveall.ai/) **for the things you learn** otherwise you’ll just forget so much of what is important. Here’s the takeaways: # Neural Network Training Fundamentals * Always **start** an ML project by **producing simple baselines**    * If is binary classification then could even be as simple as predicting the most common class in the training dataset    * Other baselines: linear regression, random forest, boosting etc… * Then you can **use your baseline to clean your data** by looking at the datapoints it gets most incorrect and checking to see if they are actually classified correctly in the data * In general you can also **leverage your baselines** to **help debug** your models    * e.g. if you make your neural network 1 layer then it should be able to match the performance of a linear regression baseline, if it doesn’t then you have a bug!    * e.g. if adding a feature improves the performance of linear regression then it should probably also improve the performance of your neural net unless you have a bug! * Hyperparameter optimisation can help a bit (especially for the learning rate) but in general there are default hyperparameters that can do quite well and so **closely** **optimising the hyperparameters should be one of the last things you try** rather than the first * **If you know something** about the problem then try to **inject it as an inductive bias into the training process**    * e.g. if some of your features are related in a sequential way then incorporate them into training separately using an RNN    * e.g. if you know the output should only be between -3 and 3 then use sigmoid to design the final layer so that it forces the output of the network to be in this range # Transfer Learning * Always use transfer learning if you can by finding a model pre-trained for a similar task and then fine-tune that model for your particular task    * e.g. see [huggingface](http://huggingface.co/) for help with this in NLP * **Gradual unfreezing** and **discriminative learning rates** work well when fine-tuning a transfer learned model    * **Gradual unfreezing** = freeze earlier layers and **train the later layers only**, then **gradually unfreeze** the earlier layers one by one    * **Discriminative learning rates** = having **different learning rates per layer of your network** (usually **earlier** **layers** have **smaller learning rates** than later layers) # Tricks to Deal with Overfitting * **Best way** to deal with **overfitting** is by getting **more data**. **Exhaust this first** before you start regularising with other methods * **Data augmentation** is really powerful and now possible with text as well as images:    * **Image** data augmentation -  crop, pad, squish and resize images    * **Text** data augmentation - negate words, replace words with similes, perturb word embeddings (nice github [repo](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) for this) * **Mixup regularisation** = create new data by averaging together training datapoints * **Backwards training (NLP only):** train an additional separate model that is **fed text backwards** and then **average the outputs** of your two models to get your final prediction # Other Tricks to Improve Performance * **Test time augmentation** = at test time, use the **average prediction** from many **augmented versions of the input** as your prediction rather than just the prediction from the true input * **1 cycle training** = when you increase and reduce the learning rate throughout training in a circular fashion (usually makes a **huge difference)** * **Learning rate finder algorithm** = algorithm that Fast AI provide to help you automatically discover roughly the best learning rate * **Never use one-hot encodings,** use **embeddings** instead, even in **tabular data**! * Using **AdamW** instead of **Adam** can help a little bit * **Lower precision training** can help and on [pytorch lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) is just a simple flag you can set * For **regression problems** if you know the **output should be within a range** then its good to use **sigmoid** to force the neural net output to be within this range    * I.e. make the network output:  min\_value + sigmoid(output) \* (max\_value - min\_value) * **Clustering** your features can help you **identify which ones are the most redundant** and then removing the can help performance * **Label smoothing** = use 0.1 and 0.9 instead of 0 and 1 for label targets (can smoothen training) * **Don’t dichotomise** your data, if your output is continuous then its better to train the network to predict continuous values rather than turning it into a classification problem * **Progressive resizing** = train model on smaller resolution images first, then increase resolution gradually (can speed up training a lot) * Strategically using **bottleneck layers** to force the network to form **more compact representations of the data** at different points can be helpful * Try using **skip connections** as they can help smooth out the loss surface &#x200B; Please let me know if you found this helpful and if there are any other training tricks you use that we should also know about?","Can you explain this one Never use one-hot encodings, use embeddings instead, even in tabular data!",65
mdldtt,"Behind paywall: With new machine-learning models coming online daily, the company created a new system to track their impact and maximize user engagement. The process is still the same today. Teams train up a new machine-learning model on FBLearner, whether to change the ranking order of posts or to better catch content that violates Facebook’s community standards (its rules on what is and isn’t allowed on the platform). Then they test the new model on a small subset of Facebook’s users to measure how it changes engagement metrics, such as the number of likes, comments, and shares, says Krishna Gade, who served as the engineering manager for news feed from 2016 to 2018. If a model reduces engagement too much, it’s discarded. Otherwise, it’s deployed and continually monitored. On Twitter, Gade explained that his engineers would get notifications every few days when metrics such as likes or comments were down. Then they’d decipher what had caused the problem and whether any models needed retraining. But this approach soon caused issues. The models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism: put simply, people just like outrageous stuff. Sometimes this inflames existing political tensions. The most devastating example to date is the case of Myanmar, where viral fake news and hate speech about the Rohingya Muslim minority escalated the country’s religious conflict into a full-blown genocide. Facebook admitted in 2018, after years of downplaying its role, that it had not done enough “to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence.” While Facebook may have been oblivious to these consequences in the beginning, it was studying them by 2016. In an internal presentation from that year, reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, a company researcher, Monica Lee, found that Facebook was not only hosting a large number of extremist groups but also promoting them to its users: “64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools,” the presentation said, predominantly thanks to the models behind the “Groups You Should Join” and “Discover” features. https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/","The part of this story that really gets me is reading about all these brilliant people that Facebook (and others) have hoovered up, just to have them spending all their time and energy finding ways to get people to stay a few minutes longer in a stoopid app. What.

mf1xsu,"I needed to finetune the GPT2 1.5 Billion parameter model for a project, but the model didn't fit on my gpu.

mhrpbm,"First of all, this is not a rant about Tensorflow (it actually is but more on that later). Disclaimer: I have been working on research projects with Teano, JAX, PT, TF 1 &2, and of course the original Keras. The **original Keras** was just a high-level API specification for machine learning, which was really nice when collaborating with people who have less engineering background. The API was framework agnostic and the main implementation supported multiple backends (Teano, Tensorflow, and MS-CNTK) Essentially, the API design resembled the abstractions of modern high-level frameworks such as PyTorch-Lightning and fast.ai, with slightly different *design* *flavors* (e.g., a Keras model combines the network with the metrics and training code in a single object, whereas other frameworks usually separate the network from the learner object). The huge advantage of keras was that it was available and the API stable **back in 2016, 2017.** I think this is something remarkable in a field that moves so fast. But then, you know the story, Google announced its plans to incorporated it into Tensorflow 2. This wouldn't have been a problem on its own, but it slowly killed keras for 3 reasons: 1. During the time-span of this merge, the keras API was effectively ""frozen"", making it lag behind alternatives in terms of features 2. The release of TF2 came too late. On top of that, the first versions were buggy and even now are lacking some basic features. 3. Instead of making a hard cut between TF 1 and 2, Google decided that it's better to carried over a lot of baggage and crap from TF1, making the framework extremely bloated. When something does not work, you get overwhelmed by long cryptic error messages and stacktraces longer than your screen can visualize. So, this post is really intended as a **funeral for the keras API**. Looking forward to know your thoughts. EDIT: I have nothing personal against Google. Far from it, I really like their impressive contributions to ML (Colab, TPU, JAX, ...), but the story with keras and TF2 is really frustrating for me who liked working with it in the past.",did u just want to create this month's drama lol,158

mocpgj,"Using NumPy’s random number generator with multi-process data loading in PyTorch causes identical augmentations unless you specifically set seeds using the worker\_init\_fn option in the DataLoader. I didn’t and this bug silently regressed my model’s accuracy. How many others has this bug done damage to? Curious, I downloaded over a hundred thousand repositories from GitHub that import PyTorch, and analysed their source code. I kept projects that define a custom dataset, use NumPy’s random number generator with multi-process data loading, and are more-or-less straightforward to analyse using abstract syntax trees. Out of these, over 95% of the repositories are plagued by this problem. It’s inside PyTorch's official tutorial, OpenAI’s code, and NVIDIA’s projects. Even Karpathy admitted falling prey to it. For example, the following image shows the duplicated random crop augmentations you get when you blindly follow the official PyTorch tutorial on custom datasets: https://preview.redd.it/pccy5wskpes61.png?width=1652&format=png&auto=webp&s=f292d0282ad954cbac2c693a9656d62fa0dd9682 You can read more details [here](https://tanelp.github.io/posts/a-bug-that-plagues-thousands-of-open-source-ml-projects/).","Perhaps people are misunderstanding the issue - the problem isn't that setting a specific random seed results in the same sequence of random numbers being generated during each training run (which would obviously be ""working as intended""). I think the problem is that each of the multiple dataloading processes (set by num_workers in pytorch right?) will output the same sequence of random numbers during one particular training run. This could certainly mess up projects depending on how you are doing your dataloading and augmentations (speaking from experience). Even if it is ""working as intended"", it is good that you've pointed this out to a wider audience! Also the easy fix would be to use torch random numbers instead I think (as mentioned in OP's link) Edit: Relevant github issue here: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/5059",93

myiw7e,"# Background I recently graduated with a master's degree and was fortunate/unfortunate to glimpse the whole ""Academic"" side of ML. I took a thesis track in my degree because as an immigrant it's harder to get into a good research lab without having authorship in a couple of good papers  (Or so I delude myself ).  I worked as a Full-stack SWE for a startup for 4+ years before coming to the US for a master’s degree focused on ML and AI. I did everything in those years. From project management to building fully polished S/W products to DevOps to even dabbled in ML. I did my Batchelor’s degree from a university whose name is not even worth mentioning. The university for my master’s degree is in the top 20 in the AI space.  I didn't know much about ML and the curiosity drove me to university.   Come to uni and I focused on learning ML and AI for one 1-1.5 years after which I found advisors for a thesis topic. This is when the fun starts. I had the most amazing advisors but the entire peer review system and the way we assess ML/Science is what ticked me off. This is where the rant begins.  # Rant 1:Acadmia follows a Gated Institutional Narrative Let's say you are a Ph.D. at the world's top AI institution working under the best prof. You have a way higher likelihood of you getting a good Postdoc at a huge research lab vs someone's from my poor country doing a Ph.D. with a not-so-well-known advisor having published not-so-well-known papers. I come from a developing nation and I see this many times here. In my country academics don't get funding as they do at colleges in the US. One of the reasons for this is that colleges don't have such huge endowments and many academics don't have wealthy research sponsors.  Brand names and prestige carry massive weight to help get funding in US academic circles. This prestige/money percolates down to the students and the researchers who work there. Students in top colleges get a huge advantage and the circles of top researchers keep being from the same sets of institutions. I have nothing against top researchers from top institutions but due to the nature of citations and the way the money flows based on them, a vicious cycle is created where the best institutions keep getting better and the rest don't get as much of a notice.  # Rant 2: Peer Review without Code Review in ML/AI is shady  I am a computer scientist and I was appalled when I heard that you don't need to do code reviews for research papers. As a computer scientist and someone who actually did shit tons of actual ML in the past year, I find it absolutely garbage that code reviews are not a part of this system. I am not saying every scientist who reads a paper should review code but at least one person should for any paper's code submission. At least in ML and AI space. This is basic. I don't get why people call themselves computer scientists if they don't want to read the fucking code. If you can't then make a grad student do it. But for the collective of science, we need this.   ***The core problem lies in the fact that peer review is free. :*** There should be better solutions for this. We ended up creating Git and that changed so many lives. Academic Research needs something similar. # Rant 3: My Idea is Novel Until I see Someone Else's Paper The volume of scientific research is growing exponentially. Information is being created faster than we can digest.  We can't expect people to know everything and the amount of overlap in the AI/ML fields requires way better search engines than Google Scholar.  The side effect of large volumes of research is that every paper is doing something ""novel"" making it harder to filter what the fuck was novel.  I have had so many experiences where I coded up something and came to realize that someone else has done something symbolically similar and my work just seems like a small variant of that. That's what fucks with my head. Is what I did in Novel? What the fuck is Novel? Is stitching up a transformer to any problem with fancy embeddings and tidying it up as a research paper Novel? Is just making a transformer bigger Novel?  Is some new RL algorithm tested with 5 seeds and some fancy fucking prior and some esoteric reasoning for its success Novel? Is using an over parameterized model to get 95% accuracy on 200 sample test set Novel? Is apply Self-supervised learning for some new dataset Novel? If I keep on listing questions on novelty, I can probably write a novel asking about what the fuck is ""Novel"".  # Rant 4: Citation Based Optimization Promotes Self Growth Over Collective Growth Whatever people may say about collaboration, Academia intrinsically doesn't promote the right incentive structures to harbor collaboration. Let me explain, When you write a paper, the position of your name matters. If you are just a Ph.D. student and a first author to a paper, it's great. If you are an nth author Not so great. Apparently, this is a very touchy thing for academics. And lots of egos can clash around numbering and ordering of names.  I distinctly remember once attending some seminar in a lab and approaching a few students on research project ideas. The first thing that came out of the PhD student's mouth was the position in authorship. As an engineer who worked with teams in the past, this was never something I had thought about. Especially because I worked in industry, where it's always the group over the person. Academia is the reverse. Academia applauds the celebration of the individual's achievements.  All of this is understandable but it's something I don't like. This makes PhDs stick to their lane. The way citations/research-focus calibrate the ""hire-ability"" and ""completion of Ph.D. thesis"" metrics, people are incentivized to think about themselves instead of thinking about collaborations for making something better.  # Conclusion A Ph.D. in its most idealistic sense for me is the pursuit of hard ideas(I am poetic that way). In a situation like now when you have to publish or perish and words on paper get passed off as science without even seeing the code that runs it, I am extremely discouraged to go down that route.  All these rants are not to diss on scientists. I did them because ""we"" as a community need better ways to addressing some of these problems.  P.S. Never expected so many people to express their opinions about this rant.  U shouldn’t take this seriously. As many people have stated I am an outsider with tiny experience to give a full picture. I realize that my post as coming out as something which tries to dichotomize academia and industry. I am not trying to do that. I wanted to highlight some problems I saw for which there is no one person to blame. These issues are in my opinion a byproduct of the economics which created this system.

n62qhn,"TL;DR: Got scooped by MLP-Mixer, so I'm releasing my writeup/code/models. I hope someone finds them interesting/useful. Lately I've been trying a couple variants of simple vision transformers to better understand what makes them perform well. About a month ago, I found that you could replace the attention layers with feed-forward layers and get quite good results. Last week I started a short writeup of the experiment (just a few pages, as I didn't see it as a full paper). Today Google put out a paper (MLP-Mixer) that proposes exactly the same architecture. When I saw the paper earlier today I considered scrapping what I had done, but now I figure that I might as well just put it out there. For those who are interested, here's a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lukemelas/do-you-even-need-attention) with pretrained models, a [W&B log](https://wandb.ai/lukemelas2/deit-experiments/reports/Do-You-Even-Need-Attention---Vmlldzo2NjUxMzI?accessToken=8kebvweue0gd1s6qiav2orco97v85glogsi8i83576j42bb1g39e59px56lkk4zu) of the experiments, and a 3-page [writeup](https://github.com/lukemelas/do-you-even-need-attention/blob/main/Do-You-Even-Need-Attention.pdf). Also, if anyone has stories about getting scooped, feel free to share -- I'd imagine people have some crazy stories. Edit: Wow, thank you all for the support! I really didn't expect this. Based on your suggestions, I've also uploaded a version of the report to arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02723](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02723) ","Ouch. My condolences. Skimming your paper it's seem pretty much the same as the MLP-mixer, except for the fancy figures and long-ass experiments sections in the big data regime from mixer. Just curious, when you started out in this direction, do you think you have the compute needed (maybe by asking for a one-time funding in addition to your normal compute) to perform the experiments similar to theirs? I believe that's if you have the insight and capability to implement that, you already know/guess the advantages and disadvantage (i.e less inductive biases, more data + compute). For me as a lone PhD student with relative few resource, I mostly never follow on the idea / improvement I have while reading if the paper is from a big lab, use big compute or in a popular subfield (e.g transformer + vision atm). I just note down my idea, usually wait for a month or two and there it's a follow up paper (usually from the same lab) just as I imagined. .... Still finding my niche ... Edit: Just stalk your profile. You're in the VGG group so I guess compute is not your problem and you can totally pull this off if time's on your side. My condolences again.",113
n7qrz5,"I've worked with many scientists from many different fields and backgrounds, but none come close to the obnoxiousness, pomposity, and outright unpalatable know-it-all vibe from the machine learning community. And I'm sure it's a case of a small rotten bunch smearing the whole field. This behaviour is most rife in 3 places: the cesspit known as Twitter, Reddit, and somewhat in industry. It's much less rampant, comparatively, in academia in my experience (and just so we're clear, Google Brain/DeepMind/FAIR is not academia). Here is some of what I've observed: * Think they can dominate a field or little involvement from SMEs    * Often I see in machine learning a group or groups will swarm on a problem, throw ML at the data, and call the problem ""solved"". Very little (if any) SME involved, and importantly, no follow up. The exceptions to this general are few and far between. * DL encourages a habit of not learning the basics    * I have encountered this so often, and it is especially apparent in DL. People will jump straight into e.g. CV or NLP, and not bother learning anything foundational. I've seen and spoken to  numerous people publishing in CV papers in prestigious conferences who don't even know what why colour spaces are useful or even what a pixel is (because it sure as fuck isn't a small square on an image). You may claim that they don't need to know this, but that delusional talk, and they absolutely do. There is a limit to what compute + CNN/transformer can do. After that, you need foundations to know how to improve. * No real work goes into the vast majority of papers (more of a DL problem)    * This has been cited by many in the past. However, I must articulate it myself. I also understand that there are many contributing factors to this (and indeed all the other) problem. It's most often slight architecture change or incremental improvement, with no real thought gone into the paper. What this sometimes results in (I have seen numerous times myself in a variety of settings - including my own teams) is a PhD being no good at engineering, or less productive at research than an MSc with experience under his belt. The whole point of a PhD coming into an ML team is to be useful at R&D, and that is not always the case (as much as you'd expect). * Insolence and arrogance of fairness/ethics crowd    * This crowd - as it currently operates - simply serves as a cancerous tumour to the ML world. There always point out problems, but never (real) solutions. They act like gatekeepers and god's gift to the world. It brings about massive toxicity to the virtual ML community, and prohibits free speech of the community without fear of repercussions. The this crowd could do with an overhaul, as its leaders are some of the most vitriolic yobos who claim to be academics. * For such an applied field, very little focus on applications    * Often the excuse put forward is that fields like math have very few applications straight away. Firstly, ML is not like math - it's more like straight up engineering (especially DL). It's primarily applied, and should thus be much more focused on application. Your slight architecture change or you 0.5% improvement on ImageNet is not a Pythagoreon theorem waiting to happen. It's laziness and just wanting to get your PhD (surely if doing a PhD you actually want to make a real contribution to the field that you can stand behind?). Fields like physics and stats are often applied and make a real world impact with the applications. To be fair, ML also does, but nowhere near as much as it should, especially at your average company in industry. * Can fix all the worlds problems    * Over-stating the ability of ML. Not sure if delusion, PR, or a combination of both. Cited lots before by others. &#x200B; EDIT 1:I don't know why people are focusing on the definition of a pixel. I reiterate that is the ""small square"" model is helpful, useful, and enough for your work/application, then that's great and you should use that. But don't claim your helpful model to be the definition - because it's not. I don't understand why I'm being downvoted for this :/ Thanks for the discussion. I want to understand the Reddit ML community's views on the original content of this post (minus the pixels). &#x200B; EDIT2:   Realised it would be better to put this here, than in the comment as I did:    Regarding the ethics crowd - I see many people have commented and require me to clarify my position. I  feel they intentionally try to make mountains out of molehills, and  often (at least from an online perspective) do not want to engage in  civil discourse or debate when presented to them (instead wanting to  just blame and live in their echo chamber). They act like saviours and  pretentious, as if they are doing god's work. The purpose of  ethics/fairness is to try change things to be more ethics/fair in your  community. It's not to perpetually live in your little echo chamber and  try ""cancel"" those who disagree. Utter toxicity. Never  mind the fact that many of the popular ""researchers"" in that space  preach against toxic large tech companies/CEOs, unfair practices at top  universities and companies, etc., but they are the first to be working  at places like Google, DeepMind, Microsoft, and attending universities  like Stanford and CMU. If you really want to make a difference to the  plight of POC in tech, then why are you working for DeepMind? Go work  for, or consult for, some little random African start up then to empower  them? Fucking hypocritical, will do whatever is convenient and easy.  Simply a popularity contest. Again,  I found myself venting as I am quite fervent about this. However, with  them it's so often such an apparent display of self-entitlement and  superiority. Granted this is simply from my observations mostly online,  but also somewhat in-person.   ","i agree with u/svantana , there is simply tooooo much (easy) money in this field at this moment. That much money can quickly and significantly change the dynamic of a scientific research community. Just randomly type a ML word ( I just tried ""xgboost"" ) in google and go through the first 2 pages of results: half of the results are about monetization. When money is driving the community (and a large portion of the research activities), what you described is almost doomed to happen. Here are my 0.02 wrt what you mentioned: ""Think they can dominate a field or little involvement from SMEs"" and ""Can fix all the worlds problems"" : they have to think and talk like this, they have no choice: when their startup appear on Bloomberg front page, they must  say ""a startup backed by XXX Capital has made global XXX more efficent"", bloomberg will not publish an article saying "" a 2-men shop git-checkout lightgbm on an aws micro instance and start processing xxx data from a csv file"". that's lame. ""No real work goes into the vast majority of papers"": academia has been like this for at least 20 years: ""publish or perish"" , researchers have no choice. They have to write something, even they know it's not substantial. This is definitely not a ML/DL-specific issue.",242

This field emerged around a list of research questions that were not answered within the classical framework of learning theory. These questions concern: the outstanding generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the role of depth in deep architectures, the apparent absence of the curse of dimensionality, the surprisingly successful optimization performance despite the non-convexity of the problem, understanding what features are learned, why deep architectures perform exceptionally well in physical problems, and which fine aspects of an architecture affect the behavior of a learning task in which way.
