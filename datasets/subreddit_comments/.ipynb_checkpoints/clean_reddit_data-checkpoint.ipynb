I m wondering as your wealth grew, or you became rich , what changes occurred that you did not expect? EDIT: I m getting a lot of what about wealthy women? questions. I just want to say, I am asking males because I m a male myself so I feel their experiences to be more relatable, this is the r/askmen sub and you are very free to ask women the same question on the r/askwomen sub.

Women don t throw themselves at me nor do I think they re after my money. I travel a lot. I almost never cook for myself. I default to ordering in or picking up fast food. I love fancy restaurants. I still struggle to spend money on some things. And yet on other things, I ll drop thousands of dollars without blinking. The biggest change for me has been motivation. I used to love working and now I m struggling to be excited about anything. The biggest challenge is teaching my kids how to be self sufficient. I had house cleaners and cancelled the service. We do our own house chores. I do my own yard work. I still want them to have pride in ownership and recognize that there isn t a magical money tree.'"
