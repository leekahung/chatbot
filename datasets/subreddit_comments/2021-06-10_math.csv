In short, the Common Core introduces newfangled methods for doing mathematics that contain unnecessary or inexplicable steps and are vastly inferior to the methods we have been using for hundreds of years. Take, for example, this multiplication problem: http://imgur.com/0TDJAcR The new Common Core way of doing this problem is a mess; it throws in random digits (called ""partial products"") and haphazardly omits digits from positions based on a mysterious pseudoscientific principle the Reform Math beatniks call ""place value.""  The Common Core calls this the ""standard algorithm,"" probably alluding to federal efforts to standardize the school curriculum and the way we teach our kids. If you think that's an embarrassment, look at what the Common Core has done to division: http://imgur.com/sQTq0tH For hundreds of years we've used the old reliable method of dividing whole numbers by moving from left to right, and sometimes up and down, to record calculations while also crossing out old ones.  This method gives you everything you want from an algorithm: at each stage it is obvious what to do next; it's efficient from start to finish; and it clearly records your work so that you or your friend can verify the steps.  Now, the Common Core-industrial complex is forcing students to meander aimlessly through this ""long division algorithm"" that produces a cascade of digits and symbols (like the upside-down L and the hyphens) that don't follow any rules or reason. If you think the Common Core has made a mockery of elementary mathematics, wait till you see what they've done with high school algebra: http://imgur.com/cYBLWpZ It used to be that you could just solve a quadratic equation using an obvious u-substitution to split the difference, rearrange the resulting difference of squares, and follow the cases to get the solutions, and everybody minded their own business.  But the busybodies behind the Common Core are insisting that students use a dadaistic ""quadratic formula.""  In case you haven't met this horrific creation yet, it transforms a single equation in one variable into a single equation in four variables (x, a, b, c), with some of the variables later taking on variables that, one can only surmise, are assigned arbitrarily.  Note that even if you don't mind the tortured mess this method creates, it's hard to escape the fact that *it doesn't even produce the correct answer.* Even as it makes math more difficult for children from elementary to high school, the Common Core is imposing low expectations on our students.  Consider this problem involving addition of fractions: http://imgur.com/a/yshMI Students used to be expected to go through an organized process of finding the least common denominator, converting both addends so that they have that common denominator, adding the numerators, and then reducing the resulting fraction to lowest terms.  This was a simple, straightforward process that required only basic fraction sense, understanding of whole-number addition, and a first-semester course in undergraduate number theory.  Now, the Common Core is saying it's okay not to worry about least common denominators; and if your answer isn't reduced, well, to-may-to / to-mah-to.  The Common Core is introducing all of this ""problem solving"" that relies on sudden insight and creative thinking and getting math away from what children should be doing: learning to operate on numbers according to pre-specified routines and instructions to produce a simple numerical output - you know, the sort of work that will position our kids for jobs that will exist well into the 21st century. The Common Core Standards are throwing out a lot of what was great about mathematics - the focus on computation, the strict adherence to rigid procedures, the focus on the one right answer - and bowing to the new gods of ""conceptual understanding,"" ""algebraic thinking,"" and ""problem solving.""  I urge you to join me in resisting this race to the bottom. TL;DR: The Common Core is taking mathematics that has worked perfectly well for hundreds of years and turning it into an unintelligible mess.  We must think of what this is doing to our children.

3gqqe5,"While scrolling through /r/all yesterday, I came upon [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/3gmz9w/futurama_hidden_jokes_and_secrets/) from /r/futurama. The linked album reveals the following 'hidden secret' from Season 9 Episode 9, 'Free Will Hunting', accompanied by [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/tGp8Mhw.png):  ""10011101 = 157, the largest known number with a square that is an anagram to the square of the next integer (158)"" While the Futurama writers are known to be mathemtically inclined, this got my Spidey-senses tingling. I consulted the most reliable source at hand, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/157_(number\)), which reiterates: ""In base 10, 157^2 is 24649, and 158^2 is 24964, which uses the same digits. 157 is the largest known number with a square that relates in this way to the square of the next integer."" I was still skeptical, since this really doesn't seem like a very difficult property to satisfy. So I coded up a very quick Python script and set it up to run on my machine overnight:     import collections     curr = 0     while True:         if collections.Counter(str(curr**2)) == collections.Counter(str((curr+1)**2)):             print curr         curr+= 1 		 (collections.Counter objects are [multisets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset)) To my surprise, the program started spouting off hits immediately:     13     157     913     4513     14647     ... It's no error. 913^2 = 833569 and 914^2 = 835396, which are anagrams. I thought maybe the fact was supposed to be that 157 is the largest known *prime* number with this property, but 4513 is prime too, and 4513^2 = 20367169 and 4514^2 = 20376196. Going back to Wikipedia, this factoid (noun: an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print [[1\]](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/factoid)) was actually the first substantive content added to the page for 157 way back in [November 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=157_(number\)&oldid=11515328) by one 'Anton Mravcek'. It now appears in Futurama-related contexts like [this Buzzfeed list](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mikesilv/29-hidden-futurama-jokes-secrets-1nbmy#.mxpM6GjK1) and [IMDB trivia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2005623/trivia), but has also made its way into some unrelated pages like [this list](http://www.archimedes-lab.org/numbers/Num70_200.html) of 'What's Special About This Number?' and probably others with even more different wordings. I'll edit the Wikipedia page later and remove this factoid, and try to contact the other websites about removing their incorrect statements. Since the same list of Futurama 'secrets' is undoubtedly going to continue to be shared, hopefully anyone skeptical enough to Google that secret will find this page disproving it.

I think I have found a solution (If you know some things about conic sections you may be able to come up with the solution as well): The cup would be a hyperboloid (of one sheet) and the rim of the saucer would be locus of the focal points of the hyperbolas on its surface. I've thought this through for the ""two dimensional"" (hyperbola) case and would think it would also work in three dimensions.

5zotrq,"If you were with someone who could barely read the words on a menu at a restaurant and they responded casually with, ""Oh I'm just bad a reading"" that would be unacceptable. You would be concerned about their education. They don't have to LOVE reading or be able to make out sloppy cursive writing but you'd expect them to have a certain level of competency in reading so that they do everyday tasks.  In middle school and high school I did horribly in math but my excuse was always, ""I'm just bad at math. Not like Kevin who's naturally gifted."" And pretty much everyone just let me get away with it. Even my own teachers didn't push me very hard. It took me a long time to realize Kevin was good at math because he practiced problems everyday for the same amount of time I read books. It just seemed like the subject was one of those things you were either bad at or good at. If you needed to practice it you were already a failure starting out way behind those naturally talented humans. I've returned to college recently to pursue computer science. Basic algebra like ""10 + x = 12 what is x"" used to be the bane of my existence. Now I'm in Calculus and it still sucks but I can do it. Thanks to practice, tutors, and the internet.  But I can't help but think how much faster I could have gotten through this if my high school wasn't so quick to divide up students between ""Bad at math. Lost cause."" and ""Naturally gifted in math. Mostly ignore."" I wonder right now if there's a bunch of students starting their Freshmen year whose struggle will be dismissed turning them away from the growing demand and high paying positions in STEM related fields. There are lot of problems with the U.S. and the maths and sciences but it starts with letting kids off the hook who excuse poor grades by saying, ""I'm just bad at math."" Those are the people who should be showered with resources. Extra focus on problem chapters, reviewing failed tests, more tutors, better trained teachers, more encouragement etc. There are few things you can't do if you practice enough. You may not be the best or most gifted, but being average at something is way better than complete ignorance. ","It's when I see posts like these that I'm glad I had the teachers I had. I was put into the lowest set for maths after my first year of secondary school, but rather than treat us like we had no hope of getting better our teacher just went through every concept slowly, explaining every detail slowly. At some point it just clicked, and I managed to get out of bottom set maths and into a good university. I still honestly believe that I owe all that to having a patient teacher when I needed it.",366

6rqc9o," [Order seven Harding Traverse](http://imgur.com/EqUmtOj)   A few months ago, my dad told me a simple joke. It went as follows: ""Two statisticians were shooting arrows at targets. One of them shot 10 feet to the right, and the other shot 10 feet to the left. They both cheered and high-fived."".     This got me thinking about how averages work. Specifically, average of locations. I modified the problem so that a marksman (one of the people firing the arrows) could only shoot directly in front of them. Then I set it up so that only one marksman could fire per turn. I then represented this using 1's and 0's (1 meaning that the marksman has fired, and 0 meaning that they haven't). For instance, if there where a row of three marksmen, and the left most marksman shot first (represented by {1,0,0}), then the average locations of all the arrows fired would obviously be directly in-front of the left most marksman. If then, after that, the right most marksman fires {1,0,1}, then the average location will have moved to the middle, directly in front of the central marksman. However, if instead the central marksman fired second {1,1,0}, the average location of the arrows will be in between the left most and central marksman. Now, I decided to represent this on graph paper, each turn (someone firing) would be represented with a step up on the y axis. The average locations of the arrows would be represented by the x axis. I graphed all the possible orders of the marksmen firing, and their subsequent averages, and got a shape that ended up looking like this:    [Order three Harding traverse](http://imgur.com/lfJrUsm)  (the three digit numbers label the paths, showing which marksmen have fired, and which haven't. once all marksmen have fired, the average location is obviously in the middle) Take note that in later iterations of this (meaning that there are more marksmen to start off with), you get situations such as {1,1,0,1}. This value's actual average location wouldn't be directly above, or directly in between  any two marksmen, meaning that it would be difficult to graph it. Because of this, I decided that the average to {1,1,0,1} should be directly above the second 1, because it has a 1 on either side of it. This means that {1,1,1,0,0,}{1,1,0,1,0} and {1,1,0,0,1} all have the same averages. This goes for a set of an even amount of values. If there where four 1's in a value, their average location would be in between the central two 1's.     I started going further with this concept. Instead of having a messy graph represent all of the possible combinations of firing orders, I decided to just simply write all of the possibilities out in numbers: (this is for an order 4 situation, meaning that there are 4 marksmen.) [All possible 4 digit binary paths](http://imgur.com/vPowsjw) Now, while doing this, I noticed something very interesting. In this situation with four marksmen -[Order four Harding Traverse](http://imgur.com/bVKBq8h)-, I noticed that there where two ways to get to {1,1,0,0} (from {1,0,0,0}, and from {0,1,0,0}). This translated into the shape in that the value {1,1,0,0} (on the 2nd move, in between the first and second marksmen), where there where two lines leading in to it. This would make sense, because the lines represent the two paths from {1,0,0,0} and {0,1,0,0}.     I have yet to find anything else interesting about this problem I have made. I assume this has been done before, and has been recorded much more professionally than I have, but I have yet to find it. I leave you with the order 7 Harding Traverse, which I have named after me and my dad, who's lame joke inspired me to do all of this. Enjoy.

7e3qon,"I'm here because I love math, and I want to get into grad school for pure math, but my grades are really worrying, and my GPA is not excellent to begin with. The average for the class right now is 50%, which is a failing grade, and the instructor is not planning on curving it. On our most recent midterm, students got an average of 5.6/15 on the long-answer section. 30-40% of the class has already dropped out or are not showing up to class. We had a full house at the beginning of the semester, it was hard to find a seat, but now it seems like 50% of the students attend on any given day.  There are some issues I have with the professor's teaching style (he does not do examples in class, all of his class notes are sloppily scrawled on a piece of paper which he puts up on the projector. I don't find that the theorems or the main topics are clearly emphasized in these notes). So I am learning most of the material outside of class. But then there is also clearly something wrong with how I'm learning.  I usually go about targeting my studying for the midterm 2-3 weeks before the midterm. I do as many of the assignment problems as I can, but most of my focus is on defining the information in a holistic way, so that I can see the bigger picture. But again, a lot of that initial time is spent actually learning the material on my own. I make summary sheets and do examples from multiple resources. I look back to the beginning of my notes constantly, I go through his lecture slides online. I am studying an hour or more each day, and about a week before the midterms I usually study 4+ hours. This course has taken so much time away from my other courses, and I am definitely worried about how it is impacting my grades there. In addition, I am feeling almost constant stress daily. I have tension headaches and anxiety attacks. It is exhausting, especially because I know there are things I could do to improve my studying, it's just that I don't have the mental resources to do them all without breaking down. It gets to the point where I forget to shower, I forget to eat. When I do feel like I should take a break I feel like I'm wasting time. It's always nagging at me, and I feel so guilty for not doing everything I could do to do well.  However, I enjoy my studying most of the time, I have fun doing math. This is a subject I feel passionate about inherently. I went into the most recent midterm feeling confident as well. I knew I didn't have about 10% of the material ""automatic"", but I thought that 90% would carry me and that I'd do well. But now I'm feeling quite dejected. My study habits are definitely improving, but I don't see the pay-off. I feel more confident in my mathematics ability compared to previous years, but it is not showing in my grades.  I don't know what to do, and I really need some advice.  Thanks for taking the time to read this. ","Great questions! **I'm the instructor for this course**, so I can help answer some of these as well as provide context.  **Tl; Dr.** Change your perspective about the value and purpose of lectures and labs. Lectures are where the seeds get planted, labs, office hours and independent studying is where the tree grows. ***** Here's the guidance I gave on how to study, in this document released three weeks before the midterm: https://drive.google.com/open?id=16-0mY1AK62JtKoCqZ5VDX0HQaXwcGLcb It also gives you strategies for studying: ***** * Start studying early. * If you don’t know how do perform a basic technique (i.e. long division, completing the square, how to sketch an inverse function, what ln(x) is) look it up and learn it. * Understand all the examples in the slides and the textbook. Try to replicate all of the results and computations without looking at how the slides/textbook did them. * Make sure you can give full solutions to all lab problems and Lyryx solutions. * If you are getting stuck or need advice, please ask questions in office hours or during the continuous tutorials. * Make small modifications to the examples in the slides/labs/assignments/textbook and try to solve them; or take identify the key techniques in each section and try to apply it in a different section (that’s basically how I come up with test questions). Here’s the advice I gave in the “marking breakdown” for midterm 1: 1. Understand all of the words: Partial sum, series, terms, monotone, increasing/decreasing, alternating, etc. 2. Become very familiar with geometric series (especially r = 1/2) and p-series (especially p = 1,2). Learn everything you can about these. Try to push them into every test. 3. Understand the technical statement and intuition behind each test. (Is there a picture for the test?) 4. For each test give an example of a series that the test says something about. 5. Say what each test is good for. 6. Understand and reproduce all the (basic) examples in lecture. Change around some of the constants and see what happens. Try to make guesses about families of series. 7. Do all lab problems! They are helpful. ***** The midterm was *very heavily* drawn from the lectures, the labs and the sample problems posted (which you can verify for yourself here). https://drive.google.com/open?id=1atvFy3uZE_kO1QSEoSijjKsRcgdjKs-I * 17/50 of the marks were taken directly from the labs. * 29/50 of the marks were taken directly from the lectures. * 15/50 of the marks were taken directly from the sample problems. (Yes, that adds up to more than 50 marks because some topics are represented in multiple places). Very surprisingly, **the first long answer question had a median of 0**, despite it being presented in class and being one of the sample long answer questions. The second question had an average of under 3, despite the fact that it is solvable completely using precalc methods and it was a sample long answer question (it was included as a more-or-less free question). I'm not sure what else I can really do when I telegraph what is going to be on the midterm, and it still isn't aced. ***** Before I address some specific points, let me say that math can be technical, challenging and demanding. I have failed math tests before. Many of my colleagues (/u/cromonolith) have failed the very classes they now teach. That's not a judgement of our character; it's a measurement of where we are at that point in our careers. Calculus doesn't click for many people the first time they take it, and *that's okay*. For a long time group theory (a third year class) didn't make *any* sense to me at all, and it wasn't until I was a month into my first group theory class that it started to click. **You're a smart person with a passion for math; and that's awesome. Keep that passion, and spark with you.** ***** Some specific points: > We had a full house at the beginning of the semester, it was hard to find a seat, but now it seems like 50% of the students attend on any given day. That's how (1) every university class goes, and (2) how every first year math class goes. The material builds on itself and people give up because they fall behind. Our class is not an outlier (and in fact has *higher* attendance at this point of the term than I would expect). > There are some issues I have with the professor's teaching style (he does not do examples in class,  To be blunt: this is not true. Every topic gets 1-3 examples, and that's the most we can do in lecture (for time constraints). The other examples are relegated to the labs (which have full solutions posted) and the textbook. > all of his class notes are sloppily scrawled on a piece of paper which he puts up on the projector.  People can judge for themselves what qualifies as ""sloppy"" and ""scrawled"": https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wATR2y9owHhRfwNz4w_qoye2CdmB1Sbg > So I am learning most of the material outside of class. This is a feature not a bug! Math is not a spectator sport. You cannot learn math by observation, you must *do*. The lectures are for intuition, motivation, guidance and making the theorems and techniques concrete and relatable. We present the minimal working examples that contain new behaviour and work with them to really understand the building blocks. The labs go into more depth and present problems with more moving parts ""scaffolded"" into bite size pieces so that students can tackle them one part at a time. For example, here's [our lab about sequences vs series](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w9tI6VnO6jblLBR1ak59FtWChNzphu8j) (a topic which is *very* confusing for students). This lab is designed to engage students by getting them to play around with sequences and series, to ""get their hands dirty"" and pull these concepts out of the abstract. **This is where your major learning should happen**. You [productively struggle](http://maateachingtidbits.blogspot.ca/2017/11/the-role-of-failure-and-struggle-in.html) with the material while having the support of an expert in mathematics. ***** Come talk to me. My door is open. ****** **edit**. I'm glad people have been excited to talk about learning strategies, pedagogy and penmanship! Some things to clarify: * **It's not true that 50% of my class is failing**. Only the long answer portion of Midterm 2 has been marked which is worth (15/50); the MC section worth (35/50) is still being processed. Midterm 1 went normally, the assignment grades are high. * **Penmanship**. I have considered typing up my notes, but it's just far too time consuming for me at this stage of my career. I'm a post doc with many other commitments, including other courses to teach. (Yes, I understand the irony of writing so much in Reddit for the past day.) Thank you everyone for the feedback. It's a humbling experience to justify my teaching methods to peers. I will continue to read the feedback, but I'm extremely busy this week preparing for a job interview, so I likely won't respond. I'll let people know how the course turns out in December.",10403

I may or may not follow a single textbook for each such series; for example, the big idea in my head right now is a sort of walk through baby Rudin, casting light on certain things that I feel he leaves in the dark, but I may also supplement this with other classical intro to analysis textbooks.

a0g2m2,"This is obviously pretty subjective. But I still want to make a shit post about math because it seems fun.  &#x200B; I have created a system to rank each mathematician by the following criteria ranked out of 10: Applicability/importance of their contributions, how distinguished they are, and how wild their life was (obstensibly). You may be asking about the last one, and that one is because mathematicians are more than just their math or something I dont know I couldnt think of anything else. Then I'll find the mean of each of these criteria to get a final rating. I'll go in chronological order starting with Pythagoras. &#x200B; **Pythagoras:** a\^2 + b\^2 = c\^2. That is about all this guy did mathematically other than worship triangular numbers and fucking drown Hippasus for proving the existence of irrational numbers (maybe). Nonetheless, this theorem is used by millions of people daily including lost trigonometry and geometry high school students, right triangle lovers, and architects I bet. I just hope all of the above dont attempt to solve a right triangle with both legs equaling 1 in case Pythagoras comes back to life with a vendetta. But guess the fuck what? The Babylonians AND the Egyptians both knew this shit hundreds of years before he figured it out, and we give him credit? Fuck no Joe, thats a double copy. So, I give him a mathematical applicability/importance rating of \[0\] and a distinguish rating of \[0\]. Now onto his life. Many Greeks considered Pythagoras to be a mystic. He starting a fucking NUMBER CULT in which you would apparently have to swear to five years of silence to be initiated. Now THATS quality cult leading. He also apparently had a thigh made of pure gold. Whether that last one is true or not, I give his life a perfect \[10\]. This gives Pythagoras a total rating of \[3.333....\]. Bet he fucking hates that number. Fuck you Pythagoras try to drown me I dare you copier. &#x200B; **Euclid:** I would absolutely love to see a brawl between Euclid and Riemann over geometry, they could fight in the octagon (sorry). But sadly he was born thousands of years before that. Euclid's axioms are vital in all aspects of geometry and they have held up for thousands of years. Not gonna lie though, I probably could have at least come up with the first one in Kindergarten. And maybe even the 7th one in 4th grade. And maybe the last one fresh out of the womb. But that's beside the point. His axioms and theorems were the foundations for so many aspects of mathematics for thousands of years. Nice work Euclid. For that I give him a contribution rating of a perfect \[10\]. For his distinguish rating, I'm gonna argue that he used Aristotle's process of deduction perfectly and showed how important it is for mathematical theory. For that he gets a \[6\] I guess. I'm only on the second one and I'm already getting lazy so whatever. As for his life, not much is known other than he was a great teacher and did a shit load of math. I'm assuming not much is known about his life because he didnt do a lot of cool shit. So I'm gonna shot in the dark give him a \[3\]. That gives Euclid a \[6.333..\]. Go get him Pythagoras. &#x200B; **Newton:** Lets start with his life. Died a virgin. \[0\]. For his mathematical importance, calculus is pointless. And that dogshit notation? \[0\]. Distinguished? Ha! Stick to physics dipshit. \[0\]. Total: \[0\]. Divide by that you fucking pussy. &#x200B; **Leibniz:** An absolute genius. This man alone discovered calculus totally independently in amazing notation independently. Calculus is an absolutely integral (ha) part in the mathematical world today and revolutionized mathematics forever. For that, I give good ol' Gottfried a perfect \[10\] in mathematical applicability for the wide range of fields and advancements that would proceed his wondrous discoveries. And for the distinguish rating? This math savage didnt stop at discovering calculus. His mathematics would lead to the first ever calculator ever made using the Leibniz wheel, he restructured the binary system which is used in all computer code, and other shit with geometry. That gives him a solid \[8\]. For his life? The guy wound up having 3 wives. That means I bet he had sex at least 3 times, which is a lower bound of 3 more times than that other calculus guy (whats his name again?), so I give him a solid \[8\]. Total:  \[8.67\]. &#x200B; **Euler:** Well, lets start with the obvious. Euler is the most distinguished mathematician of all time. So an obvious \[10\]. First he said fuck it and found a whole ass number literally called 'e' which is short for Euler and is used in the financial industry to the most abstract mathematics out there, and all the way to raves. You cant even do a fucking Fourier transform without Euler just chilling outside the exponent of the integral. Now that is savage. You cant even fucking differentiate the mans last name in exponential form. How many of you can say that? Thought so. \[10\] for contribution rating. And I'm not even done with his contributions yet. He literally has a millennium problem for you ass holes to get 1 million dollars for solving. He did a trivial problem concerning land masses and bridges just for shits and giggles and the math used is implemented for the FOUNDATION OF THE INTERNET. If that doesnt inspire you then go watch a ted talk or something for fucks sake. e\^(pi\*i) + 1 = \[10\] - 10. pi\^2/6. What the fuck else do you need to know about this mathematical genius. His life was pretty boring though other than fucking up a fountain so I give that a \[5\]. Total:  \[8.3333...\]. &#x200B; **Cantor:** \[inf\] &#x200B; Thats it for now. If you want me to do more let me know and I will get drunk again.

aha9hx," Ok, hear me out here for a second: As a former “I’m just not a math person” person, I’d really like to talk about the whole assuming-our-academic-deficiencies are-a-personality-trait thing.  We’ve all heard it 100 times from every non-STEM major in our lives, but as a kid who used to lament my apparently-innately poor math skills, I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately.  I’m become convinced that resenting math is something you learn. Math can be hard, don’t get me wrong. But, in elementary school/primary school we learn from siblings and older friends that math sucks and that it’s so hard and that loads of them around us “just aren’t math people”.  Well, give a kid a hard math assignment, and when he or she gets stuck on a tough problem, they’ve got two options. 1) Realize that a hard problem is a hard problem and requires more personal effort OR 2) Think “Well, just like (friend/sibling/peer), I’m just not that good at math, so it doesn’t matter how long I work at this problem, I just won’t get it”. For an elementary age kid, it’s especially tempting to choose the second option.  We grow up watching older students and siblings and friends talk about how struggling with math is “just how they are” and then, the first time we run into a tough problem, follow their lead and blame it on some innate personality trait. Oh, I’m just not a MATH person. Just like somebody would say, oh, I’m a cat or a dog person.  We see our peers 100% in belief of the fact that you might just inevitably suck at math regardless of personal effort, and that really hard math problem might convince a kid that maybe he falls into that category too, when in reality, it’s just a tough problem.  So we then internalize that there’s just no point even trying, it’s better to accept our fate as inevitably bad at math, because well, hey, isn’t everybody? Took me till college to realize that I was shooting myself in the foot by telling myself I just wasn’t smart enough for STEM, when I know I am, with the major and grades to prove it now. It’s hard to unlearn a personality trait you falsely assign yourself at a young age, but I genuinely think there are a ton of capable young kids out there who are giving up before they even get started.

ayerbj,"I haven't used reddit a lot so please let me know if I did this wrong.   &nbsp;  I work in a Jail, and one of the inmates showed me a curiosity he found while bored in his cell.

Then starting at no particular place he writes 0 &nbsp;  -He then counts 1 space and writes 1  -He then counts 2 spaces and writes 2  -Etc.  &nbsp; All of the pieces of the pie are filled up to 31 and they do not overlap. Interestingly the last piece is opposite the starting position.  He states that it works when the number of sections are multiples of eight.    &nbsp; I've included a picture of his work  https://imgur.com/YWpq9ty  &nbsp; Is there anyone who can explain why this works?

","Imagine that this procedure resulted in you writing two numbers in the same place - call these numbers a and b. How many steps did we take around the circle between writing a and writing b? We took (a+1) + (a+2) + ... + b steps. For those two numbers to be written in the same place, that sum must be a multiple of 32. But if you add up a sequence of consecutive numbers, you never get a power of 2. If you add up an odd number of consecutive numbers, then the result is that odd number times the average, and powers of 2 don't have any odd factors. If you add up an even number of consecutive numbers, then the result is a multiple of the sum of the first and last, which again is odd. So this works because 32 is a power of 2. I doubt it would work for a multiple of 8 which wasn't a power of 2, like 24. (Edit: As pointed out below, this doesn't show that the sum can't be a multiple of 32 with an odd factor. To see that, notice that in either case, we have an odd number times an integer less than 32, and that can't ever be a multiple of 32)",396

bml8fa,"I have always made C's D's and F's in math for as long as I can remember. I can't remember ever passing a single test. I was one of those ""math is scary and hard"" people and would get an impending sense of doom whenever seeing a math problem. I can't express enough how much math-phobia kept me from fulfilling my potential and doing what I wanted to do. Now at 28 years old I made a 93 on the final exam and my final grade for college algebra class will be an A. I took this class 4 times in a row years ago and failed it every time. I know some of you were probably acing college algebra at age 14, but accomplishing this is quite life changing for me. It proves to myself that I can do whatever I set out to do If I put in the work. I told myself ""I'm not stupid, I'm not bad at math, I just need to rebuild my foundation"". So that's what I did, I went back as far as basic multiplication. Fractions. Etc. I did all this before the semester even started. I didn't skip anything I didn't understand. Now I can say something I thought I would never say: math is cool and fun, I like it and I want to do more of it. I'm living proof that if MY dumb ass can turn it around, anyone can. I know it will get  a lot harder from here, but I'm a different person now and am confident in my foundation this time. I feel like the gears have started turning on my ""mathematical thinking"".  Onto trig and then calculus. I'm looking forward to it.","Congratulations! Such an important epiphany for you to have - never forget this feeling. Understanding the very basics on a deep level, even if it means going back to elementary school math, is the single best way to handle higher level math. Keep it up.",301

So it's a nice way to produce ""e"", and also perhaps a simple way to investigate the randomness of primes. Like others have said, it would have been more interesting if the prime example didn't converge to ""e"", because that would diverge from random numbers, providing interest in the primes' distribution. One thing I notice is that the random list has two rows five long, while the prime list has none. Also of interest would be to investigate if the primes take longer to converge to ""e"" than the randoms. It would be nice to get more info on these aspects.

It's true if you generate a sequence of random numbers with random differences, and primes act like those in some ways. Proof: Let (a\_i) be a sequence of random variables whose differences are IID continuous random variables. We calculate the expected length of each row in the above post - a\_0, a\_1, a\_2, and so on, for as long as these differences increase. All rows have at least two entries. The probability of a row having a third entry is 1/2 - this happens when the second difference is larger than the first. The probability of a row having a fourth entry is 1/6 - this happens when the three differences are in increasing order. The probability of a row having a fifth entry is 1/24 - you need four differences in increasing order, and so on. So the expected number of entries in a row is 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/24 + ..., which converges to e.",791
cibara,"Some context: I live in England. I'm 17, going into year 13 in September, and (was) hoping to go to Cambridge to study maths in 2020. However, I attended a subject masterclass at the university this year, and the overwhelming arrogance of the other students there infuriated me. Any time the lecturer would step from one point to the next in an argument, there'd be a chorus of furious nodding from people who really wanted to show just how well they understood that step. The same would come whenever a concept beyond the A-level syllabus was mentioned even in passing, or whenever the lecturer asked who had heard of such-and-such thing before. At one point a guy at the front (who was probably the worst offender on all counts) interrupted the lecturer mid-sentence to explain to everyone a method he knew of proving something that the lecturer was literally in the middle of explaining. During a Q&A session with current Cambridge students, it was very clearly explained that there is no advantage to doing the maths A-level a year early, but you bet that didn't stop one guy from asking whether there was, perchance, an advantage to doing it two years early (wink wink nod nod). This arrogance isn't limited to Cambridge, obviously; it pervades all of mathematics. You need only go on stack exchange to see just how many people are waiting to tell you how dumb you are for not being born knowing that there exist functions that are smooth only at a single point in their domain. It seems every maths person I talk to is just waiting to tell me how many certificates of distinction they've gotten from the British Mathematical Olympiad. I can't stand it! I don't care if you know what a stereographic projection is! I didn't ask! Sorry for the long text post, but I just wanted to talk to somebody about this. I'm also not trying to attack the two people I mentioned above, they just served as good examples.","Annoying teenage overachievers are annoying teenage overachievers. OP, don't worry about it.

While boating, I learned to tie the Bowline, for which there is a simple and popular method which you can find on google and learn in three to four attempts and never get wrong ever again. Armed with my fresh knowledge of topology, I knew that every knot could be rearranged so that any section would become straight and the rest of the knot would change around it. Tying the bowline required three to four movements of the working end, and I surmised that if I could rearrange the knot so that the working end passed straight through the bowline-equivalent structure created in the standing end, then it could be made much more simply and quickly. So I invented a new method of tying the bowline, which required an extremely complicated hand movement to perform, was error-prone, and nigh-impossible to teach... but... you could pass the running end straight through the structure you created on the standing line and then wrestle with it a bit to get it to rearrange back into a bowline... it was a bad idea and a very interesting topological exercise.",300

Brief summary of parts I and II in this paragraph. A few physics collaborators and I stumbled across an interesting linear algebra formula that relates eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It seemed so simple we thought for sure it must be known in the literature, but couldn't find anything. After posting here, you guys directed me to Terry Tao who promptly replied to our email with three proofs. After barely managing to process one proof, we decided to go for it and see if he'd like to write up a paper. I sketched up a draft figuring if we had something that already looked good he'd be more likely to say yes. He promptly replied and said sure (I screamed a little bit), offered a corollary and a few other neat observations. At this point I was two proofs, a corollary, and some other new things behind. I hacked my way through the new information and was about to send a v2 of the draft the next day when he sends another proof (now I'm three proofs behind, oof, I seriously wondered how I would ever catch up with this). At some point during this story, a colleague of mine who straddles physics and math said, “He’s famously like a cheery firehose of mathematics, Guess he’s power-washing you today.” I felt clean. Anyway, I finally caught up and the firehose slowed down a bit. We put the paper online last weekend and it [finally appeared on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03795), along with a new [Terry blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/08/13/eigenvectors-from-eigenvalues/)! I'm so excited you guys don't even know. As for the math, the arXiv paper is barely over two pages so you're best off reading it there or on his blog rather me trying to write formulas here on reddit. Also, as I was typsetting Terry's proofs, I had two files going, one called Math.tex (that ended up being the paper) and another called Physics.tex. The former was basically just what he had sent us slightly reformatted with a few additional notes. The latter described the first proof in enough detail such that I or my physics collaborators could understand it. The latter is about five times as long as the former, heh. Terry has been a pleasure to work with; I learned a ton and he seemed really chill whenever I would say things like, ""I have no idea how this normally works in math but..."" In other news, my Erdos number just went from 4 to 3 where it will probably remain for the rest of my life. **Edit**: Hell, I just got gold for writing a math paper, more than I've gotten for any physics paper I've written. I just need help cashing it out so I can retire.

dop11j,"I just finished writing my bachelor thesis and managed to prove a new theorem for the general case where only the case of 1...4 was known before. This make me so unbelievably happy to not only prove something somewhat useful but also to disprove my teacher. I already showed him the idea behind the proof and he can't find any faults with it. He doubted it was possible to show the general case but I freaking did it! My area is graph theory and my paper was in star edge colouring, a 11 year old area of math so it's not that strange to prove something new in a bachelor thesis.","Since this has got some traction, Here's what I have proven, and I will do my best at explaining it all.     [Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) are the same as networks, so we have a set of vertices (nodes) and a set of edges (connections between nodes). There has been loads of work done in graph theory but just as many conjectures that remain unsolved since the math is pretty complicated and there's a lot of tools we need that aren't available yet.    My thesis is about *star edge colourings*, which is defined as indexing the edges such that no path of length four or more use only two indexes and no two edges adjacent to each other using the same index. For example, if we index the edges with colours, we can't have a path with (Red, Blue, Red, Blue) or (Red, Red, Blue) but (Red, Blue, Green, Red, Blue, Green) or (Red, Blue, Green, Blue, Red) is allowed. Now, finding a colour palette that works is easy, assign a unique index to every edge. What's difficult (NP-hard) is finding the least number of colours needed, which is called the star edge chromatic index.    There is also something called [bipartite graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph), which is defined as a graph where you can partition the vertices into two(bi) parts, so there is no edge that connects two vertices in the same part. Examples include matching boxes to items or data to pointers. What I have proven, is that for a bipartite graph B with maximum degree k, i.e. the number of neighbours to the vertex with the most neighbours, the star edge chromatic index is less than k2-k+1 for all k greater than 1.    Before my work, it was known that the star edge chromatic index for maximum degree 1,2,3 and 4 were at most 1,3,7 and 13, respectively.   There is still no application for star edge colourings, but since it's maths, it might be used in 150 years and that's enough for me.",534

Most of the math teachers at my school don’t even know how to solve the problems they give to students! However, in freshman year, I read my math 1 textbook and found it very interesting. I then just searched up “math” on reddit and found you guys! All the amazing posts made me even more interested in math. Then, I went to the list of free math learning resources you guys have, which is where I found Khan Academy (I know Khan Academy is super common in other places but no one knows of it in my town). I discovered that list in the middle of freshman year. So in my second semester of freshman year, I went through all of lower level math courses, Calculus AB/BC, and Statistics. Since then, I have been using that list to help me learn more math. I have used all the resources on your list and they are all really useful (Khan Academy taught me how to apply to colleges!). This subreddit has helped me grow a passion for math and education when I didn’t have the support or resources myself. This year, I am a graduating senior. I have applied to many colleges and have already been accepted to ucla, ucsb, uci early for their various honors things. Thank you so much for providing a place for me to foster passion and knowledge! I’m so excited for what the future holds for me in math :)","ucla! i go there, and i love math here :)",210
fkqyjz,"Ever since I started high school, I’ve been hemming and hawing about what to do with my life. When I took Calc 1 in my junior year, I learned that, whatever I did do in the future, I wanted to learn more math. I kept with it as a hobby into my first year in college, to the confusion of my advisors. I didn’t need any more math for my major, and the classes wouldn’t count towards my degree. I just smiled sheepishly and said that it’s just something I wanted to do. Thanks to you guys on this sub, I’ve realized that I have a passion for learning math I have to follow no matter what. Plus, lurking on the career section showed me that getting a math degree isn’t useless, like I previously thought.  This is a pretty massive overhaul in my life, and I just want to thank you guys for unknowingly giving me the courage to switch my major to math :) Edit: thank you so much for the warm welcome! Many of you guys have offered advice for continuing my major as well as job hunting, which is much appreciated. Several people have also pointed me to topics I might be interested in and some resources to check out people/talks/YouTube channels/etc. I’ve already started pawing through these recommendations—and my god, there is so much to learn! :D thank you all again!

gc4hb6,"I am at a loss. I really am, and if anyone has any comments on this I'd truly appreciate them. I am a doing a PhD in maths, having completed a masters degree in pure mathematics, with focus on logic. I then moved abroad to start a PhD program (fully funded), and have been here for 18 months now. Honestly, I don't know any maths anymore. I actually wonder whether I ever knew much maths in the first place. It feels like I have to relearn so many things I used to know. I feel like I need to catch up with invisible competitors. I sometimes scroll through math stack exchange, and realise how few questions I could answer -- and I'm working towards a freaking PhD! How pathetic is that. My supervisor wants me to focus on research questions, but I can hardly concentrate on the problems he gives me. I spend much more time looking at other maths I know I used to know, then scold myself for not remembering, then reading around a little to remind myself, just to eventually give in and pity myself. I don't know how to work myself out of this hole. My supervisor and the department seem happy with what I'm doing (just had my proposal passed), but what does that matter if I don't believe in myself? At this point (the quarantine doesn't help either, by the way), I don't feel like I know anything, and I'm just wasting their time. Finally, and that's the worst part about this all, I don't actually enjoy doing maths right now because of the headspace I'm in. If I remember how to do something, then I put it off, not as a success but as formality because I should know it anyway -- if I don't, the day is basically ruined. I guess something's fundamentally wrong here, so if anyone has any input to give me I'd really appreciate it. Hope you're all safe and doing well. &#x200B; EDIT: I am truly touched by all your thoughtful responses and encouraging words. Thank you so much for your support.  Please know that I’m reading each and every single one of your messages. Quite a few of your words have led me to think deeply about myself in ways fundamentally different from what I’m used to — I am stuck in my own toughts, and your perspectives have given me so much. I would have never thought that my post would receive so much feedback, especially not from quite a few of you who feel similarly. I hope things work out well for all of you, I’ll keep my fingers crossed.","You know more than you may realize. I was in the same position, but what changed my perspective is when I prepared and gave my first talk. It's crazy how we forget how much stuff we know. But when you have to present it in an hour, you quickly realize that there is a lot to explain and it's almost impossible to fit all of it in a single talk. Moreover, it's easy to think that everything you know is trivial and known to everybody, but it's not. The few questions and conversations I got after my first talk made me realize that.",658

Michael does a great job with his videos, they have a  serious demeanor and progress at a great pace. I highly recommend watching them.","Really great channel.

jfjje7,"Whenever I talk to people about mathematics, it seems like everyone feels absolutely hopeless. Despite the success of channels like Numberphile and 3blue1brown, there's still a prevailing attitude of ""well, that kid I saw on TV the other day can do advanced calculus on the fly, why should I even bother looking into something I'm clearly never going to be good at"". The more I think about it, the sadder it is, because mathematics is arguably the most powerful tool in existence. Seeing it subjugated to this ruthlessly competitive framework (should be noted, I'm talking about primary to high school level math here, once you get into academia, competition is obviously vital). Sort of echoing Lockhart's famous essay here, but imagine if we discouraged people from creating music, experimenting with completely new sounds and ideas, finding totally ways of simplifying complicated ideas, and decided that everyone (even potentially) interested in music has to endure a grueling process akin to the movie ""Whiplash"". I'm sorry if this post came across as incoherent rambling, it's just such a shame that mathematics still struggles with this image of being relegated to the select few, while everyone else shouldn't even try to discover its hidden beauty.","There's also the notion that math is a solitary practice when in reality it can often be collaborative.

k3ia4q,"Hey all - recently I took a deep dive into the SVD/PCA.  My goal was to understand the math with confidence, and then use it for something interesting.  In my project, NumPy's svd function does the hard work, but even still, just using it challenged my understanding in instructive ways.  Between my study and the project, I feel I truly understand, mathematically, what the SVD does and why it works.  Finally.  Feels good. Anyway, my project was to calculate the Eigen Grandito, which is named after the Onion article, ""Taco Bell's Five Ingredients Combined In Totally New Way"", which, in more mathematical terms, asserts that Taco Bell's dishes are all linear combinations of the same ingredients.   And so the Eigen Grandito ""recipe"" is just the first principle component of the matrix of Taco Bell dishes and their ingredients.  In theory, the Eign Grandito is the ""most Taco Bell"" of Taco Bell dishes.   Here is a link to my code and the results: http://www.limerent.com/projects/2020_11_EigenGrandito/ Any feedback and corrections are welcome.  I would love to know if I've made any mistakes.

I should absolutely understand the geometrical and “physical” meaning of the cross products of two vectors.

Particularly with the product of an angular velocity x a position vector. How you’re basically just multiplying the magnitude of the ang vel by the radius created from the part of the position vec which is perpendicular to the axis of rotation. I can see the sorta 2-d projection and understand the calculation that way now. WOW!!!! I have struggled with this since the start of undergrad. Maybe goes to show that engineering undergrad linear algebra is not taught with a focus on intuition, or that I didn’t study with a focus on understanding. Regardless. Yay.

mttltg,"There’s this idea in the air that you’re either a math person or you’re not; moreover, people often assume that you have to be very intelligent to do math. While there is a lot of intelligent people in mathematics I’m certain that a lot of people who think that they’re not smart enough for math or people who have failed a math class(and as a result think they’re not a math person) can definitely grow into a math person and be competitive in a school setting and end up even getting a PHD in math. Growing into a math person is a process so it won’t happen over night but if you have the interest and willingness to devote your time studying mathematics and working hard at it you will grow into a math person. I think the first step is getting interested in the subject. I personally got interested in Math by for example reading “A Character of Physical Law” by Richard Feynman. In this book he says that to be able to appreciate nature you have to know mathematics. So this was one of the things I found interesting and got me curious. Another good book that got me going in math is “A Mathematicians Delight” by Sawyer. So the idea is to start with high school algebra(if you’re really new to this). Try to master this subject. In reality you only need a subset. Do a lot of exercises and you will master it. You’ll get confidence to study trig and then calculus and so on until you get to upper level university math(eg topology, differential geometry). You can be a math person too.

mzpz1e,"  Hello, everyone. I found out last night that my high school math teacher, whom I had for Pre-Calculus and AP Calculus BC, was killed yesterday in a tragic accident. I won’t go into too many details to preserve his privacy, but I would like to share what he meant to me and my math journey. As a child, I was ‘bad at math.’ I’m not sure where that began, but by the time I was in middle school, being bad at math was part of my identity. I was the butt of many jokes because I couldn’t add fractions or draw a graph. I hated math with a passion and often didn’t do my homework out of spite. I passed, but only because I was desperate to be done with math as soon as possible. My high school required Pre-Calculus for graduation, so I stumbled in there in 11th grade with the expectation that it would be painful, but my last mathematical punishment. This particular math teacher taught my class the second semester. He brought a new approach, focused not on lecture and formula memorization but on derivations, proofs, and problem solving. He talked about ‘intuition,’ which I had never thought would apply to math. Something about his manner and style made me care. I liked him as a person, so I wanted him to see me try. I stayed after class one day to ask about a problem I’d gotten wrong on a problem set, and we ended up filling the wall-to-wall whiteboards for 3 hours after the school day ended. We drifted from limits to derivatives to Newton’s laws and the origins of calculus, and somehow, *I followed along.* For the first time in my life, I saw math and was *excited.* Staying after class, or through the lunch hour, or arriving early in the morning became routine for me. I loved it. My grades shot from passing marks to consistent As. I looked forward to Pre-Calc all day. By the end of that single semester, I went from not understanding the unit circle to being confident doing derivatives. When I found out that this teacher was teaching AP Calc BC the next year, I rearranged my entire class schedule away from the humanities towards STEM classes. My education finally excited me. He wrote my recommendation letter when I applied to college, and I got into a great school where I’m now pursuing a physics and economics double-major with plans to go for a PhD. in physics after I graduate. Without him, I never would have found the fields that I love and I never would have stopped doubting my intelligence. He believed in and supported me when I didn’t think I deserved it, and altered the course of my education and career for the better. I couldn’t be more grateful. Thank you for reading such a long post. I want to celebrate a fantastic teacher who died far too soon. To all math teachers dedicated to their students: you are invaluable and can truly change lives. I regret not being able to tell my math teacher how much I appreciate his work. He taught me so much about math and beyond, and I don’t know how to honour him properly.",Maybe you can share this story with a family member of him (wife?). I am sure they would appreciate it a lot to hear that he had such a good influence on his students.,293
ngzk4b,"When I’m teaching an upper division undergraduate or a graduate course in mathematics, well, I don’t know everything. Sometimes there are problems that have eluded me since undergrad or I might be teaching a class I never formally took while in school. And sometimes, I will throw one of those problems into my homework assignments. Most of the motivation is to force myself to give the problem some serious thought, and other times, I just want to see how my students approach a problem that is especially difficult. All but once, I’ve been able to actually solve the problem before it came up, and I don’t grade those particular problems very harshly. Usually, I give points to those who at least gave it a shot, and more points when they actually tried something that was somewhat credible. Am I the only one that does this? It does add a bit of a thrill back to a subject, where I know I will face a bunch of grumpy students, if I can’t solve it.","Not uncommon. I once had an undergraduate oral exam which started with a problem whose solution neither the professor nor the postdoc writing the protocol knew. It then derailed into the three of us trying to crack the problem for the entire hour of the exam, after which we concluded that the shit is hard. Also, a friend of mine was asked to proof the Poincare conjecture in the oral exam of the beginners topology lecture in year 1.",634
nlpjfa,"Let 'A' be a coefficient to ""le"", and 'c' be an exponent.  So I can rewrite it as A(le)^c. Using the power rule for derivatives, I can write it as cA(le)^(c-1), and I can fudge ""c-1"" to be 'b'.  Therefore, the mathematical derivative of Alec, as well as my biological derivative in the form of a son, would be cA(le)^b aka Caleb. Is this dumb? My fiance is honestly down to do this with me haha.","It would be really funny if you didn’t tell your son for like ten years and then showed them the, by this point very old, Reddit post and be like “look the title you may use for the rest of you life originates from a slightly dodgy math joke!” Caleb is a nice name I think it’s a fun idea XD",564
npuy8k,"Alan Turing's Birthday is on the 23rd of June. We're going to make it special. Every year, people from Reddit pledge bunches  of flowers to be placed at Alan Turing's statue in Manchester for his  birthday. In the process we raise money for the amazing charity [Special Effect](https://www.specialeffect.org.uk/), which helps people with disabilities access computer games. Since 2013 we've raised about £7600 doing this, and we'd like 2021 to  be our biggest year ever. Anyone who wants to get involved is welcome.  Donations are made up of £3.50 to cover the cost of your flowers and a  £14 charity contribution to Special Effect for a total of £17.50. Manchester city council have confirmed they are fine with it, and we  have people in Manchester who will help handle the set up and clean up. To find out more and to donate, click [here](https://equalitytime.github.io/FlowersForTuring/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_content=UnitedKingdom).

nqffrr,"I don't mean abusing math to make some political/religious/metaphysics argument, believe me I've seen some pretty stupid stuff... I mean fun stupid, like Ignoble prize worthy stuff. My favorite example, though I don't fully understand the math, is using the Thue-Morse Sequence to balance the caffeination (and concentration of flavor compounds*) of pours of coffee.  Basically, in a drip coffee machine, your brew gets weaker as it gets made (on account of, primarily, the initial extraction taking more time to saturate the bed of grounds before gravity overcomes surface tension) so if you pour your cups in typical sequence they get stronger with each cup (weakest coffee brews last, thus is on the top, thus is served first). However, if you desire greater consistency in caffeination, you can choose to make alternating pours between two cups according to the Thue-Morse Sequence and they'll be roughly equivalent.
