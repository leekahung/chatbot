13rvnp,"(for those who arent aware: http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/137owz/my_wife_makes_me_wear_a_chastity_and_its_not_for/ ) So, my wife got back on Monday and she was off for a week. Tomorrow she is heading out again. She told me to put it on tonight but I told her no, sorry. She huffed and puffed and threatened me, then yelled at me, then cried... I told her I smashed both devices with a hammer and now she's at her sisters house and refuses to come home. She's going to have to just deal with it. I have a list of therapists and a lawyer on stand-by. I'm a happy man and staying strong. I just wanted to give you all a follow up. I did take your advice. Thank you /r/confession !!!","The nature of your relationship is about to change. Maybe it's over, maybe it will improve, but the important part is that a man can't live without dignity, and what she was forcing you to do was demeaning and cruel.

I've been reading your Reddit posts since you were a sophomore in high school.  I know you think I don't even know what Reddit is; I may be over 50, but as you are learning, parents aren't really that oblivious. That secret Santa gift you received years ago, that you thought I didn't notice, showed your account name.  Ever since I watched your account.  So when I saw some comment about being down or unhappy, Mom and I tried harder to make sure you knew we loved you and were sure everything would work out. Teenage years can be tough.  I'm proud of what you have accomplished and see the mature, confident, capable young man you've become.  So, no need to change your account name now, I don't feel the need to watch over you in the same way I did years ago and I promise to stop reading your posts.","I put keylogging software on my computer (the only one that was used to surf the net at the time) and told both my kids straight up that I'd be looking stuff over. I also let them know that as long as it wasn't illegal or dangerous I'd probably let it slide. Here's how it went. 1. I ignored any porn. Don't care. My (then) 12 year old son looked at boobs? Oh noes! 2. I found my daughter sending and receiving texts with obviously adult males. Yes, they were grooming and asking to meet. I shut that shit down fast. 3. My daughter tried to be dramatic about how bad her home life  was and she started lying and telling tales about abuse. That also got shut down fairly quickly. Once they reached a certain age I stopped even looking at what they were doing online. By then they'd had the talk about online dangers and thought through their actions. I still say the keylogger and communication was a good thing and both of my kids agree.",3075
60b51v,"I know that it is wrong to feel this way but still, [No Regrets]. This 17 year old blonde white girl went missing after she drunkenly crashed her car into another car and then literally ran away from the scene. She had passengers in her car that were unconscious and bleeding profusely and she abandoned them without a second thought. The other car was a family with children and, again, this girl took off running to avoid being in trouble for a DUI. Here is where I get pissed off: literally everyone in the community rushed to form a search party and is obsessively ""sending prayers for her"" and giving donations to her family. Why? She did literally the same thing that that ""affluenza teen"" Ethan Couch did and we all hate him for it! She sounds like a really shitty person to do what she did. She abandoned her critically injured friends and seriously injured family in the other car, and took off running from an accident she caused while drunk just to avoid being in trouble. Fuck this girl. I don't feel like she deserves all our donations and ""love and support"" it just seems ridiculous to me.  When we see a black teenager on the news that gets shot while stealing candy or something, and people say ""well they shouldn't have been breaking the law and they wouldn't have been killed"" but suddenly this girl gets trashed drunk and drives into a car with a family inside, peaces out from the accident scene and we should all be sending her money and ""praying for her safe return?""

63qi1f,"One night when I was 13/14 my grandmother had come to visit us. She slept in my bed and I slept on the couch. At this point in my life, pretty much every night I would wait for everyone to go to sleep and then I would jack off. Even though I was on the couch, I still decided to do it. For some reason, in my horned-up state, I got really turned on by the idea of ejaculating on my grandmother's face. So, without really thinking, I went into my room and while she was still asleep I quietly jacked off next to her and then finished on her cheek/neck area.  After I finished I left as quickly and quietly as I could and went back to the lougeroom. I have no idea if she knows what I did. This happened a decade ago and I still hate myself every time I think about it. I don't know what I was thinking. [Remorse]",This is the most fucked up thing I've read on the internet in years.,9331

6anvzn,"I have a fiancee that my parents would certainly not approve of, and it's being tearing me apart for the last year and a half. I met my fiancee two and half years ago, and tomorrow will be our 2 year anniversary together. We're planning on getting married this August. I couldn't be happier with her. She's funny, smart, loyal, she loves to me to death, and I feel it everyday, and on top of all of that, the best bonus any guy can ask for, she's absolutely amazing in bed. The problem? My parents and I are Chinese immigrants. My mom and dad have a strong dislike for black people. My fiancee is black, and she's an immigrant herself, from Ethiopia. For the past 2 years, my parents have being trying to introduce me to various Chinese women and obviously, since I've brushed off all of their friend's daughters, they're starting to even suspect maybe I'm gay and don't like women.  They've spent tens of thousands of dollars to put me through school, they paid for my living expense during my 5 years of college, not to mention raising me into an adult. Now that I have a good job, an amazing girlfriend, and ready to move on in life, I fear tomorrow will be the end of our family. There is no way I'm going to give up on my fiancee, I can't see myself growing old with anyone else besides her.  Big day tomorrow, wish me luck. [No Regrets] **UPDATE**: Wow, I never expected this post to get this much attention. For those wanting an update, the talk went a bit better than I expected. I showed my parents pictures of my girlfriend and they were slightly disappointed. No yelling, no angry lectures like I expected. I can finally get good nights of sleep after months of insomnia stressing out over this. I'm so glad this is over. The good parts: 1. They said they're willing to accept my girlfriend because although her skin is dark, her facial features look more like a white girl than black. I know it's really racist, but at this point, I'm just so glad they're willing to accept her, I'm not gonna argue or make any comment to them about this. 2. They're happy that she's a pharmacist. So career wise, it's another +1.  3. They think she's actually pretty good looking, minus the dark skin obviously. Again, if any of this was said by anyone besides my parents, whom I'm desperately trying to convince to accept my girlfriend, I would not be so accepting. 4. I will be bringing her to meet my parents the day after tomorrow, this Sunday. I can't wait for this to happen. I've been dreaming about this day for a long time. The bad: This one was kinda my fault, they're not happy with the fact that I kept her a secret from them for 2 years. I did not tell them we're getting married in 3 months, I figured it's a little too much to take all at once, so I'll let them know in a month or so.","You're not financially dependent on them or living with them, are you?

6c2lwt,"I know that some people will think it's wrong but I don't know how else to handle this situation. Ever since my first child was born I've done my best to create an open environment where my children able to talk to me about anything, free of judgement (for the most part). Sex, drugs, alcohol, whatever. I wanted them to be able to come to me if they ever had a problem. Now to the point of the post: Ever since my daughter started at university she has been sleeping around a lot. In the last year she has had sex with at least 13 different guys and that's just the one's that I know about. On top of that she often goes out to parties and doesn't come home until the next day so it's likely much more than that. I've tried to talk to her about it but she just tells me to stay out of her life and stop judging her. It came to a head yesterday morning when I went into her room to find her asleep in her bed, naked, with *two* guys. I've tried so hard to be tolerant of whatever she wants to do but I will not have my daughter acting this way; certainly not in my house. I told her to pack her bags and move out - I don't care where. Maybe it makes me a bad dad but she is an adult now. If she wants to act this way then she can pay her own way.

6hy9bf,"[Remorse] Every year on Father's Day I put on a brave face and go to work. I talk on the radio all day to people I don't know and who will never see me and often they will wish me a Happy Father's Day as a pleasantry when I ship them to the next frequency. I know they mean well and I'm gracious to them and thank them, but it cuts me to the core.  Most of my coworkers are male and many of them have young kids of their own. They show up to work with the silly crowns, stickers, cards, and mugs that their kids made for them at school on Friday. I'm not mad about that and I don't fault them for wearing them...that's what dads are supposed to do when they have kids they love and who love them back. I loved my daughter and I still love her but she's gone and she can't love me back and it hurts.  I don't want to hear commercials about Father's Day on the radio when I'm driving to work or home from work tomorrow. I don't want to have an internal argument with myself about how I ""should"" feel on Father's Day and whether not I'm ""really"" a father. I don't want my coworkers who know my story to awkwardly avoid talking to me all day and elbow someone who doesn't know my story when he brings out a picture of his kids to share with us. I don't want people to tread lightly around me...my pain should not affect their happiness. I don't want that--but I also don't want it to still hurt like it does. Most of all, I don't want to come home to this empty house after work like I've done every day since my wife left 3 years ago. What I do want is my family back.  My daughter was just a toddler. She never even got a chance.  Dads--please hug your kids today...and every day after today too. Happy Father's Day. ","Thank you for sharing this.

What's worse, is that she does this in the presence of her 3 year old daughter.   I'm going to list my reasons for concern here:   • She smokes copious amounts of marijuana daily • Her daughter is fed a diet of takeaway food  • Her daughter is rarely put to bed before midnight  • Her daughter is always treated unfairly   One day they broke up, she threatened to kill herself in her car, with her 3 year old daughter sat beside her. My friend rushed to the house to find her daughter in tears, scratch marks down her face. His girlfriend was sat on her bed with open cuts down her arms. For me, this was the final straw.

71jdm7,"I'm sorry but this is a long read. While I was in college I was paired with a very peculiar roomate. She didn't talk to me much and would always be away, she was very clean and organized and I thanked the heavens for it because all my friends complained about their roomates and I had gotten lucky. Jump to two years later, she comes up to me to say that she's pregnant and may need some help from me. I asked who was the father but she said it was a random guy she hooked up with and she couldn't even find him anymore. When I asked about her family she said that she didn't have one, her entire family was dead and she had been on foster homes most of her life and only got out because she wasn't underage anymore. After that talk she didn't say anything else. I noticed that she had strange patterns, she would wake up and leave super early and get back super late. The only times she asked me for my help while pregnant was when she went to discover the sex of the baby and to accompany her to one appointment who was a bit away from campus. Even then we didn't talk much. She kept her routine and I kept mine. Sure she was pregnant but she acted like she wasn't and to be honest there wasn't much I could do anyway. She didn't slow down even when she got near her the end of the pregnancy and I'm sure this played a huge part on how things ended. She was 7 months pregnant and asked me to take her to the doctor because she was feeling a lot of pain. She was weird during the entire ride, talking nonsense. She said she wanted me to care for the baby and to never tell the baby about her. At this point I was freaking out, this wasn't supposed to happen, so I was just agreeing to whatever she was saying. When we got to the hospital they took her straight to be examined and later to have a c-section. Apparently she had preeclampsia and her placenta was detached. At this point I called a few friends of mine because I was freaking out. The doctors gave me some medicine because my blood pressure was very high and I was having a panic attack. I don't remember that part but that's what they told my friends when they got there.  Later I learned that my roomate had died because of the birth but the kid was alive. They said that they had found a note on her belongings saying that I was the one who was supposed to care for the kid because she had no one else and didn't want her daughter to be raised by strangers like she was.  I was so confused at the time, they said they would have to contact child services and I would have to file for adoption. This was at a weird time or maybe the city was just messed up, because they only checked my background and if I had a job and a place to fall back on and that was that. They just gave me a baby and didn't think twice about it because apparently the note that the roomate had left was a big thing and should be taken into account. They gave me the note to read and I wasn't supposed to ever tell the kid about her real mom. After a lot of time thinking I came up with the idea to investigate her alongside my friends, which wasn't much since we were a bunch of idiots in college with not a lot of money. We could only find out that she was a sex worker and that nobody knew her much around college aside from a girl who was also a sex worker and gave us the info. My friends told me to make up a pregnancy and have my parents care for the kid while I was in college. I'm not sure my parents ever bought the whole story but they did love the kid and accepted to care for her. The story was basically me getting pregnant on accident and not telling them because I was ashamed but coming back around because I realized that I needed help. 19 years later I'm married with two kids who are mine and my daughter who is mine but not by blood. I love all of them equally, I learned a lot after I graduated and had to care for her with the help of my parents. She is a bright kid and looks a lot like her mother, which makes me sad sometimes. She even says that we don't look alike and I tell her she took after her ""father"". I really wish I could tell her the truth. I feel so bad not doing it.

We spent 4 months in therapy and I was certain we were making progress, but he suddenly relapsed to his old, super quiet, stress ridden, mentally crippled self. His mother lashed out at me calling me a line of names and profanities, saying that they wasted money and time, and is now taking him to see someone else.

He still knows what he learned with you, and that will never go away. Recovery is often a two steps forward, one step back process and whatever triggered his relapse isn't your fault.   It's unfortunate that his mother disrupted the work you were doing. I think it probably would have been better for him to stay with someone he knew and trusted enough to have a nickname for. But since he's in therapy so young, I think there's a great chance he'll work through everything and have a happy life, even if (sadly) you don't get to see it.  We also have to have a lot of empathy for his poor mother. Grief and concern about your child will often lead you to do irrational, destructive things.

76a5ex,"My wife and I had been trying for a couple of years to have our own kids, but found out we could not.  So, we went the way we had talked about many times before, and went through adoption.  Because, hey, every kid needs a home, right? That's when we came across our now adopted son, Nate (names changed, of course).  Nate was the bastard son of a whore of a mom who fucked who she could for drugs, money, etc.  His bio father had some sense and convinced mom to put all three of her kids (Nate was the only one of his, the other two -- a brother and sister -- were from unknown / different fathers).  She agreed.  And that was when Nate was about 6.  He was technically removed due to deplorable living conditions and abuse, but she didn't fight to keep him. We met him for the first time last year.  I was sketchy on him.  He appeared to have ADHD.  Not a deal breaker, but wouldn't have been my first choice.  He never looked at us, jumped up and ran around the restaurant we met at, and had a hard time focusing.  Hell, he's a 9 year old kid.  Kids have a hard time sitting still, and get nervous.  ((I figured)). My wife fell in love with him (I was still sketchy, but we *had* met other kids, so he wasn't our first choice at the time).  We started getting more info on him, planned on meeting him more, etc.  It was a learning curve. We took him to Chuck E Cheese, just to hang with him for a day.  He was ALL over the place.  Eh, kids.  No biggie. We started finding out more from the foster parents (who we didn't care for -- they seemed to be brainwashing their kids, and seemed to be in it for the money).  Nothing major, but I was still being cautious.  We figured maybe he had either ADHD or some high functioning Autism.  Again, not a deal breaker, but it was something I'm not used to.  My wife had experience (volunteer and career) with special needs children.  He seemed to be growing on us.  Called us mom and dad once, we started having fun together, it seemed to be a good fit. We noticed (closer to the day we took him home for 6 months before finalizing the adoption) he had ""addictions"".  Mostly videogames.  Not too unusual, again, he's a kid.  Kids are supposed to love videogames.  Fuck, we both like them.  Why not?  But he became aggressive.  Like, wouldn't listen to you and if you turn them off or threaten to take them away, he'd become violent to throwing the controller, kicking a chair, etc.  We nipped that in the ass as soon as possible, limiting him and explaining why.  (We eventually took it away altogether -- may be explained later.) He saw a therapist / psychologist / optometrist / general physician / and several other professionals.  One diagnosed him with ADHD.  Another thought Autism.  Another thought Reactive Attachment Disorder.  All seemed... less than great.  But we're attached.  We'd get through this. That was about a year ago now.   Ever since then, at least every other day (if not every day), we have had to put him in restraints (all okay per DHS, his therapist, and others).  We've had to get onto him.  We've tried different reward systems.  We've tried starting nice / second chances.  We've tried everything we can think of.  Fuck, even trying to show unconditional love (when we feel nearly defeated). He's constantly lying about everything and anything, he plays dumb, he threatens to be ""bad"" (which we aren't afraid of -- we've shown him many times we're not afraid of him), he breaks things, he has no emotions, anything.  Never shows remorse (unless he's told to; ""Tell them you're sorry!"").  Does what he wants, even when he knows it's going to get things taken away.  He's tried (and somewhat succeeded) to hurt his dog, several times, because he ""wants to see how it feels pain"".  He's been pure Hell.  He ""understands"", but doesn't care (from what we can tell). Just tonight, we had a date night, and dropped him off to a ""parent's night out"" group at the local Y.  We had a great time, just being able to be ourselves. We get back, I go in to pick him up.  The assistants there pull me aside and tell me he was caught trying to (well, not so much trying -- he DID) grab several girls' privates.  Twice.  That was all the info I needed.  I grabbed him, a bit embarrassed, brought him to the car and had him explain to my wife what happened.  Of course, we've been talking to him for several hours now, explaining why that was bad, etc.  But, again, he shows no remorse and just makes up excuse after excuse.  Long story short, he wanted to, and so he did. After everything we've been through...  I honestly regret adopting him. I don't know if I'd adopt again if given the chance.  Even if given the chance to go back in time and change my mind on him and switch to another kid, I don't think I would.  ~~I'd~~  We'd be much happier without him, or any other child in our home. I wish Nate had never come into our lives.  And I'm pretty much sure my wife wishes the same thing. **TL;DR** This motherfucker we adopted has got to be fucking crazy.  No other explanation.  ","Wow - that is a lot...he sounds borderline sociopathic/psychopathic possibly (lack of empathy, hurting animals, sexually forward, lying and violent tantrums)...that can happen sometimes especially with older adopted kids where all they experienced from birth is abuse and emotional detachment...they themselves detach early on and its nearly impossible to switch them back on to where they can have empathy and people skills that extend beyond his own wishes. Has he ever cried??  I'd see a therapist in child behavior about this..he may require some strong meds and therapy meetings. Don't be discouraged in adoptions..not everyone of them is broken..I believe fully in adoption and applaud your brave determination. It can get trying - hang in there.  ",1121
76gncm,"[No Regrets] I was in high school, it was the late 80s. I was emancipated already, so I had my own apartment. I also had pay channels because the landlord had a package deal that included my Tv.  A guy started really hitting on me, whom I really rather liked. It didn't dawn on me that he had only started doing so *after* I got my own apartment (which meant time away from his restrictive home environment for him).  Well, he started spending time at my house, then he started bringing his friends to watch my pay channels with him and ignoring me... The first time they ate my food, I had cooked myself some crockpot chili for the entire week. It was literally all my meals for the week, to be divvied up into the freezer and eaten as needed. I asked nicely for them not to do it again and explained clearly that it was all my food for the week. They did it again the next weekend when I made myself a lasagna.... and this time I yelled at them. My erstwhile 'boyfriend' then slapped me and told me to knock it off (I was interrupting their show, you know). I was rather outraged that not one guy, not *one* so much as batted an eye about it. Instead of breaking up with him immediately, though, I hatched a plot... I bought two cans of alpo wet dog food and a bag of egg noodles. I made ""goulash"" with it in the crockpot and let them eat it.  After that, I brought the landlord's dog up. I carefully let him lick each and every bowl (because, of course, they didn't wash their dishes after they stole my food, either). I placed them into the cabinet as nonchalantly as I could, pretending this was how I always did dishes. I then answered their question about ""what was the recipe"" of my ""delicious"" food.... and placed the two open cans of Alpo on the table. Needless to say, they never came back. I took great relish in spreading it around school that they not only ate literal dog food--but they loved it enough to want the recipe. Edit: TL;DR My ""boyfriend"" and his buddies ate my food twice. When I objected, he slapped me. So I fed them dog food.",Assholes deserved it. And I hope your boyfriend didn't hit you after you told him about the food.,1890
787zzs,"When we first adopted him, we had no idea that our cat was going to grow up to a 31” long, 23 pound beast, so his name quickly was changed to Bubba.  Bubba was an aggressive cuddler.  Any time you were reading a book, he would come over and plant himself directly between your head and your book. Several years before he died, there was a night where my wife and I were lying in bed.  I honestly have no idea what I ate that day, but I had a case of particularly noxious gas.  I happened let a silent one go right as Bubba jumped up on the foot of the bed.  He walked up to the head of the bed, every step he took helped push the fumes out towards the top of the covers.  He reached the pillows and decided to curl up right between my wife and I, with his butt conveniently pointed towards her.  It was then that the fumes got out and my wife instinctively blamed Bubba.  She grabbed him off the bed, ejected him from the room, and closed the door.  As she spent the next couple minutes complaining about the cat, I couldn’t say anything.  It was all I could do to keep from laughing about the cat getting the blame. 2 years ago Bubba died of a heart attack.  He was walking across the family room and fell over dead instantly.

78hd6f, EDIT: THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR WORDS OF KINDNESS AND ENCOURAGEMENT!!!! These comments have brought tears to my eyes. These comments have further encouraged me in my road to kicking booze for good. I feel so much love from you internet strangers and for that I love you all!!! I don't know if there is a higher power out there but I am blessed to see how much better and happier life is when you're sober. I used booze and weed to null my pain but the truth was that they were main contributors to it. My goal is to meditate or workout any time I get a craving and also pick up new hobbies like Jiu Jitsu and yoga. I also bought a ukulele to occupy my time and focus on a new hobbie to distract myself from cravings. You're all such beautiful people and I'd never expect this much positivity from Reddit. I love you all <3,"Everyone saying ""good for you"" are probably those people with positive well meaning intentions, but no actual clue what they're on about. Going a week without intoxicates is great for an exercise in asceticism. It's not a way to stay clean. There's only one tried and true method for staying clean and sober. It's community. If no one knows you have a problem, then you're never going to get better, because the power of recovery comes from the support of others. We do drugs because drugs help us regulate our emotions. But humans aren't drug animals, we're social animals. It's our real life social network that keeps us stable, friends, family, work, purpose. I'm sure you feel like you're making progress, and you are, don't let me take that from you. But it's like flying a plane and trying to land it without wheels. You've made it from one place to another, but people are what help stop you from crashing and burning. If that makes sense. Stay strong, stay wise.",74

I felt like I missed out on the fundamentals of highschool love, especially since I'd been looking forward to it.  I also however needed some money for school, and really was just craving any sense of excitement in my life. I went to this random as website that's similar to Craigslist and made a post about my virginity with pictures , and instructions on how my fantasy went. And then  set the bids at 1,500 and the bids reached 10,200, it was so weird the amount of guys who just have money like that.  Anyways the guy who had the highest bid was 50 and owned some sort of business Im the trades not sure what. He wasn't ugly, he was actually decently attractive but then again I was into older guys so I'm biased. We set up a date and he took me to a nice hotel, bought me a dress, we went to dinner, and when we came back there was flowers, chocolates, and a present for me in the room. And rose petals on the bed and candles lit, all like I imagined since the 8th grade.  We had sex it was okay I mean I had nothing to compare it too at the time it felt amazing. but the best part was after since he made me feel comfortable, and we just talked all night and cuddled and made out.i left the next morning and that was that.

You go home at the end of the day; you're not stuck in a hospital with nothing to do. They provide psychiatrists that you meet with at least once a week to manage your meds and an individual therapist to help guide your experience. These last as long as your insurance covers which I believe is usually around a few weeks. They will teach you skills to help manage your depression. You probably won't need a doctor's referral, they'll likely assess you themselves and that will be enough. It's likely that the hospital will only stabilize you and send you to a program like this anyways. You can always decide to go to a hospital if the program isn't enough for you.  Psychology Today has [a search](https://treatment.psychologytoday.com/rms/) you can use but it doesn't have the option to filter by partial hospitalization programs anymore.

7isiqd,"About ten years ago, I was into the ""emo"" phase and wore eyeliner at times in a public school in conservative suburbs of Houston. I was bullied almost daily but I tried not to let it get to me. I know my attention seeking was definitely partly to blame, but anyways, I digress.  One day in gym class, some kids were making fun of me, calling me names and eventually the kid with cancer decided to join in and call me a faggot. I responded by telling him to ""go back to the hospital"". They just got quiet and from then on, the kids in school hated me even more. A year later, the kid passed away. The sad thing is.. I don't regret saying it. ","When I was about 13 I went to the bathroom to pee, and a few girls were in there, one of which had just recovered from cancer. They were skipping lesson and I had been given an out of lesson pass by my teacher so I could go pee.  I'm pee shy, I struggle to pee with people in the room especially if I dislike them, so I sat on the toilet waiting for them to leave. Eventually they left and I started peeing, then they came back in with someone else.  ""Is she still in there? She taking a shit or something?"" And this was the worst thing 13 year old me could've been accused of, I was so upset. I finished peeing and left the stall and washed my hands, placing my out of lesson pass next to me. The girl who'd recovered from cancer picked the out of lesson pass up and put it in the toilet, but didn't flush it, expecting me to go get it so she could record it and put it on whatever social media. I didn't and I just said ""what was that for""  They started asking me questions about my dyed hair and if I'm emo etc and I just ignored them so they started calling me rude.

7l2a34,"[Light] I'm writing this as a confession because I don't know where else to speak about this and I don't want my kids finding this out on my main account. My friend died a few months back due to heart problems. He was taking care of himself so it was a shock to everyone. Especially his wife who was with him at their house when he died. Due to this she decided to move somewhere else and because she and her daughter were still distraught she asked me to pack up his stuff. He had some boxes in his basement and after a while I started feeling nostalgic and decided to look into them. I found pictures of us from when we were kids all the way to before we got married. That was enough to make me feel bad and I just got back to taping them up.  But one of the boxes seemed to be in much better condition, so I decided to check it in case it was something important. To my surprise I found out pictures of him and my wife from when we used to hang out together, as well as more recent pictures from family reunions. The most recent being from my wife's birthday party.  Alongside the pictures there were letters that he never sent her. The first one dated 2 months before I met her. The last one was also the same date of her birthday party. There was one that stood out the most was one from after I started dating her. He wrote that his time had passed and since my happiness was as important as his own he would watch over us.

I only had one class with her where we set in desk clumps of two, so I can’t say how she acted with other people but she was a total bitch to me. Every time I tried to talk to her and be friendly she would find a way to laugh at me and be rude, and whenever I answered a question In class she would be quick to tell me how stupid I sounded.  I could go on about her but in short this girl made me dread my 6th period everyday and I knew I could never say anything back to her or complain because she would play her cancer card and make me the bad guy despite whatever she did, she even smirked sometimes when she said particularly mean things like she knew I couldn’t do shit.

7ovvkw,"[No regrets]  So, about five years ago, I was in a relationship with the person I thought was ""the one"". We were in our last year of college and planned to get married after graduating. Well, it didn't happen. Our very last semester, she went away to study abroad for three months and ended up cheating on me. I found out from a mutual friend that was in her study abroad group. I was broken. Like, literally devastated. I paint graffiti- not slurs, gang stuff and the mindless penises you see scrawled on things- more like the insanely colorful, cryptic you see adorning the sides of freight train cars. My ex knew about it and knew what my tag name was. I mostly stuck to painting freight trains and occasionally walls and freeways but this time, I was so angry that I just took to the streets painting everything. I stayed mindful not to paint small family owned businesses and the like but literally everything else became fair game. I literally had a map of the city in my room, drew out quadrants and would take my bike or skateboard and blow through the area until the wee hours of the morning painting my tag on everything until I had space in just about every area of the city and my tag was ubiquitous throughout. Roof tops, garage doors on side streets, bus stops- everything. A few months later, I moved out of the city and to the other side of the country. My friends would send me pictures of my stuff when they came across it talking about how they couldn't go anywhere without seeing it. Then one day, I got a message from my ex that read: ""I literally see your tag everywhere I go. Every time I try to stop thinking about what I did- I just get slapped in the face with another one that reminds me of you."" Eventually it led to her apologizing for what she did, confessing that the new guy she had been with ended up cheating on her and a myriad of other things that went wrong in her life.

7tf6ue,"His law firm and my house are about 5 feet apart from each other, and he has a habit of cussing out people on sight and calling the police on us for being on our porch (not at night, not being loud, just being out there with a beer in the middle of the day).  So I do this, in full view of his clients and workers. Sometimes I dramatically look over my shoulder in an attempt to make direct, stern eye contact as is a sort of symbolic “I’m de captain now” statement.  Edit: I severely underestimated how badly this would offend some people. Edit 2: Okay, so just to address a few common criticisms here on a general level:  1. “Queef” is the pseudonym I’ve been using for the lawyer. He has violated numerous parking/easement agreements in the past under the guise that he is more knowledgeable of the law and can get away with it, he’s had college kids cars towed within their legal times and used to park his car by literally ramming it into our house. Our little feud began when he threatened to call the police on me for using his driveway for my bike twice a day, to which I said he should stop parking on our wall. He cussed me out and it’s all spiraled downhill from there.  2. We don’t live in a party house, we really don’t party much at all. We mostly just pull stupid legally-blurry hi-jinks to irritate him, as he has been an asshole to everyone that’s lived in our house and on our block long before any of us lived there. Our landlord has records of the police showing up to our house for old tenants who were literally doing nothing but being on their porch because he called, and the same has happened to me. He reported a false housing violation because the cops wouldn’t come to arrest me for having a beer at the end of the day on my own balcony. An inspector came later that week and said all was fine.  3. This confession (while very true, don’t get me wrong) is clearly not something I take seriously. I am a full-time student with two jobs, no money and no time—I sincerely wish I had more time to dedicate to *pooping in front of my neighbor in a strange attempt to establish animalistic dominance*.

Having had a step parent as a kid and mercilessly torturing them for ten years I understood that I was very lucky to get a step kid that wasn't a high functioning psychopath so I made extra effort. This quickly became a step-parent scenario and I ended up with alot of 'family time'. The kid absolutely loved me, especially because I got to be the 'fun parent'. I just figured it was part and parcel of loving someone who had a kid so I just got on with it.

I hid my setup and cleaned up, hurried towards the door. He had scratches all over his arms and a big ass scab right across the left side of his cheek.

Do realize that every single person's hardships are valid and not all individuals are alike. We have different levels of emotional capacity/stability/whatever. I'm sorry life's been hard on you but that's not a free pass to invalidate someone elses experiences. What you know might only be what you see or what you've been shown on the surface. I'd like the thank the redditor who gave this post a Reddit Gold, truly appreciated. And also, for fellow suicide survivors, thank you for sharing your stories, thoughts and insights. I feel like I'm not expressing the gratitude that I feel as much as I think I should and I wish everything in my head were more concrete and I apologize. ","Ok, so now you’ve had a sign, go start the process of getting help.   And give your cat a big hug, furball is looking out for you.

Being able to discern your brain chemistry from your situation can make all the difference in the world even before you start formal treatment.    And yes, you aren’t well.  And no it’s not your fault, it’s nothing you did wrong.  Brains just suck but we’re able to tune them these days thank goodness. ",2726
7wfgui,"I used to watch over my little brother (who at the time we didn’t know has aspergers) when he was at school. Kids would always pick on him and when he came home with bruises, I ditched school (I was in high school and he was in middle school) and snuck onto campus during recess and lunch times, but always stayed a ways away.  I saw some little asshat push my brother down and watched as he got back up, picked up his books and walked away, even though the boy was following him and smacking the back of his head. After my brother made it into the classroom, I ran up, grabbed the kid by the back of the neck and without thinking, head butted him. Once he started to cry, I pulled him in and told him if he ever lays a hand on that little boy again, I’d break every last one of his sad little bones. I’ve never told anyone about doing that.  After school, I watched my brother begin to walk home and the little shits friend walked up to him, yelled something about “Some dumb older girl” (I can only assume he meant me) and he pushed my brother into the street and a car had to slam on its breaks to avoid hitting him.  At that point, I LOST it. I pulled my brother onto the sidewalk, made sure he was okay and told him not to move. I ran over to the little shit (I didn’t care that he was younger. Not ONE BIT), grabbed him by his hair and yanked him to the ground and started beating the ever loving crap out of him. At some point, I broke his arm.  The driver of the car that almost hit my brother had called the police and pulled me off of him, but backed me up 100% and told the officer the truth about what he saw. I got INSANELY lucky. The police officer told me he has a little sister with autism and he probably would have done the same thing.  Didn’t even get punished in the slightest, was just told to take my brother home and to promise never to hit anyone again. (The best I could give was to never get caught hitting anyone again).  We stopped by the 7/11 on the way home and I got us both some ice cream. I don’t know if he remembers that day now but I’d still do it all over again in a heartbeat. ",You did the right thing.

7x20ly,"My friends were having a party on campus but they didn't invite me. When I asked them about going they said I wouldn't talk to anyone and will be that one weird kid at the party. All that was true but it hurt hearing it from them. Since they had the party on university property I called campus police and told them about the party. Apparently, they had to been bored that night and went to the party to break it up. My friends were under 21 so they got in alot of trouble. I still feel bad to this day:(","Real friends don't care if you'd be quiet and awkward at a party, they'd still want you by their side if they were truly your friends.

7x9jg4,"I turned 30 recently, and since then, a lot of things have been bringing up some of the skeletons from my past... I’m realising that I’m still deeply affected by them, and still haunted by them to this day. And honestly, I just wanted to share it with someone.. When I was 11, I remember being one of the happiest, goofiest, rambunctious, cockiest, *naughtiest* kids there was. I had so many friends, played sports, had all these play “girlfriends” with all the girls in my class, and had so many healthy experiences living in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. I was just happy and bubbling with life and confidence living with my single dad. Just before the 6th grade, my dad met a woman. Her name was Dianne. She was also a single parent, except her kids were much older than me. She had three boys between the ages of 22 and 35 at the time, and an 18 year old daughter.  After a few short months of knowing this woman, my dad broke the news to me that we were leaving Melbourne, and moving in with Diane to a small rural town in the country. At such a young age, I didn’t understand exactly what this meant. But I went along with it, without so much as a peep or murmur. Soon, we moved to the small country town called Pylong, in Victoria. This town had maybe 1,000 people living in it. And my new school, in total, had maybe 50 kids. My first day of school there was a real indicator of my temperament, as I’d cause the first fist fight in all of the school’s history literally in my first day. The reason? Simply because another student suggested that I pick a fight with someone. There was no reason. I was wild! Very soon after my dad moved us in, Diane allowed her youngest son, Peter, to move in with us. Peter was 22, lifted weights, and was an absolute monster. My dad was 55. Soon after Peter moved in, even though my dad bought this house from sale of his previous home, Peter began to claim it as his own. He began bullying and intimidating my dad. Peter would change the locks and bolts on my dads tool shed so that only he would have access to it. Peter used to play with my basketball in the back yard, then kick it as hard as he could across the 1 acre paddock behind us into the overgrown grass so that I couldn’t find it after he’d finish. Peter would push me over and trip me when I’d try stand up to him. Peter began to regularly beat up my dad. To a bloody pulp. In front of me.  Peter’s temper was like a hair-trigger, and anything would prompt him to hurt my dad. Sometimes my dad would react a little to Peters bullying, and then it would be on. At any time of day or night, Peter would just lay into my dad until he’d have broken noses and chunks of hair missing from hair scalp.. One night, my dad was sleeping in my room with me to get away from Peter. It was like he was hiding in my room. At about midnight, Peter came in to my room with his older brother while we were both sleeping and started both beating my dad up together.  Sometimes when this would happen, I’d run to the next door neighbor’s house and beg them to let me inside to call the police. But other times, I’d just stand there in fear watching it... frozen.  Though I only lived there for about 1-2 years, it felt like forever. I’d pass the time after school and on weekends, by literally breaking into whole streets of houses not far from my own. I wouldn’t steal anything. I’d just break and enter, walking around in the houses of strangers. I had no friends, I had no outlets, I had nowhere to go, and no one to see... I missed Melbourne so so much, and felt like I’d been ripped out of my happy, bright environment in the suburbs, and placed in this town that felt like a prison made of dirt roads and nothingness. I felt isolated, alone, and like I was taken away from everything that made me happy...  I yearned to go back to Melbourne where I had friends who loved me, and where ever hung could be normal again. Where I could be normal.  This all happened for about two years. But for my entire teenage life, I was withdrawn into myself. I was shy, embarrassed, scared, quiet, frozen, all through my highschool years... it took me until I was about 20 to come back out again, resembling what I was like in my previous childhood years. And this might be a story for another time. But all throughout this time, for my whole life, I was also dealing with an alcoholic mother who I’d see on weekends. My experiences with her equally devastated me. She committed suicide (I believe) when I turned 17. I never forgiven Diane or Peter. Im haunted by them. I sometimes imagine what I would do if I could pay them both a visit, and let them know exactly what they put me through. I’d tell Diane that she is a horrible human being, and I’d tell Peter (and his brother) that I’m not 11-12 years old anymore, and that iv been lifting some weights of my own. Sometimes I still feel trapped in that house. Iv never felt closure or resolution. Iv never felt justice or peace... it’s hung over me for all these years, and I don’t know how to answer to it. I don’t know how to forget it all.. I don’t remember Diane or Peter’s last name. Sometimes I think that that’s God’s way of not allowing me to do something that I could regret.. Thank you for reading my story.  EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone for your support and encouragement. Iv very rarely spoken to anyone about the things such as this that iv experienced in my life, and I’m so grateful for all your thoughts and replies: 1. Yes, I absolutely do want to resolve this against Peter legally. My dad had called the police, so there would have to be a record of it somewhere. Does anyone know how I could follow this up? Or if it’s too late? How can I make him answer to what he did? If you have any suggestions please feel free to PM me. 2. I see a lot of people are asking about my dad and how he is now. After I left his house when I was 16 (new house we moved into after it all happened), I dropped out of highschool, and moved to Sydney with the little amount of money I had. I built a life for myself there, independently. Meanwhile, my dad went into business with his daughters husband, sold it after about 10 years, and used the money to retire on his eldest daughters property in his travel caravan. He loves it, and occasionally takes long solo trips around the Outback of Australia with his dog. He’s at rest, and I am incredibly relieved for him. ",I know I shouldn’t be saying this but I would get a justice boner if you found peter and beat him to a bloody pulp.,765

81drss,"Me and my wife bought a new bed. A really expensive one, the kind that has separate firmness on each side. We spent hours and hours in the store, where my wife took her time testing and deciding what kind of lower mattress she wanted on her side. Beforehand, she had done extensive web research on what kind of bed would give her most happiness in life, and so on. Eventually she settled for one with firmness between soft and medium.  Me, I couldn’t be bothered with that. I’ve always liked my beds soft, but the store lady said that with my body composition, I should have a hard mattress. So during a brief brain fart, I chose that.  Next morning, I knew I had f***ed up. The $2000 bed I’d just bought felt awful. Even worse, when installing it I’d taken the plastic wrapping off the lower mattresses so I couldn’t return them.  The solution - while my wife was at work I flipped the bed 180 degrees, so that now I have the soft mattress, and she has the concrete slab. There are two additional full width, thick mattresses on top of those, so it’s not immediately noticeable.  This was five years ago. I’ve slept like a baby ever since. My wife apparently still hasn’t noticed, at least she hasn’t said anything, and she seems to sleep well. She must never know, though.

I of course wanted to snoop onto his account so I checked his history, and found all of his posts for the past month had been been to /r/depression  One post mentioned how my family, including me, were out of town due to me playing sports. That was the night he said he would finally commit suicide. He mentioned either pills or knives and it still haunts me to this day. I was obscenely scared when I found this post, and was home alone and vowed to myself to never let anyone know that I found this. To this day, my parents do not know, and have tried to keep me in the dark about his struggles with mental health as much as they can, and my brother most definitely does not know. The only person who knows is my now long term girlfriend, and now you guys. I feel awful for never telling anyone in my family, and I feel like this has taken a toll on my own mental health, which in itself is not in a good state at all. I just want to thank whoever dissuaded my brother from commiting suicide that day. He doesn't know how much of a positive impact he's had on my life, and you kept him around so he could further that impact.","Take this chance to tell him what a positive impact he's made to your life.

84wtmq,"[Remorse] Never told anyone this, it happened about a year ago. So I live in a flat that's in a part of town that has a lot of bars and breweries. In the summer I like keeping my sliding door open and I often stay up quite late at night. As a result I hear rowdy, drunk people shouting and carousing from time to time.  So I was curled up playing video games really late one night and I hear a loud yelp. Sounds like a girl. But I thought ""eh, bars are closing right about now."" Then a few moments later it was a shout. But again I ignored it, loud noises, even shouts, were common late at night. Besides, I was comfy and engrossed in my game. ..Then it was a scream. And, regretfully, I *still stayed put.* I lied to myself thinking ""*I'm tired, and its probably nothing.*"" 20 tense seconds later and I finally hear her voice again, **""Raaaaaaapppeeee!!!""** Holy shit. This is happening. she's been getting **raped** this entire time. My stomach flipped and dropped. I jumped up from my couch, grabbed my baseball bat, and sprinted out into the parking lot. But it was too late, all I could see was a car screeching out of the far end of the lot. I couldn't even make out the licence plate number. I could've saved her. Redditors, if you think you're hearing or witnessing some bad shit going down, don't retreat into your bubble, don't hesitate. ACT. We're all humans and we're all in this together.","Think about this. You reacted, or failed to. You did not act. If you had taken a more measured approach, you might have quietly observed, noted important info, and decided whether or not you could or should intervene. You might have gotten the plate or a photo, but saved the girl? Possible but unlikely. You might have gotten dead. A lot of guys think that they can just roll up and save the day. But a lot of guys also do not have the violent tendencies that a rapist does. We think we do but we really don't. That rapist has chosen to raise the stakes higher that a normal civilised guy has. So you think you would be able to intervene but he has a plan to defend himself and you just have a bat and no situational awareness. I am a smallish guy who hasn't been in a fist fight since high school (the 80s...) and I was able to intervene against a way bigger guy swinging a bat in December because he had no plan and I was calm and focused (I had an advantage of time to prepare mentally and he was just dumb). As soon as I saw him swing at another person, I knew he wasn't committed to the violent act and I could rush him. He recoiled when I didn't show fear and ran. That guy is not the kind of guy you might be up against committing rape. Rape on the street is not Bill Cosby rape. It's violent. It's psychotic. Dude is probably carrying a knife or gun and has rehearsed his response to a defender a thousand times in his deranged mind. He probably has drawn blood before. Stakes are way higher for him than rando dumbass picking a fight over pride. You might get lucky but you might get dead too. The takeaway here is be the smart hero. Act, don't react. And be glad you aren't like that guy. It's what makes you better. Edit: I wanted to add another anectdote. Only 3wks after the bat guy encounter, I had another similar one in which two joyriders rolled up on me and my gf on the street. We live in a relatively affluent neighborhood so we were not very attentive. The whole thing went down differently. I was not calm or in control. I knew if this went down, my girl was gonna get hurt. My concern/fear was evident im that split second I was face to face with one of the two men. He knew it and he delighted in it. We ended up running which was the right choice but I was pissed. That encounter juxtaposed to the first is what made me really think about acting vs reacting and situational awareness. I consulted some experts (friend who is a cop, another who is a self defense guru, and a psychologist) and my gf and I discussed how we could have avoided that encounter, deescalated it, and managed a physical confrontation if it came to blows. We have a plan and are more savvy now. That's where I am coming from in this comment.",609

85ruqu,"On June 27th 2017 I intentionally overdosed on Heroin in the Handicap stall of the Ladies' room in Oglivie Transportation Center. And it worked. I was found with no pulse and not breathing. For MONTHS I resented the fact that I was brought back. I laid awake every night sobbing, abusing every drug I could get my hands on, and even attempted suicide two more times but to no avail.  Since then I met the love of my life, and she makes me want to stay sober. I want to remember every moment I spend with her. She proposed to me a bit over a month ago and I want to live as long as possible so that I can grow old with her. On our first date we went to a protest, and got cold so entered the first building we saw. It was Ogilvie. We ate Panda Express and had our first kiss there. I didn't even realize it at the time but she gave me life in the building where I had almost successfully taken my life. Yesterday we went back there and I showed her exactly where I died. I am almost 5 months clean now and am so fucking happy that I was given another chance at life. The road leading here was rocky, but I'm grateful for every bump along the way because this was the road that lead me to her. That's not to say the road isn't still bumpy, but we have each other to ride it out with.  We've had some devastating financial hardships recently and are homeless. But home is where the heart is. Home is holding hands and laughing at our situation from a bus stop bench. Home is cuddling up in an alley to stay warm in 0° weather. It's kind of funny that now I want to live, and I have to worry about surviving. This is a new feeling. It's stressful,  but I'm happy. The only tears I've been crying lately are happy ones. Edit: I'm not depending my life and sobriety on one other person, I was already on medication, sober, in therapy and on the right track when I met her. She just makes me extra grateful for life because I didn't think love would ever be an option for me and she supports me and my healthy goals.","Congratulations Op, glad you got a second chance at life",1157

87lt2j,"I am sex worker and I have alot to confess LONG POST  I am an escort who lives in a legal location for prostitution. I have been thinking about how people view my profession and how it makes me feel among other things.    I was reading a comment on a post the other day and I felt awful about it. The comment was along the lines of how most girls wouldn't date a guy who has been with an escort. It made me feel that people view escorts as non human/objects.     Which honestly I'm used to. I've actually wanted to post to roast me stating i am an escort just to see if I am truly desensitized to all of the derogatory names.    The profession I am in is so much more than what it appears to be. I've substantially helped many clients with anxiety, lonliness, depression, emptiness etc. Its been statistically proven that areas with access to sex workers have lower rates of suicide/homicide. At times I feel like I am a sexual therapist. I listen to these men, actually listen. It feels like a slap in the face when most people talk about "" hookers"" as objects/ gross/addicts/have daddy issues etc.  (The one thing I will admit that is stereotypical is I'm a self identified sex addict.)    Yes, some clients are only seeking something they can't fulfill outside of their relationships, but even then, I can't tell you how many times I have sat down with a client and gave them advice on how to better connect and restore their relationship.    I've also been feeling lately that I view men and relationships so much differently now. I used be a jealous and controlling person in relationships. I am introverted by nature so when I would find someone i connected with I would put all of my energy into them and get possessive out of fear that my relationship could be jeopardized by another person. I eventually decided being alone and fixing myself was for the best.    And now being a single provider I look at the whole idea of relationships differently. I just see people as timebombs. Waiting to get bored, stagnant, resentful of one another, growing apart. It looks like a heartache.    I also have become jaded and find men untrustworthy. (Yea I know, it's fucked up to generalize a whole gender) I've met so many men who sneak around instead of being honest with their partner. And even though this is my profession I still root for them to no longer need me and fix their relationship. I fear because of being a sex worker I have been tainted to the idea of love and honesty.    And there's times when I have no one to talk to about how I feel. How encounters with certain clients leave me emotionally bankrupt because their energy was so dark. Which I guess led me to posting a confession. I don't know, I'm kind of rambling now. But there's still so much more I could vent about! I've realized in this profession there's never one way to look at everything and I'm always contradicting myself with how I feel.   All in all though I do enjoy my work. I like making people happy and helping their mental health even if it's frowned upon.  Sorry if this is jumbled and hard to understand, I wrote it quickly just to vent.","I live in a condo downtown and my next door neighbor is a sex worker. I will admit that at first I had all the biases and even comtemplated telling my strata because of the thought of ""dirty"" strangers coming in and out of my building at all hours.  However one year I was having a Christmas party and invited her. I knew her as a neighbour and although it was obvious she was an escort who worked from home, she hadn't officially disclosed it. At the party me and my fiance got to know her and felt that she was actually really down to earth and very sharp. She could hold a conversation and had a very pleasant personality. Since then we have invited her to multiple of our house parties. She has even disclosed to us what she does and now on occasion tells us when she has a client at her house that she may not trust or is not a part of her regular clientele ( for safety purposes ). She is definitely a good person and since then me and my fiance have developed a huge respect for sex work. I know this doesn't address your feelings about relationships, however, I hope it does address your feelings about how many people see sex workers as objects. I feel regular nine to fivers have narrow minds because they're taught that you get a degree and you get a job and that's the way of life.

8cyfid,"EDIT: She's been to the doctor for both Celiac & gluten allergy/sensitivity tests. Her results came back negative for both, but she says the doc is lying in order to run more tests. EDIT 2: Holy shit is my inbox blowing up! EDIT 3: This was 2 years ago. His mother found out and gave us a severe tongue lashing, then told the sister and she screamed at us for an hour. We've not done it since, and will never do it again. --------------- We were both so sick and tired of listening to his sister whine about gluten this, and gluten that. And she'll carry on about how everything had to be gluten-free to the point where she's taken over the family pantry. Mind, we both understand the seriousness of Celiac disease. So the only reason we decided to test her was because is how she eats when it something she really wants. One night she found out halfway through dinner that her dad forgotten about the GF breadcrumbs she'd bought, and had instead used the normal variety he's been cooking with as far back as he can remember. Holy hell did she raise a stink! Completely stopped eating her meal and sent the rest of the night bitching & moaning about stomach cramps and other assorted bathroom issues. This carried on into the next day where she lectured him about gluten allergies while still morning about bathroom problems. Now, when it's something she really wants, is a completely different story. She'll eat whatever it is and go about her day like a normal human being. Not a peep about stomach pains or anything, sometimes she'll even have seconds or behind it to work for lunch the next day. So here's where we expirimented with her. The recipe called for browning the hamburger then mixing in some flour to make a paste. I was going to skip it entirely to be nice, but my fiancé said he wanted to test her response. So I made the recipe as listed but only he & I knew about it. Everyone ate the dinner, rave reviews! They told me I could make that again any time! And wouldn't you know, not one peep from the sister. She even had it for lunch the next couple days and still not a word!","Per OP's request, we have locked this thread. ",5609

I decided to wait untill i cool off and think about what to do. So the next morning, i called the pizza from a phonebooth and ordered almost 80$ worth of pizza. I gave them the adress of the appartement next to me wich was empty. I turned off my TV so i can hear him coming. He came more than an hour later and start knocking the door. Of course no one responded. He insisted by knocking loudly. So i opened my door, and sees him with a ton  of pizza. I just laughed and closed my door.

A month ago I added a couple younger hens to my small flock, and my neighbors cat came into my yard and killed one of them. Less than a week later, my OTHER neighbors small yappy little dog dug a whole under my fence, and came into my yard and killed another one of my hens. I covered the hole with cement, and the dog simply dug another hole to get in again. This is around the time I made the decision to get a rooster. Roosters are famous for not only being loud and extremely annoying, but also for protecting the entire flock from predators. Two birds with one stone you might say.

8dqfzj,"My 2.5 year old thinks he’s a dinosaur. Like...24/7 acts like a dino. It started at about a year old when I made him a dinosaur hoodie for Halloween. He started pretending a lot and “roaring” at everyone. Then in transitioning from crib to bed he picked out dinosaur sheets and it’s all dinosaurs all the time from then on.  He roars constantly and at total strangers. He has a whole dinosaur “family” of toys that follows him everywhere. He walks like a dino and tell me every morning what new species he is and gets really upset when I forget today’s type. At first I thought it was cute. Then after a week I got concerned. Now after a couple months I’ve fully embraced it.  With an active two year old, it’s sometimes hard to get him to calm down and go to bed. But since the dinosaur “awakening” he’s gone to bed flawlessly so long as I pretend he is a “longneck” traveling to the Great Valley (Land Before Time reference for those that done know). I spin this big story and he closes his eyes and gets so excited. It’s his favorite thing in the world. MY favorite thing in the world is hearing a quiet, whispered “rawr” in response to my “goodnight, I love you.”  He’ll probably be upset one day when he discovers I’ve used his overactive imagination to trick him into sleeping, eating broccoli, walking faster on our hikes, etc. On the other hand, I have two months worth of super cute videos of him “speaking” dinosaur, so I think I’m okay with it. :)  🦖 🦕 ","When I was a kid, when I was a little boy, I always wanted to be a dinosaur. I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus Rex more than anything in the world. I made my arms short and I roamed the backyard, I chased the neighborhood cats, I growled and I roared.

But he didn't really say that, he said, ""Stop being a fucking dinosaur and get a job.""  But seriously, I don't see anything wrong or weird about a 2.5 year old thinking he's a dinosaur.

8edx47,"[No Regrets] I don't know how many there are, and I don't remember where they are hidden.  It started so small. It was a simple prank. There is a briefing on the bulletin board that has been hanging there from a thumb tack for as long as I've worked here. It's meant to be very important, but I have never seen anyone so much as glance at it. It's maybe ten pages, so it took it down, removed the staple, placed [this photograph](https://goo.gl/images/l7M6qT) between its pages, and put it back together again. To this day, no one has noticed.  So I decided to keep doing it. Every now and then, when it's slow or everyone is away at a conference, I'll hide another one. I know for sure that there is one behind the calendar, and another taped to the back of a bookcase. There's a few in the conference room, I'm sure, and in the copy room and kitchenette. I think there's at least one in the director's office, though, if there isn't, that will soon be remedied.  I plan to leave this job in a few months. I will tell no one when I leave, and I plan to hide many, many more before I go. *Edit-* Thanks you guys! I didn't expect this to blow up.

8h4fb3,"This has been on my mind for a while now. It's something that happened 10 years ago and I've kept it a secret along with my friend who also never told anyone about it but it's been making me feel depressed because I feel cheap and used the more I think on it. So yeah 10 years ago when I was 16 I went to a concert with a friend that was by a pretty big band, they were big in the 80's and still popular then so we were pretty excited to go. I'm not going to say who it was and I'm not really thinking of trying a lawsuit or anything I just want to talk about it and stop bottling it up inside.  So we went to this show and it was awesome, the band were fucking amazing and we were in tears through most of the thing it was that good. This was the first proper concert I'd ever been too and the crowd and everything else was electric.  Before the show we were at the front and got talking to one of the security guys and joking around so after we saw him again and we asked him if we can go backstage and get an autograph and maybe a picture. I'd bought something in the hopes of getting it signed so we took our chances asking, can't hurt right? So he kinda smiles and says he'll go ask somebody if it's okay, he talks to this guy who it turns out is their tour manager and he looks at us for a minute and then asks us what our names are and we tell him and I say I won't bother them for long I just want my record signed etc. He thinks for a second then asks if he can take a picture of us for the tour photos and we agree posing for it. He then says he'll be  right back and will go ask the band if they are okay with visitors backstage.  We were really excited at this point because it looked good, we spent the time talking with the security guys about all the bands they've seen play the venue and the tour manager comes back a little time later and says he'll take us backstage giving us a pass. Some others had shown up by then asking but he turned them away saying they can only accommodate us and that since we asked first he'll let us in. When we got backstage there were already women hanging around, they didn't really look like fans so we assumed maybe they are girlfriends or wives etc. The tour manager introduced us by name but nobody seemed too interested at first. After a little while they call us over and we talk to them. I'm super nervous and ask them to sign my record, they sign it and we talk about it and they tell us some stories about when they recorded it, we take some pictures and all seems great.  The conversation slowly gets more personal, the bass player asks if I have a boyfriend and some questions about my sexual experience. I answer that I've not done much more than kiss a guy since I didn't really know what to do. I was scared that if I didn't answer they'd think I'm weird and kick me out or something. They seemed more talkative after that and invited us to sit next to them and made conversation. They asked if we'd come to their after party and we excitedly agreed thinking we were really cool because we were getting into a real after party with all these famous people.  They left and we were taken in another car to their hotel and ushered into a back door and  into an elevator. The crew members took us to a room and let us in where the band guys and some others were hanging out. We hung out at first, they gave us alcohol and got us drunk, we just thought it was fun at first. They offered us pills and weed and we agreed to it all because we didn't want to say no. I started feeling lightheaded and like something bad was going to happen, I said I wanted to leave and tried to get my friend but a couple of the guys told me it'd be fine that they'd take me home when I sober up. They told me to lay down and ushered me to one of the beds. I remember really feeling out of it but I recall seeing my friend on a chair and one of the band kissing her and his hand was in her skirt.  At that point I felt somebody touching me and he said it'd be okay because he'll be gentle. I tried to push him off but he kept pushing me down until I gave up fighting and just let him have sex with me. Everything just went silent in my mind at this point, I knew what was happening to me and I knew somewhere they were doing the same to my friend but I just went to another place. After he was done they pretty much just took it in turns to have sex with me and my friend. After a couple of times I was sitting up and felt sick, somebody gave me some medicine and said it'd make me feel better and I just took it and tried to find my clothes stumbling around. They were laughing at me and somebody asked if I need a shower which I did. There was like a door between two rooms and one guy who I guess was one of their crew or something pulled me in the other room and said to use the shower there. He was commenting on how I have a nice body and as I got in the shower I got really dizzy and blanked out, I felt somebody get in there with me and I assume it was the same guy, he did stuff to me and I lose time there, I woke up in a bed naked and the crew guy was standing around on the phone, he hangs up then he told me to shower and get dressed which I felt like I was doing before I blanked.  After I did he was waiting for me and grabbed my arm pulling me into the corridor. He asked somebody about another girl who turned out to be my friend and they said she's in another room. He knocks on this door and an older guy in his underwear answers and inside I see she's on the bed naked. He says to get her in the shower and dressed because he's getting rid of us. We wait for a while and I can barely stand because I still feel drunk and sick, she comes out looking confused and she's crying we hug and then the crew guy still has an attitude and tells us to move pushing us to get in the same elevator we came up in. We go out a door and into a car where he asks where we live. My friend said her address because she knew her parents weren't home and her older brother was at his girlfriend's place so we wouldn't get in trouble for staying out late.  The guy dumps us a couple of blocks away and tells us to walk which we did. It was like 3\-4am when we got back I just showered again and went to sleep. I was really angry the next day and cried but just said it was nothing when my parents asked what's wrong. I just tried to bury it and forget for years after that and so did my friend. We never even spoke about it after that day we just agreed to forget it. Some stuff triggered my memories recently and I keep having flashbacks to these guys all standing over me laughing while they hurt me.  I guess they knew I was just another stupid teenage girl impressed with a little star power that they could manipulate and they took full advantage. I'm not even sure if everything that happened to me because I blanked for a long time. I don't know of anything that happened to my friend but she probably had a similar experience to me. I remember seeing older women at the hotel partying but nobody else our age. I wonder how many teenage girls this happened to, if they regularly invited some to take advantage of them and dump them after like garbage. I feel used and cheap for letting that happen to me. ","You need to realize you were assaulted, physically, sexually, mentally, basically every way possible when you were only still a child. I'm sure you understand it but clearly don't feel it. You are a victim, you did absolutely nothing wrong. Are you still friends with that same girl? As adults now I think you should discuss what happened to you. It will never go away by ignoring it. Did you ever go to the hospital? Did you get checked for STDs?  Basically every teenage girl who goes to concerts dreams of meeting the band. The fact you and your friend were attractive opened that door that unfortunately was horrifying. It likely happened to hundreds or thousands of girls if the band was popular since the 80s. That said that means these guys were What? In their 40s or 50s? And clearly knew and targeted you for being underage. I can't find the words to describe how horrible everything you went through was. It makes me sick. I'm very sorry you went through that. I seriously think your friend and yourself should sit down and walk through what happened. I think it would help. The perspective of a 26 year old is much clearer than a 16 year old. It's hard to face painful memories, and this sounds dreadfully painful, but you need to turn your guilt or embarrassment feeling into anger. Even if you don't legally want to do anything, you should be angry at them and for yourself. You didn't deserve what happened. Neither did your friend. Neither did any of the other girls. Also shame on every single one of those ""adults "" who witnessed what was happening. They all deserve the worst.",4059
8ifsd3,"Little back story: I had kidney stones while pregnant and all that could be done for me was narcotic pain management. After he was born, the doctor didn't wean me off the meds I'd been on for months so I developed a habit. At the time I had a ""best friend"" who was a druggie, so she'd get me pills whenever I needed them. After a while, we both decided to get clean and get better. I was clean and knew she was trying to get clean too. When my son was 5 months old, this ""best friend"" was babysitting him and borrowed one of our cars to run some errands. We got a call that she'd been in an accident on I65 and totaled the car - with our infant in the back seat. Come to find out, her ""errands"" were driving to a shady part of town to buy pills and snort whateverthefuck off a coffee table while my son was in his car seat beside her. When we got to the scene of the accident we had multiple witnesses tell us she was doing speeds of over 100, and appeared to be nodding off at the wheel. She rear-ended a family down from Indiana on vacation. When we showed up, she was holding my son and the first thing she said was, ""They're already telling the police this was my fault, they're all liars, you know I'd never put him in danger."" I said, ""Just give me my baby,"" then the police pulled her aside to talk. While getting our belongings out of the car, my husband found a needle in the front sear. My son was fine; his car seat had been wiggled slightly sideways, but in an abundance of caution he was still taken by ambulance to Vanderbilt Children's. I cried the entire way. My son could have died because I decided to keep a woman around that I thought was a friend. This was years ago and I haven't spoken to her since that day. I am 100% clean and sober now because of this, but I still feel such a tremendous guilt that I have nightmares, and I'm crying now as I type.","Forgive yourself.

It got even worse when they learned im agnostic which apparently meant atheist. I avoided going to their home after that. I was also pretty pissed with my date who kinda agreed to some stuff, he is a big mama’s boys. It came to times that he commented about how my clothes were too revealing or how i should reconsider being agnostic. He let his religion and his family get a lot into our almost relationship!

8j8dho,"I worked at a fast food chain in the 90's when I was in high school. When I worked there they were in the process of phasing out denominational gift certificates. ($5, $10 & $25)  The way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. So if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. My manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards.  So my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when I was closing I found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. They were FILLED with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. So, I scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. After we closed, I came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. I counted them. There were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. None of them had expiration dates. Total haul was $40K in fast food certificates.  My manager never said a word, he couldn't. He had reported them destroyed weeks earlier.  Over the next three years my girlfriend and I toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. We never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half.  After the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up.  I bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change. And for some reason A kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. We threw away a lot of kiddie cones.  Edit: Holy crap this blew up.  Here are the answers to some of the FAQs 1. We could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours.  Both of us would use a gift cert.  it was not that labor intensive.    2. The only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window.    3. The manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently.    4. Each gift certificate had a generic PLU on them.  E.i. All the $25 were PLU #756. 5.  When we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid.  They were not coupons.   6.  One can only eat so many ice cream cones.  ",The biggest confession is throwing away the free kiddie cones.,4922
8jl44l,"I was at their house taking with her and her family and oh boy it was getting boring.  I decided to head over to the washroom and one thing led to another so I decided to start masturbating.  I was wearing a short dress so all I did was take my underwear off, seat myself and go at it. I thought I had locked the door but turns out I hadn’t. Thought the knob thing turned all the way but I guess it didn’t lock it.  Worst part? The toilet itself faces the door, so her little brother opened it up and SAW EVERYTHING because I had my legs spread on either side of the toilet. The door doesn’t creak at all so I pretty much hadn’t noticed until the door hit the door stopper and made a noise. So the little dude probably saw a good (almost) 10 seconds of me just going at it.  Obviously at that point I had stopped and talked with him for a minute and not to say anything. We had dinner afterwards. He stared at me. I stared at him. And every time someone asked him something or asked him what’s new with him, I was shaking.   I don’t think I can go over to her house without having the awkwardness from knowing that her brother isn’t forgetting this anytime soon. I’ve gone there some times after and once, the dude even reminded me to lock the door ffs.  1) always lock the door and if you’re going to masturbate, do it at your own house.  2) a kid half your age, isn’t forgetting catching a girl masturbating at his friends house anytime soon, so be wary of where you decided to do this.

One time he told me that he met a struggling single mother and he felt bad for her, so he paid her a few hundred dollars to do an enema on camera for him. She took the money and blocked him. He said he was so upset because he was just trying to be a good guy and help her out because she seemed desperate for money.  Fast forward a month or so and I’m underage drinking and skyping with him. I had been passively complaining about being poor, as a 16 year old without a job does. He figures this is his big chance and gives me a proposition. I assure you that this next part is 100% true. He offered to pay me $120 to stick baby carrots in my butt for him. I’m like “ummm, no thank you” and he raises it to $160 if I do it twice a month for him. I tell him “I respect your kink but please keep it away from me”. He keeps trying to convince me and offering better prices. Meanwhile, I have another chat open with a bunch of friends from 4chan. I tell them whats up and ask if one of the boys wants to do me a favor when the time comes.  I sheepishly agree with carrot guy that I’ll stick baby carrots in my butt for him and ask him when he wants me to do the deed. He says right now. That catches me off guard because he was at work in his cubicle at the time. Im like “wont people see” and he tells me he’ll go into the parking garage. So I go to my kitchen and realize that we only have regular carrots so I grab a few of those and a knife and tell him that I’ll just cut them to baby carrot size.   Picture a dweeby 16 year old girl whittling away at some carrots with a knife while a 26 year old asian man watches from his office cubicle, dictating how big she should cut them. Every time I would hold one of my creations up to the camera, he would tell me to go bigger. Let me tell you, the end results were at least 3 times bigger than a regular baby carrot.  When I was nearly finished with the preparations, he made true on his promise and relocated to his car in the parking garage. That’s when my head jerked in the direction of my bedroom door and I scrambled to hang up the skype call, clearly in a panic. I enter the 4chan chat and tell them project buttcarrot is a go. One of then calls carrot guy, pretending to be my furious and overprotective father. He asks carrot guy if he knew that what he was doing was illegal and could put him in prison. Carrot guy sounds fucking terrified and is apologizing profusely(I’m listening in on the call). My ‘father’ tell carrot guy to send $500 to my paypal and he wont call the cops.  I bought Christmas presents for all of my friends that year, never spoke to carrot guy again, and I didn’t eat carrots for a long time.  Epilogue: I’m 22 now and I moved across the country about a year ago, to the city that carrot guy lived in. No big deal, it’s a really big city. Imagine the adrenaline rush when I’m walking down the street and pass a familiar face on the sidewalk. I had to do a double take. Never in a million years did I think I would come face to face with the one and only carrot guy. But there he was. Luckily he didn’t recognize me as my appearance has radically changed since I was 16, but that didn’t stop me from looking over my shoulder for the rest of my day out.  I want to say that I have no regrets but honestly I have a few. One of them is that I didn’t ask for more money, as he had a nice enough job anyways. Another is that I didn’t just go to the authorities. Sometimes I wonder if he really learned a lesson from this, or if he went on to prey on other teenagers and if I could have saved them.   Edit: Didn’t realize how angry this would make people so I’m gonna clear a few things up for yall. First, this story is kind of funny so I tried to work that into my narration and wrote my two regrets in a way that I thought would be funny. Yes, I do wish I got more out of the deal. Because now that I’m an adult I realize that $500 aint shit.  More importantly, I really do regret not calling the cops. However, as dumb as they are I had my reasons not to. The biggest reason at the time was that I didn’t want to ruin his life. I had gotten to know this guy over a period of almost a year, he painted a sad picture of himself to me so that I would pity him. And even though he was preying on me, up until that point I viewed him as just my friend. When you are a young girl in a predatory relationship like this, you don’t notice the red flags like an adult would and you don’t know the proper response. Extorting him for money was not the proper response. If I could go back to that moment with an adult view of the situation I would have called the cops. But I didn’t. Whoops.  Time and time again, I think about reporting him still. However, I no longer have access to the skype account I used to talk to him. And on top of that, unless they changed it recently, when you log onto a skype account with a new computer it doesn’t carry over old conversations. I have no idea if there is a way to recover them. If there is, hit me up and I can provide sweet sweet proof of this whole thing(provided I can remember the email and password to the account itself).  But yeah, I probably shouldn’t have blackmailed him. However, he probably shouldn’t have tried to buy literal CP soooooo","In all honesty, guys like that, who proposition desperate teenage girls, NEVER change. But you were just a 16 year old girl; I cannot fault you for not going to the authorities or even not telling your parents about butt guy. IDK what to even tell you; just be careful out there.",2628
8lal5n,"I do all the marketing for the company \(making literature, website design, adverts\). I found that no matter how hard I try, if I hand my boss my work, she will make changes to it...always. The changes would be so useless as well ""move that image 1cm down, use different bullet points"". Then one day I went into her office with my brochure and I used the word second draft...my work was approved straight away. Suddenly a pattern emerged, if my boss thought that my work was a first draft, she would make changes to it, if she thought it had already been revised she would actually look at the design of the brochure and make constructive changes if needed. So now I will always walk into her office saying ""would you mind reviewing this brochure, originally I had designed it like \*blah blah blah\* but now ive put it like this"", even if it is a first draft. Just saves me so much time and she actually looks at my work this way.","I've seen that too. Managers need to trust their people and force themselves to not correct or try to improve everything.

8lmu1o,"I used to work at a Cheesecake Factory as a server. About 1.5 years ago my current boyfriend came in with some other girl for a date. I’m not sure what it is about my boyfriend but he just does it for me. He’s not at all my normal type of guy I’m attracted to but for some reason he just makes me melt every time I look at him.  He’s got this super self assured smile and something about the way he talks gets me. He’s got this little chuckle he does and he always looks down and bites his lip after...he’s just like **it** for me.  So I immediately rushed over to their table. Typically, if I saw a guy I was attracted to I could give better service because I genuinely wanted to interact with him and everyone at the table and that usually lead to nicer tips.  When I started serving them, I couldn’t help myself and I was flirting super obviously. So much so my coworkers were telling me to be careful I didn’t get complained on. But he flirted back so I was like a shark who smelled blood in the water.  I spent so much time talking to him at their table other tables I was serving had to call out to me because I’d forget about them.  Honestly, looking back that was more of a date for me and him than her and him because we talked about what he did for work, what I studied, what my favorite foods are, what he likes, music. I must have been at that table, accumulatively, for around 40 minutes. At the end of it she was being very short with me and him and I kind of figured she’d complain. So I said screw it, scribbled my number down and put it under his card when I gave it back to him. He texted me that night and we’ve basically been dating since. I’m moving in with him on Friday.  It was honestly a very rude and shitty thing to do, but I’d do it over again in a second. ","Remember, r/confession is meant to be a safe place for people to open up and confess wrong doings.

8p96aa,"EDIT: Thanks for the support. To clarify, I have had sex like, a couple times. 3 times with first girlfriend ever in 2008, once with another ladyfriend in 2009, I think 5 or 6 times with my ""most serious"" ""girlfriend"" that I dated for a whole 2 months in 2012. Two one-night stands over the next 5 years, then my second most serious ""girlfriend"" I saw for about 6 weeks, we had sex like, 5 times, that was toward the end of last year. TBH I don't crave sex as much as I crave just some kind of physical contact with someone who genuinely likes me, even just some non-sexual cuddling. I mean, I have a decent handful of friends who I'm close to, but just about every woman I know has a boyfriend (not that any of them have shown interest in me as more than a friend anyway), and online dating just never goes anywhere. I'll talk and talk and talk and we seem to get along great, but the moment I mention getting together IRL, they're gone. I try getting to the IRL meet right away, they don't respond to that either. Shit sucks. EDIT 2: To those suggesting getting a pet, I do have an amazing little kitty and she has helped me through my darkest hours. While a 9lb cat can't quite offer that physical contact that you get from a hug from a fellow human, it is pretty tough to stay too depressed when she hops on the couch, flops over placing her head on my lap, and looks up at me with with those big kitty-eyes. I strongly recommend a pet to anyone struggling with depression. And while I've said I hate people, I'm actually a very friendly guy on the personal level and get invited to plenty of social events, I do my best to be a ""fun pessimist"". The comedian Doug Stanhope is a pretty close match for my personality, like, all fucked up in the head and clearly depressed and thoroughly dissatisfied with society, but as long as we're here, fuck it, let's try to have some fun. As for the dream, I didn't get laid, but I did get a kiss from my old highschool crush so that was nice, and then I got to fly a spaceship, so, not a total loss I guess? EDIT 3: Wow this blew up way more than I thought it would. For those suggesting a hobby group: my main hobbies are video games, metalworking and shooting, unfortunately, very male-oriented hobbies (I'm bi, but my interest in men is pretty strictly sexual and only pops up from time to time, and as I've clarified, it's more of an emotional and intimate contact I'm looking for, rather than casual sex). Though I am a crazy cat person, maybe volunteer at a cat shelter? The reason I've always gone for online dating while ignoring most ""conventional"" dating opportunities, is that I'm really a pretty weird dude, not a total freakshow, but there are a number of things about me/things I need in a partner that I'd really rather get out of the way right off the bat, instead of spending several weeks building a relationship with them only to find out that it's extremely important to them to have kids (I'm 29 and that seems to be especially big to most single women out there my age), or that they're saving themselves for marriage and will only do missionary with the lights off so Jesus will be happy with them, or that they believe Trump is our savior and football players kneeling during the anthem should be convicted of treason, OR that they believe that you're literally Hitler if you didn't vote for Hillary and you laugh at racist jokes. (All of these things have happened when I tried Tinder and doing the old ""don't reveal significant details about yourself"" dating style that most people seem to do) Would it be especially un-kosher for me to say right off the bat: ""Before we get too far into this, I'm an atheist libertarian with a kinky side, I definitely don't want kids, and my sense of humor is so dark it's only counted as 3/5s of a sense of humor, are you cool with that?""",Well honestly that's pretty rip,667
8r0fg1,"So I grew up in a small town with a small school system (250 graduates) and there had been one kid that plagued me practically 5th grade to senior year. He was mean, dismissive, and always made a point to put me down or call me stupid. Anyways through a friend of a friend of a damn friend I found out this kid had an edgy ass tumblr account.  MFW: https://goo.gl/images/LLwMWt The night of this discovery, I hatched a plan. I made a fake tumblr account calling myself Stacy (it’s not my name) and saying I was from California (it feels like everyone’s from there) and posting typical girl tumblr stuff, getting followers, etc.  I basically spent a week concocting and grooming this fake account of mine - there couldn’t be any flaws.  Once I felt like my mask had been adequately made I popped him a PM “Hey I like your profile pic, is that you?  ;-)”  I waited for what seemed like hours, checking and rechecking my account to make sure there was absolutely no way he can tell it was me. Suddenly, my inbox notification lit up: “Yeah, wanna see more ;-)”  Success.  For the next few days I had texted this kid, digging into his personal life and his secrets, trying to find anything that would give me a leg up on him. It didn’t take long for him to get comfortable with an anonymous girl with the thirst he had, and things started to get....fuzzy.  I’ll never forget it. I was up in bed, getting a little sleepy, when he messages me:  “Hey can I ask you a question?” Hm okay. I respond “Sure, go for it”  He takes a while to type but finally it comes out:  “Do u got any fetishes?” I look at the time - 1 a.m.  Ah yes, the peak thirst hour Though I was feeling a little uncomfortable to be discussing this with a greasy fellow I knew, I decided to trek on. Thinking of the first fetish that comes to mind, I quickly respond “Ya I love tentacle porn” Without hesitation he responds “Oh..here’s mine..” and links me to his alt tumblr account: Pages upon pages of drawn furry porn, gifs of people screwing animals (actual animals guys) and even a few pictures of him in cat ears and a tail. To say the least, I was shocked, and it almost hurt to look.  After that I never responded. He continued to send me a few frantic messages but stopped after a few days. In school I struggled sitting across from him, knowing of the secret alias he lead.  I had uncovered a goldmine of blackmail, but with such a prize came the curse of having to bear the knowledge that this kid wanted to screw animorphs and horses. In the end, it was too cringey to even blackmail him with it, let alone tell anyone else about it. I just couldn’t go through the awkward exchange that would be telling him it was me the whole time, and then have to go to school with him for another year. And when you think about it, we both kind of lost there. But I don’t care.  Screw you, Kyle, you were mean and I’ve seen those weird ass pics of you and your fetish  TL;DR: Kid was mean, made account to catfish, uncovered dark furry secret, didn’t tell anyone in end        ",So I have a friend who went to high school in a tiny town in the Midwest. There was a guy at his school that everyone refers to as “goat boy” because his sister walked into their barn one night to discover him screwing a goat. A GOAT. And worse? The goats legs were in the guys boots so it couldn’t get away which probably means it wasn’t the first time. So gross. So cringey. Apparently no one liked him and even some of the teachers called him goat boy. ,1241
8rjjt2,"I was not in a good mental spot. It wasn't some big epic fight that started it. We had a disagreement and I flipped. I didn't black out, I was fully aware of my actions. We were in a happy relationship, at that point 3 years in. I woke up one day and we had a little arguement over something I don't even remember now. He tried walking away to let me cool off and I lost it. I grabbed my gun, told him we were going to talk. I loaded it and held him at gunpoint in our bedroom for about 8 hours. I had never been violent before, no warning signs etc. He talked me out of it and instead of calling the police he got me the help I needed through medical professionals.  I was diagnosed with PTSD, social anxiety and depression (possible stemming from the PTSD).  He was there for me every step of the way, and the guilt I feel will never go away from my actions. Life could of gone such a different way if I pulled the trigger. This was 10 years ago, and we are married and have 2 beautiful children. Looking at us now, no one would imagine what happened. We never told anyone, and he stood by me at my darkest moment.  Mental health problems are real. Instead of locking me away, and running for the hills he helped me when I needed it the most.

8tko25," I came out as bisexual to most people when I was 18. When I turned 19 I started dating a wonderful girl who I considered marrying. I was head over heels in love and she wanted me to tell my family. I was scared. They are conservative and my dad was even a Pastor for a while. I loved her enough that I did. I told everyone in my life. I was blocked by most of my extended family and didn't talk to my mom while I was dating her. My dad was uncomfortable. he pretended he didn't care because his wife is okay with that but he totally did.  Awhile passed and I realized it was my first love and I wanted to figure myself out before settling down. I dated around for a few years and didn't favor either gender. I dated a couple girls and a couple guys. Currently I'm with  a wonderful man who I adore. We have been together 5 years and are getting married in October.  Everyone thinks I went through a phase. My mom always tells me that she's glad I snapped out of it. A lot of my friends, some in the lgbt community, make jokes about my 'gay phase.' they knew I would end up with a man all along because bisexuality isn't real.  Others are angry I'm with a man because I'm suffocating my lesbian self.  Some ask if I'll ever get a girlfriend after marriage  because it's not cheating, right?? One of my best friends gets drunk and tries to kiss me when she's drunk because she's bi too! Plus our partners would love to watch It!  It makes me so angry and I wish I had never told anyone.

","I'm gay, but from hearing stories from friends and others such as yourself I've come to understand the struggle of being out and bi is truly real.

8vt58w,"So my parents had been “married” for 18 years before they got divorced back in 2012. I was 15 or 16 at the time. I put “married” in quotes because even though the purpose of getting married is to basically solidify your love with someone, they were definitely not in love. At least, not anymore. I remember my parents getting along well when I was young (around 3) but a few years  after my brother was born, things took a turn for the worst. They were constantly at each other’s throats. They would argue with each other every. Single. Night. My brother and I were terrified that something bad would happen during these arguments. Then, when they weren’t arguing with each other, they were taking their anger out on us. My dad was just abusive and would go out of his way to find reasons to beat my brother and I with coat hangers until they broke. And my mom was just reacting to the frustration. She would sometimes smack us, but that was the extent of it. Eventually, at the age of 15,  I decided that I had had enough. I was sick of all of this physical and emotional abuse. Everyone in the household was hurting. So I suggested divorce to my parents and talked about it constantly when the other parent wasn’t around. So eventually my “manipulation” worked and they got divorced. And honestly? It was the most liberating feeling ever.  I don’t know if I was in the right for doing this; I sometimes feel like a manipulative bitch when I think back to it.

I wasn’t any different. When I was four or five, I got one of those small $2 packs of some Star Wars character that’s usually on the side of the checkout lanes with all the candy and gum. I didn’t know what it was then, but there were blasters and I wanted it. I wasn’t a spoiled child, I never asked for much. So my parents didn’t really care, it was only $2. I didn’t know what I was getting in to. By the time I was six, I had watched all the Star Wars films and cared too much about the Clone Wars show. Ten years later, I’m still a Star Wars nerd and I’m currently surrounded by four giant posters and a bunch of memorabilia.  Let’s go back again. When I was 8, I bought my second lego set. I actually knew what Star Wars was this time, so I wasn’t going to get a set of some random unnamed Jedi that died during Order 66 fighting against one clone trooper.  I just got some regular $10 one. Not the mini packets, but not the giant cardboard sets either.  I wasn’t a very needy child, it was the second lego set I ever bought, the first one from two years earlier still in perfect condition to this day. But there was this kid. This damn kid...

So I decided, alright I’ll just walk in and get it after the kid moves away. That kid literally didn’t move away. His hands all over MY box and the one I wanted. He started crying all over the place. Smearing his hands all wet with tears on the box. He held it in his hand and ran all over the store with it. His face was bright red, damn, he WANTED that thing. After his guardian said no for the millionth time, he put it back on the shelf. It was time. Run in quickly, grab it, pay for it, and walk out. So I ran in, grabbed it, paid for it, and walked out. But this isn’t one of those small mall locations. This store was huge. The checkout counter was at the very back, so I had to walk for like a minute to get to the front. Since I was at the store with my family friend, I just sat there while he picked out some lego set meant for kids, like the bigger blocks kinda thing.  Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Kid. The kid comes back to the same location, dragging his mom. It’s probably the first time the mom even walked there with him, she just kept saying no before. The kid was so confused. The box which was there minutes ago, was suddenly gone. His mom thought that there was nothing there in the first place, she picked him up, and carried him out the store. The kid, still bawling his eyes out. As the mom had him over her shoulder, the kid glanced at me as he was being carried out. He saw the set he wanted in my hand. Keep in mind that this set is small, so I told the cashier no when he asked me if I wanted a bag. I mean I’ll just put it in the bag of another store my parents are shopping in, no need for more plastic bags. The kid sees it. He starts screaming and pointing and trying to get his mom’s attention. The kid barely makes out the words telling his mom that I took what he wanted. Now, she understands that I took what her son wanted. She comes up to me, with her kid staring down at me as I’m sitting on the ledge by the front of the store. “Thank you.” EDIT: “thank you” as in an actual sincere thank you. Not a sarcastic “thanks a lot” type. EDIT #2: I didn’t buy it to spite him. I wanted the set originally, the kid was just there. EDIT #3: here it [is](https://brickset.com/sets/theme-star-wars/year-2008) (the first one, the “Imperial Dropship”) EDIT #4: I’m not an adult doing this out of spite. I’m currently 16, I did this 8 years ago. The kid was maybe 5 or 6. I mean I guess I felt bad about it. I was in his position two years earlier, really wanting something that I really wanted. Guess time just changes like that. And that’s the story of how I displayed my superiority over a crying child, without T-posing. ","Honestly, that’s a good mom.  Had she caved and got it.

8xsmd7,"This was an accident and happened about 10 years ago. I had recently joined a Chinese owned company in a fairly prominent position and being the only white guy in the company, they liked to send me to trade shows in China to indicate that the company was definitely NOT Chinese. I was sent to Guangzhou to the Hotel Dong Fang just around the corner from the convention centre (extraneous detail not really needed but here to show this is genuine). Of course with a convention centre in town with many visitors, the prostitute madams/agents were out in force. Most of the people handing out cards for whores where very young kids (seriously young. They looked about 10 years old or younger), often the only English they spoke was, ""You buy, so cheap"". Every time I went out, I had kids pushing cards into my hands, into my pockets or dropped into any boxes I was carrying. Most of the time that was that. End of story. On my my second to last day, I went out with the sole intention of buying presents for my wife and daughter, when after the first shop I was approached by an older madam who would not leave me alone. Every step of the way she kept with me encouraging me to ""buy, so cheap"". Even my protestations that I was married and not interested was met with, ""your wife not here, you buy. So cheap"". Eventually, she said, ""Tell me your room number. I send girl to your room. Just $200"". Thinking this was the best way to get rid of her I said, ""$200? OK, I'm in room 1024"" and then carried on shopping. Since this was a fake room number and I had no intention of carrying out the transaction, I promptly forgot about it. Next day, last day of the show, I was told the boss had flown to Beijing and I was needed to help a colleague collect some stuff from his hotel room. I walked with my colleague, dodging the kids with prostitute cards, back to the hotel until I was standing outside my boss's room. Room 1024. I have never, ever dared ask or say anything to my boss about this. Only my wife knows this story. And so, too, do you. TL/DR: I accidentally sent a hooker to my boss's hotel room - pretty much what it says in the title. ",Well what happened after???,5286

8yowrq,"[Light] I’m a 16 year old boy I live in the suburbs. Tonight we have a big parade in the downtown of our city, so tons of cars are driving there and back. I dropped off my parents so they could drink, and had to take the neighborhood route back home since all the main streets were packed. I went 20 on the neighborhood roads since there were people and parked cars everywhere. I noticed a white minivan was riding my ass and I was a little annoyed but not angry yet. Then we got to the stoplight, and they tried to cross the double yellow lines just to be ahead of me in the left turn lane, but I sped ahead because I was not having that shit. So we were both waiting to go left and I had the longest yellow arrow of my life. Also EVERYONE was going where we came from so there was not a single gap I could have went left on.

925bz6,"I'm always very reserved; the opposite of an impulsive person. This was an exception. Some backstory: this all happened a few years back, in college. She was my only serious relationship, which lasted about a year. Wicked smart woman in most ways, but emotionally? Total idiot. We had that in common. She was going abroad for a semester and decided that she wanted us to split up  (so that she could focus on her studies) with the intention to get back together after she returned to the States. We were both pretty torn up by the decision but admitted it was probably for the best. I tried to support her by keeping my distance, but confusingly, she reversed her that stance very quickly and started leaning on me (as an ex in a different country) for all her emotional support. It was pretty rough. I did what I could but obviously it wasn't enough. Then, I hit the low point for my own loneliness and reached out. She immediately flipped the switch and acted uncomfortable that now I was the vulnerable one. She texted me at the end of summer that she no longer wanted to get back together, but tepidly left the door open to change her mind. When the new semester started, my ex continued to give off mixed messages. Right away she wanted to be best friends, but I really wasn't in the right head space for that. As you might imagine, I still had some hangups about how I was treated and didn't want to jump into a deep platonic friendship without some sort of reconciliation. About two months later, she invited me to a dinner party. Thinking this would be a good avenue to make amends,  I bit the bullet and attended. It was immediately awkward. We barely even made eye contact at the party...but she WAS very chatty with some other boy I'd never seen before. Turns out that in addition to her bitter ex-boyfriend, she also invited the guy she was currently sleeping with to the same party. Whoops. This already felt like a slap in the face for me, but just as the party was winding down, she couldn't even wait until I'd left the room before grabbing the other boy's hand and walking up to her bedroom with him. It sounds hackneyed, but I never truly understood what people meant by ""heartbreak"" until this moment. The entire center of my body felt like it had run out of batteries and just shut down, sitting like a lump of cold metal in my rib-cage. Once I had stumbled home, I swigged some suspiciously cheap vodka and contemplated carving my ex's initials into my arm with a pocket knife. I was badly out of sorts. In rare act of spontaneous judgement, I began gathering up all the little mementos and gifts she'd given me since we had first met. Some of this shit was the most thoughtful, clever things you could hope for from a significant other, but I couldn't bare to look at them anymore. Without digression, I tossed everything related to her in a garbage bag. I admitted all of this to her months later, in a rambling, mopey email. She was understandably distraught that I would do this. What I didn't tell her (or anyone, for obvious reasons) was this next part. Right next to my bed, I had taped up a painting she'd made in a class. It was a white-on-black, minimalist rendering of a nude woman. I was never aroused by it or anything...it was just a cute little art print that my ex had created and decided to gift me. I put it on my wall because it was hers, not because of what it looked like. But for whatever reason, whether because of the subject matter or the fact that it was hand-crafted by her, this print was the one and only object I would not let enter the trash unscathed. I tore it off the wall, then angrily jerked off into it (thinking of my ex the whole time, of course). It was the most wrathful masturbation I've experienced to this day. Once I had finished, I looked down at what I had wrought. I was mostly disgusted. Why did I even do this? But...something about the contrast of a white puddle on a black canvas, obscuring the image of the nameless woman painted there...well, it was oddly aesthetic, in a childish way. And fitting. This wasn't my intention, but in that moment, I felt like a bit of an artist. No way in hell this nasty thing was going back on the wall, though. I crumpled it up, tossed it in the bag, and walked an extra block to a faraway dumpster where no one would recognize me. The whole thing was gross, stupid, immature, aimless, and did next to nothing in my goal of getting over the relationship. Years later, I'm still single, and I still miss her. All the same, no artist could have created a better visual representation for my complicated feelings at the time. I may have defiled a piece of innocent art like a sad creep, but for a brief instant, I grieved as a heartbroken painter.

92d9hn,"For context, I'm a 25yo woman. Last month, I was at my parent’s house. I was helping my mom with something when I noticed a piece of paper barely sticking out of a folder. All I could see was a title that ended with the phrase “As Rape Survivor” and something that looked like my sister’s name next to the right margin on the second line. Yes, I know, I shouldn’t have read it. But I dare you not to do the same in my position. There was a split second where I considered pretending I’d never seen it. But selfishly, I thought I \*had\* to know. And naively, I thought that whatever I could imagine could be worse than what had happened. After all, my mother was and is a popular likable extrovert who drank like a fish in college and always had a date to dances. And well, norms have changed. There are experiences that might seem like rape in hindsight that would not have been considered so at the time. I was expecting a story involving fuzzy boundaries and fuzzy memories, the edges worn down by the decades passed since. It wasn't that I wanted to invalidate her experience precisely, but mentally minimize it so that I could neatly consign it to the same place where I keep stories about her grad school roommates. Until I started reading. It was the kind of rape that people often imagine when they talk about rape. Behind her apartment. By two strangers. At gunpoint. On her 24th birthday. My mother, the woman who believes that people are fundamentally good. My mother, the most empathetic and emotionally intelligent person I’ve ever met. My mother, the woman who leaves our front door unlocked at least 80% of the time. She was raped at gunpoint when she was six months younger than I am now. She talked about how it tested her support network - how her new boyfriend dumped her and how people—female and male alike—asked what she was wearing. How men who had been casually interested in her suddenly treated her like she was infected. The whole essay made me feel nauseous. True to form, her essay framed the aftermath reactions as a valuable relationship litmus test. She severed ties with some friends and drew closer to others. I can't help feeling like I failed the litmus test. By picking up that paper and by making assumptions before I’d even started reading. I betrayed her and stole something that belonged to her.","Women pretty routinely get blamed for their rape. I'm close friends with a woman who was raped when she was 15 at a party. Her boyfriend walked in, accused her of cheating on him, beat her up and threw her out of the house naked. Rumors then started in her school about her being a whore until eventually she had to move schools. This story is not *at all* remarkable or unusual.",706
92v55c,"About a year ago I joined a group of men that advocate for white nationalism and other far right nonsense. Too be honest I didn't care or like any of these people in the slightest. The only reason  joined them was because some of  my friends were going to that ""Side"" of the political spectrum and they were getting angry about stupid political shit like I was. I did a lot of crazy stuff like vandalism and basically getting drunk with other skin heads and Aryan brotherhood drug dealers. I slide down this kind of spectrum, I acted like a fool and made myself look stupid. Eventually after a few crazy events happened I stopped talking to my white nationalist friend and started doing my own thing for a while through mostly work. I got this crazy idea to actually go to a Synagogue, a Mosque , and a church just out of fun. When I went to these places almost all of those people treated me very well, including an elderly Jewish couple. They treated me like a part of their own family and introduced me to their kids. The Muslims treated me the same way and even gave me some free classes about the Quran. But I think the worst part of all was when I went to a catholic church and I saw every race on the face of the planet in this small town I used to live in. And I felt so bad about this whole thing. Because I had judged a lot of these people before they even knew me. But In all honesty I'm sorry I did some bad things to these people and I don't want any harm to them. I guess I'm glad that God helped me realize what I did was wrong and I don't want anyone to do the same things I did. But again I'm sorry for what I did I hope some of you can forgive me.","It just goes to show that very often, racism comes from a lack of exposure to other races and cultures.

9398na,"Back in grade school when I was about 10 I stole $40 from my mothers purse to use whenever I wanted to buy something. Once I got to school that day though I saw one of the other kids had a can of dill pickle Pringles which are still my absolute favorite to this day. So my stupid 10year old self gave him all $40 for that single and enjoyed every single of those delicious fuckers.  When I came to school the next day though the same kid I bought the Pringles from, gave me back the $40 while crying because apparently his mom screamed at him to give it back and now he couldn’t buy candy with it because his mom wouldn’t let him keep it. I held on to that money for a couple days until my mom started looking around and asking if I had seen the money laying around since it wasn’t in her purse, so once I realized how I’d get my ass beat if she found out I hid it under the couch and ‘found’ it about 30 minutes later.

93rrnc,"The placebo effect is incredible.  I have epilepsy and a year ago I started using an alternative medication called “Charlotte’s Web”. It is a type of marijuana that has very little THC (the stuff that gets you high) and a lot of CBD (the medical stuff). They give it to children in an oil form.  I consume it via a vape and do not get high. I purchase the Charlotte’s Web and put a bit of it in a bag labeled “King’s Kush”. Sometimes when I’m with friends I offer them some King’s Kush (which is actually Charlotte’s Web) **FOR FREE** and I pretend to be getting really relaxed within five minutes with just a couple of puffs. The majority of my friends, even the ones who smoke recreational marijuana quite frequently, tend to start acting really relaxed when I give them the Charlotte’s Web. I told my girlfriend that we were trying one called the “Lover’s Leaf” and that it was a well-known aphrodisiac. My girlfriend couldn’t stop telling me how horny she was. **WE DID NOT HAVE SEX**. She told her best friend, and I gave her some (which was just Charlotte’s Web). Her best friend’s boyfriend thanked me for that stuff. A friend of mine recently got real King’s Kush and he told me that the high he was getting was different from my stuff, and he preferred mine. Maybe the dispensary I went to had higher quality marijuana. I confessed to him that I’d always given him Charlotte’s Web, which doesn’t have enough get anyone high, but he couldn’t accept that and insisted that my stuff definitely got him high.  I’m probably going to keep telling my friends that it’s King’s Kush. It makes them really happy. Clarification: I am NOT selling my friends marijuana. It’s usually just me and some friends talking while I vape, then they ask if they can try it, then they act high.  Edit: From what I’m learning, I guess it’s not entirely a placebo effect and it is a real relaxing high from the Charlotte’s Web. However, I’ve tried other strains and those are definitely different highs. ","It's a very different high, but it still has effects, it's not only placebo.

950fmp,"When my ex and I started dating, I used to make him a morning cup of tea as a cute gesture and it stuck for the three years that we were together. It's a nice small thing you can do to make someone's day and and it's a nice way to get to know how someone likes things doing. So, my morning tea used to be any old teabag (Yorkshire tea if it was on offer), a splash of milk, and the first cup always had a teaspoon of sugar; every cup after was just tea and milk. My ex however had to have a very specific ritual: Thompsons Punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. He was adamant that he could tell in a heartbeat when his morning cup of tea and at the age of 33, he's never liked any other tea other than Fortnum & Mason's Royal Blend. So, in the beginning when he would stay at mine, I entertained this notion and used to make his morning tea the way he liked: Thompsons Punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. He would always thank me and tell me that I make the best cups of tea and it was nice, three times a week didn't kill me and it was a sweet gesture. Fast forward three months when he would spend nearly everyday of the week at mine (but not moved in), he was very demanding of his morning ritual and being a student, I couldn't keep affording to buy that brand of tea; besides, what was wrong with PG tips or any non-branded supermarket tea? Tea is tea after all. So, I used to always make his cup of tea with any tea bag, a teaspoon of milk and no sugar. I was always sure to only make it when he was in the shower or still in bed so he could never catch me out and initially, he was dubious and was always asking to make sure it was Thompsons Punjana tea (he used to call it by it's full name to emphasise how good it was). after a few trials of different teas, I finally found that sweet point where he couldn't taste the difference. I would drink it with him and as he sipped, would go on about how you can taste the quality and that there is really no other tea like it. When we moved in with each other, it was a lot harder to disguise the fact that I was keeping the same box of tea and just filling it with regular tea bags so I had to be a bit more clever. At the time, I was studying at college so I was in control of weekly food shops and only really wanted to go twice a week to minimise costs so we had more to spend on meals out. I used to buy one bag of his tea and two bags of mine a week and kept them in the drinks cupboard. When it came to making his in the morning, I would take one of his teabags and put it in my pocket, giving him one of mine instead and I used to give my tutors at college his tea to drink during the day. He would always comment that I run out quicker of my tea bags because of the quality and that with Punjana, one bag is enough for a considerable amount of time; little did he know. This went on for a couple of years and I never told anyone about it out of fear that he would find out, as after all, he really couldn't tell so why ruin the fun? It was saving me money and it was sort of amusing. I never let him make a cup of tea unless I was away so he never really had to find out.  After we split up, we remained good friends and I've spent some time with him too in our old flat. Every time I visit, he always asks me to make a cup of tea the way I used to for old times sake because everyone he's been with or dated after me can never ""make it taste the way I did"". He even says that when he makes it himself with Punjana that he could never make it taste right and that I was some sort of special tea maker. I still haven't told him. This is a long post about tea so the TLDR: ex used to play on that he was very fussy with tea, I switched his morning cup to a considerably cheaper tea bag and he could never tell the difference and still can't.",I can feel the Britishness in this post,9325
963zjc,"I had a very strange introduction to heroin. I got sort of tricked into it. I had snorted pills before, and the person told me it was an opiate when we did it at a party. This was in 2002, before a lot of pills and such were laced. This party was a sketchy party, I knew almost nobody there at all, it was mostly older people from new york. Except when I did it, it was like 100 times stronger than any opiate I had ever tried before. It felt mindbogglingly amazing. I obviously wish I never did it. I was super drunk at the time and was basically down to try anything.  I found out it was heroin while I was on it because the guys friend was yelling at him for basically lying to me and saying it was just an opiate, but at the time I didn't give a single shit. I was in blissful heaven, just laying down on that couch.  I was a popular girl at my high school. Not like the mean popular ones from Heathers, I was more like the main girl from Clueless. I did drugs and partied but I got good grades and presented myself as the preppy good girl to all the adults around me. I was very well liked by people, and was friendly to people. I threw parties which everyone liked. I was involved in clubs and sports teams. Even to *me*, it was just weird that someone *like me* would ever try something like heroin.  But I was hooked, right away. I contacted this guy micah who had dropped out of our school, I knew he sold. He had no friends in the school, he barely even spoke english. I told him I was getting it for a friend who had a horrible disease where they could barely walk, good excuse right? Anyways, I did the same amount as before. Very, very small amounts.  At first I tried to keep it down to once a week. I knew how bad it was. My parents were good, normal successful parents and they would murder me if they ever found out. But I got obsessed with how good it felt. Addictive doesn't even begin to describe it. Nothing felt even close to the feeling that even a small, small bump of heroin gave me.  Over time I did it more often, but the same amounts. I think it gradually got worse and worse over the span of like 8 months. I was RELATIVELY good at keeping myself from becoming a full on addict. For one, my dealer knew I was the one using at this point, and he felt really bad about me. He wasn't a real heroin dealer, he was a user who was selling me some. And eventually, he cut me off.  For a bit I struggled. I wasn't able to get H and I was so desperate for it that it made me depressed, and I think my anguish in relation to my addiction became more obvious to those around me. My parents chopped it up to me being depressed or anxious, my friends basically thought the same. I did something incredibly risky to find a dealer, I went through someone at our school and said my friend was looking for a dealer. Its possible that the person I contacted could have told everyone and my whole secret would have been blown wide open, but they didn't.  And so I found this new dealer, and he was sketchier than micah, but had better stuff. I went back to snorting after my month or so long break where I had no access. I paid for it just mostly through my job. It didn't take long for my tolerance to go back. I entered my senior year of high school as a dope addict, but found it easy to maintain my image as the cool popular girl. Nobody, and I really mean nobody except my dealer, knew.  Eventually, I knew I was heading to college at the end of the year. I knew I couldn't go on like this at all. Sometime after my 18th birthday, I went sober. Part of it? For my 18th birthday, while all my friends wanted to party and my parents wanted to take me out to a nice dinner, I faked being sick so I could stay in my room and do H all day. It was all I wanted. That was kind of a wake up call for me to get sober before this got worse. And I went back on it a week later, and then 5 days after that I went sober again. During this time, I basically was just in my room or in the park most of my days. I skipped a ton of school. My parents had no idea what was wrong with me.  Eventually, after trial and error, I actually managed to be sober for a while. Like 5 months. Then I took 2 of my moms pain meds and got high from that, and was VERY close to going back to my dealer but decided against it.  I went to college sober, and there was not even the opportunity to get heroin at the college. My urges went down, and eventually I just stopped thinking about it as much. I never tried any opiates, ever, after that.  I also never told anyone about my addiction to heroin. Ever. Not even my current husband. Never my parents.  Its just so weird to think about honestly. I was so, so not the stereotype of what a heroin addict was, and yet I was one. ","You'd be surprised how many people spend years creeping in their own dark places. Its like wandering out alone on an iced over lake with the wind howling in your ears. No one knows how close you were to falling through the thin ice and never coming back. How many people fall through and hammered their fists against the underside trying to get out? The lure to wander back will always be there like a familiar comforting whisper, but most people need others to help them resist the siren waiting to pull them back. Plug your ears and find a helping hand. Stay safe. Good luck.",1838
96v9xd,"It's been 4 years since he died. I know I'm responsible for it. He was 17. He wasn't very popular in highschool, but he'd been invited to his first big party. I was excited for him. He wanted to try get some more friends,become more popular. I helped him pick out what to wear, told him what to expect and do and all that shit. He'd asked me to buy him booze to bring with him, but instead I gave him some of my weed. He'd smoked a couple times with me before, I thought he'd be fine. I dropped him off, and told him to call when he wanted a lift home. That was the last time I saw him alive. It was about 3am when my I heard my mum crying. From what I was told, he smoked and shared the weed with some people. They decided to go out to get food. My brother was the only one who hadn't had any booze so they asked him to drive. Him and 3 people went out, during the drive they say he ""fell asleep or something"". He crashed into a pole, he died on impact and the person the front got their leg injured. The two in the back had minor injuries. The police investigation was short. The car was okay and wasn't to blame, no signs of speeding, it had to be the drugs. I knew it was my fault. My parents tried to comfort me after I told them I'd given it to him, but I know they partly blame me too,things haven't been the same since. I fell into a major depression. I drank and smoked pretty much all day. I lost my job. My parents tried to help support me financially but I spent all the money they gave me on booze and weed. My friends all disappeared after I stopped replying to their messages. It took over a year before I realised what I'd become. I started seeing a shrink. Got clean. I'm 2 years sober. But every day I still know what I've done. Every day I regret that decision. I've written this out dozens of times over the last couple years. My doctor says it's good for me. I just want to post it online in hopes it does something. I don't even know what. I don't deserve forgiveness. Edit: I would like to thank all of you for your support and care and everything. I honestly didn't expect this and how many people would even read this.  Despite how many of you feel, I do truly believe I am responsible. I didn't make him go behind the wheel, but I gave him the weed that caused it. Without that I truly believe he wouldn't have crashed. The police said there was no alcohol in his system and I honestly can't imagine he took any other drugs. But that is behind me now, it's a mistake I have to live with, Ive come to terms with that. Edit 2:  I'd also like to clarify he didn't crash at 3am, that's when we got the call after the passenger had been pulled free because her leg got caught and was getting treatment. APlus it was in a semi-rural area, it would've taken police 30 minutes to get there. I believe that the police report said it happened around 1:30 to 2am. A few have said that weed isn't a drug or wouldn't have caused this. But it is and it did. 2 years ago I would've agreed with you, but after therapy and getting clean i realised it is and that I was a drug addict, to both alcohol and weed. I've also come to terms with this. I hope that anyone in my situation gets help like I did. I used weed and booze as a tool to escape. I used it so I could pretend I wasn't myself for a few hours or just so I could sleep at night. But really it just hid my problems and that isn't healthy. There is help out there. The only positive I can say from my story is that my brothers death woke me up. Since getting clean I've started exercising, I'm going back to university next year, and my mind just feels more clear. It's kind of hard to describe. I don't want to say 'Don't do drugs' or make this a whole weed is bad thing. But don't use drugs to hide from your problems I guess is the point. Seek help and help those who need it. Thank you all, truly. Edit 3: this will likely be my final edit to this post. Once again, I'd like to thank all who commented for their advice, criticism and everything, it's all important as part of my therapy, even the negative. What has disturbed me is fighting about weed, people have even messaged me to show their anger at me for saying it lead to the accident. Saying that it doesn't make you tired, which is bullshit, I smoked and occasionally did edibles for 4-5 years, a lot of the time to help me sleep. Whether it was him falling asleep for a moment and losing control, or a bad trip, or spacing out, or getting distracted, it doesn't matter. Many people are insinuating he was drunk, but the police confirmed he was not I believe as part of the insurance claim for the car. I don't know, but they told my parents he hadn't been drinking. I did this to try get some things off my chest, not so people could argue about how amazing weed is.","I'm sorry for your loss, my friend...

Every interview I've gone on so far where the interviewer was a woman resulted in me being offered a job.  I now purposely lock eyes with women during interviews because it makes them feel attractive even if they're not.  I don't care about them and I continue this behavior even after getting the job.  What I learned is women aren't really that different from men when in a position of authority.  They like being around attractive people and will render undeserved preferential treatment.  I've had married female attorneys, admin assistants look for excuses to touch me and I encourage this behavior because I end up in higher paying positions or cushier environments when I do.  I'm aware this treatment will decline as I age, but I'll capitalize on it as long as I can.","My boyfriend is quite handsome and very sweet, and the way older women treated him while he was working in an office was nothing short of creepy on many occasions. A lot of the comments they made would have never been tolerated had they been made by a male (to a female), but since it was a bunch of 35-60 year old women making sexual innuendos to a 21-yr old boy it was all considered good fun.

I am fairly confident in my body and didn’t mind showing it off at the time. Now that I have a boyfriend, however, my tune has changed on that subject matter.  I’d post at least twice a day and get a bunch of messages. One guy kept commenting and messaging me, telling me I was sexy and how much he loved my body. For some reason I kept talking to him and we basically developed a sexual relationship and sexted all the time, but we never showed our faces. He was very nice and sweet to me even when we weren’t talking about sex. Keep in mind that I was always very private about my identity because I didn’t want anyone to blackmail me.  I even made up a name and location as to where I lived. I thought it was a bit weird that this guy had the same name as my brother (although my brother *is* very good looking and 10/10 would bang if he wasn’t my brother) and lived in the same state, but figured it was simply a coincidence.  For his birthday a few months after we met, he sent me a pic of himself without a shirt on and his magic stick erect and told me he wished I was there to suck him off and asked me if I liked the new tattoo he got for his 25th birthday.....  But I was.  In the living room downstairs. Celebrating my brother’s birthday. His 25th one. It was the same tattoo my brother showed me earlier that day. It was the same bathroom. Same shower curtains. Same hair products. Same perfume. Same toothbrush colors. Same everything. I was mortified, but I didn’t stop. My brother really is a hot guy and I liked what he had below the equator. I couldn’t help myself, so I continued to sext with him for a few more months until I told him I had gotten a boyfriend and could no longer do that with him. He understood and we went our separate ways. The worst part? I still touch myself to his pics on occasion.  EDIT: Yes, this is real. As for the people talking about how we didn’t recognize each other by the same house and such, I was in college and lived in a dorm room. It was not the room I had at my parents’ house. My brother has a fairly plain room and sheets. I thought it was normal to have only white, black, and navy sheets. Yes I had seen my brother shirtless before, but I had never seen his dick and he didn’t always show his full body in the pics he’d send.

9arjfb,"This is a lengthy confession. I'm sorry if you don't like reading long posts you can skip to the end if you want. Our first daughter was raped when she was 14. It destroyed her childhood and flipped our lives upside down. You always assume if you bring your child up right and take care of them nothing bad will happen, but something bad just happened anyway and there was nothing we could do afterwards to make what happened right. The man who did it got sent to jail eventually, but our daughter was never the same again. Counseling never brought her smile back, nothing seemed to work. She seemed so cold and emotionally dead from there onward and we tried so hard to connect back with her but nobody could. She was an island and didn't want to talk to anyone about anything. We as parents blamed ourselves for this. We ended up pulling our daughter out of school to home school her because her attendance was very bad and she suffered night terrors which kept her awake some nights. It was probably a bad decision and over protective parenting, but we wanted to protect her and felt a regular school wasn't a safe environment for her at the time.  As if the situation could be any worse we found out our daughter was pregnant with the rapists child. We tried to suggest an abortion because of her age and the situation, but she didn't want to. Our daughter refused to abort the pregnancy, so we kept her out of school to give birth to the baby. We raised the child as our 2nd daughter to give our 1st daughter the life she was robbed. We just wanted her to enjoy her life and told her we'd raise the baby for her as her sibling and she agreed to this. It was partly out of fear of what the neighborhood would think, and partly out of wanting our daughter to continue having a normal teenage life. It wasn't ideal, but things worked for a time and our daughter got to see her daughter whenever she wanted, which was better than giving the baby up to adoption. Things didn't last this way for long though as our daughter's mental health started to deteriorate.  When our first daughter started to become heavily suicidal. There was nothing we could do because every time we tried to get closer to her she'd push us away worse than before. She was hospitalized several times for suicide attempts until she succeeded in committing suicide. This destroyed us. At first we hated the baby and blamed it. We blamed it for the death of our daughter and were in denial it was our fault. Eventually though we realized we were to blame, not the child who was brought into the world by no fault of their own. We'd focused for so long on the fact it was half of the rapist's child, that we'd overlooked the fact it was also half of our daughter. It took a lot of time to come to this conclusion, but we'd always looked after the baby out of respect to our daughter. The thought of giving it up to adoption went through my mind several times, but I knew my daughter didn't want this and so did my wife. We gave her daughter, our daughter the best life we could. We bought her anything she could ever want, took her to concerts and on holidays. We even sent her to a private school despite the extra expense with hopes that she will become successful in life and live the life our daughter never got to live. She is home right now and whenever she hugs me or my wife and says: ""I love you mom/dad"" it hurts like a dagger through our hearts. I always look towards my wife every time our daughter says it. She finds it as painful as I do and I can tell by the look in her eyes. It's not that we don't love her, it's that her entire life is being lived believing a lie. We're actually her grandparents and she has no idea of this. She's never asked if we're really her true parents because obviously she has never had a reason too. Part of me though believes lying by omission is still lying though. We've never told her the truth about her sister being her mother. She knows her sister committed suicide, but she is too young to remember her. I feel as though we're protecting her from being damaged and hurt by keeping her oblivious to all of this. Maybe I'm just being selfish, maybe my wife is too. We just don't want to see her suffer. The thought of her not being strong enough to hear the truth scares me the most. I know I shouldn't compare her to my other daughter, but I would never forgive myself if she committed suicide too after learning the truth. I cannot lose both of them, I can't survive another loss like this. The whole situation is soul crushing. The only person I can talk to is my wife. It feels like some massive thing nobody else can ever know. Not even our parents know the truth.","Please seek a trusted therapist so that you can talk through your options and have support.

I was in 9th grade, and my best friend, Ian, and I did cross country together. It was a rainy day so coach had us run on the indoor track in circles. We both look at each other and both say ""I gotta take a dump.""  We snuck away from practice and went to the locker room. Ian got in first and the other stall had some sort of hellish shitticane going on there in which no one would dare use even in an emergency.  So, you know that one pair of shoes in the locker room that have been in there forever and no one had ever claimed them nor have they moved in what seemed like an eternity? Well, I just had to shit.

I proceed to open the tongue of the shoe and drop the single fattest and longest turd into these mid top nikes. He comes out, and I have this shit eating grin. I told him to go over to where the shoes were and he goes ""aw dude gross, that's sick!!"" (sick as in gross). We had our laughs and returned to practice and never thought anything of it.

9cptbm,"One college summer break 8 years ago my friends and I were bored. We remembered a demonstration from a high school science class of a ""Solar Balloon"". This was just a really thin black plastic bag you'd fill with air, seal, and then set out in the sun. The sun would heat the air in the black bag and the bag would become buoyant and float.      We had the idea to find the cheapest/thinnest black plastic trash bags available and combine a bunch of them to make a huge balloon. We spent a few days driving around to Walmarts and dollar stores trying different brands to find the thinnest possible plastic bag and thinnest tape which would work the best. Finally we took a number of them, cut off the bottom ends, and taped them together into a huge balloon which we filled up with a leaf blower and then tied the end. After sitting out in the sun for a half hour or so we had done it!      [This is a picture a friend had taken as it was just becoming buoyant.](https://imgur.com/1kMEbpm)    We had to mess around with how the tape was sealing the bags to use as little of it as possible as the weight of the tape added up and made the balloon harder to float.

One of the guys had even played xbox with me while the other guy was alone with my mom in her room. As a kid I didn't know what they were doing.

I remember other instances of mom having me and my brother in the car when she went to pick up men I didn't know and bringing them home. &#x200B; I don't know how much time passed but I remember dad asking me if any strange men came over the house at night saying that my brother told him about them.

So talking about it would only bring back painful memories. &#x200B; I just really hate my mom sometimes and get these angry suspicions that she is still cheating when there is no evidence of it, but I hide it well. I blame her for my fear of being cheated on, but I still love her. So I just keep it inside. &#x200B; Edit: Thank you so much everyone for your kind words. I was really afraid I would just see a bunch of posts shaming my mom and calling her names, which is not what I wanted to see.  I know what she did was awful but I still love her.","TBH, I think the dad knew after your brother told him about these encounters. There is really no reason for a kid to make stuff like that up. If I was the dad in this situation, I’d simply won’t push and interrogate the kids. Probably your parents talked and just moved on. Affairs happen. Not every affair ends in divorce.

9f8g7q,"I may get downvoted for this but here goes. My husband loves IPA beer but it makes him smell so bad it's not even funny. It just reeks out his pores and will actually make our sheets and his pillow case smell bad. It also really doesn't matter what brand or how high quality it is, whatever is in IPA doesn't mix with his body chemistry.  His favorite beer by far is from a local brewpub. I'd say he was drinking about 2/3 growlers of their IPA a week. I finally couldn't take it anymore so one day at lunch I went in and asked to speak with the owner. He is a very super cool guy and he said that he also can't stand IPAs because it's the reason so many bad breweries have been able to open because IPAs take very little skill to make and people often cover up mistakes with the intense flavors. So he and I worked out a deal that any time my husband came in, he and is workers would tell him they were out of IPA but they would offer him a more traditional lager at a discount. Our hope was that eventually he'd lose the taste for IPA and stop stinking up our house. I even offered to work out a deal with the owner that I pay him whatever he was losing in the discount and he told me not to worry about it.  So it's actually worked. I've tricked my husband's taste buds into liking lighter beer and he seems to be past the disgusting IPA stage and he smells way better.  Suck it shit beer.

9h7g7r,"I'm in my later 20's. My wife is still in her early 20's. We currently have no kids, two dogs and have been married for only 7 months. My initial plan was to be married for two years and get established in our jobs, which are fairly new, then start trying for kids. I really do want them and I've expressed my concern to her, but she doesn't want to hear any of it. This person got pregnant, this person is due anytime, her friends from high school/college are having kids, etc. She wants a baby. We dated for a total of three years before we got married. The first two were a sex filled romp. My wife is a freak in bed and she sure showed it. After we got engaged, it slowed down a bit and she wasn't as freaky, but it was still satisfying. Now that we're married, she doesn't want anything intimate unless we are trying. If I say, ""Hey, wanna have sex"", or even attempt foreplay, she brushes me off...but...if I say, ""hey, let's make a baby!"" she turns back into freak mode. My wife is one of those that thought if a guy ejaculates inside a woman, she will become pregnant no matter what. She didn't realize about ovulation and peak times and whatnot. So, after she learned about it, she asked me to download the *Flo* app and chart her cycles for her. I did, but manipulated the whole thing. When she thinks she's ovulating, she's not and the chances of her getting pregnant are slim to none.  Sometimes I'll tell her that her ""peak"" day(highest chance of getting pregnant) is coming up in a few days so we should start early.

9hpsab,"This was back in... let me think, maybe 1997? I was 38 and my daughter was 18, and she was dating Harry, who was 24. I was an alcoholic and dabbled in other drugs, mostly cocaine. I was not a good person, let alone mother. Not like I was abusive to my daughter or anything but I was generally inattentive and cared more about my alcohol and drugs than her, especially in her teen years. I am 14 years sober now.  I disproved of my daughter dating harry, but I never told her why. He would flirt with me, constantly, and the age difference also creeped me out. Also, he was an alcoholic and drug user, just like me. She broke up with him over his alcoholism.  Soon after she moved away, not too far but regardless she didn't live with me anymore. Harry kept calling me and asking if we wanted to get drinks, I turned him down, but then one day he said he had a bunch of coke and I couldn't resist. He came over, we did the coke, and we ended up having sex. He was a very good looking guy. He looked A LOT like that ridiculous 80s justin beiber picture that was on the front page today, that is actually what made me think about him.  For the next few months, maybe like 3-4 months, he would sometimes come over and we would have sex and do drugs and get drunk together. Any drug addict knows what that is like to have a drug addict buddy in that way.  Then I got pregnant. I knew it was by him, I had sex without a condom a few times stupidly. I never told him I was pregnant, and I went and got the abortion and kept it a secret.  Anyways, I stopped seeing him after that, it was too weird. I also got sober, for like 4 months, before relapsing. Fast forward 2 years and my daughter contacts me and tells me that she got back with Harry, and that he is fully sober. I was mortified honestly. He was gonna tell her that we slept together, and she is going to hate me for life. They came over one day and said hi, and when my daughter was gone, Harry told me that there is no reason to tell her about what happened. I agreed.  Its been 16 years of marriage on their part. They have a kid together. Harry got cancer, then beat it. I got sober. That's basically it.  I don't see them very often, they live in texas and I live on the east coast. But whenever I do there is always that tension between me and Harry, its literally the first thing that comes to either of our minds, I can just tell. Not like sexual tension, like ""why did we have to do that? What the fuck is wrong with us?"" kind of tension.  I think about this often. Especially when I see my grandson. I always think that could have been my son if things had gone differently, but WOW what a disaster that would have been if I decided to keep that child. ","Now *this* is a confession!

I was bullied harshly in school, and had the shit beat out of me on a daily basis until I hit puberty. Then I suddenly grew into a monster. I towered over everybody at school. I also channeled my anger into working out, and became even bigger. I was a huge, ogre of a person. I hated EVERYBODY. I had so much angst built up from my own bullying. My former bullies, being the manipulative cowards that they were (I see this in retrospect, but didn't see it at the time), befriended me. And we pretty much held a reign of terror over the school. I fed on the newfound respect from my former enemies.  &#x200B; We preyed on the weak. There were about 5 nerds that I personally tormented harshly.

9kyxiz,"I was reminded of this when I read a venting post in r/dogs about a woman who restrained herself from slapping a child when the kid kicked her dog. Several years ago I was in a similar situation, and I didn’t restrain myself at all.  When I was 23, my 14 year old beagle mix was diagnosed with a fast acting cancer that had already started to spread. I’d had him since he was 1 and I made it my mission in life to keep him as comfortable and happy as I could. There was nothing he loved more than walking in the park, so I packed him up in the car and we for a short and slow walk every day.  He was the sweetest, friendliest boy so it was absolutely shocking when on one our walks, a boy we’d never seen before, who was probably 10-11 ran up to us screaming “I hate your ugly, gross dog, lady!”. My initials response was “ugh, ok, well we’re just passing by, so goodbye then”. Then the little jerk let out an inhuman screech and ran forward and kicked my dog in the stomach. My poor boy yelped and whimpered and crumpled to the ground in pain, and the kid laughed in that horribly demonic way only a child can laugh, and then reeled back to kick again. Before that moment, I had never experienced rage as an adult. I’m pretty evenly keeled person, and I’m typically a pacifist and diplomat. This was the first and only time in my life that I saw red.  Before my brain had even processed what happened I’d already lunged at the kid and sort of half grabbed half shoved him by the neck, and pushed him to the ground very hard. He immediately burst into tears, and that’s when I should have stopped. But I couldn’t stop, it was the only time in my life when I felt like I wasn’t in control of my actions. The kid was scrambling to get up and I kicked him really hard in the side, several times. Then I grabbed him by his sweatshirt hood and screamed in his face at the top of my lungs. I screamed some really horrible things at him (something like that I’d find him and kill him slowly if he ever tried to hurt another animal again), but it felt like the words were just erupting out of me with no thought or effort.  At that point the kid was ugly sobbing and apologizing and begging me to let him go, which I guess helped me to snap out of it, because I felt myself (for lack of a better description) return to my body. I felt totally numb and sort of inebriated but the rage was gone. I let the kid go, and told him to go find his mom, and hastily added “and don’t ever kick a dog again”. He ran off crying. I scooped my dog up, hustled to my car and left.  I was oddly calm. I drove to the vet and told them only that a child had kicked my dog and ran away, and I wanted to get him checked out. They checked him out and said there was no serious damage, other than the beginnings of a bruise. I drove us home, got into the shower and sobbed for hours. I had no idea until then that I was capable of doing anything like that.  I started therapy the next week to deal with the anger issues I didn’t know I had until then, and I’ve never had another issue like that. I didn’t go back to that park for years,  for fear of running into that kid again (mostly for fear that his parents would be there and get me arrested). I took Freddy to a different park (that was a little further from the house, but he actually liked it more because it had good soft dirt to dig in) until his final day on earth.  I think about that kid sometimes, though. I wonder how my actions impacted him. Did I scare him straight? Did I teach him to be more violent? Does he have some complex about short women now because a short woman beat him up when he was a kid? He’s gotta be at least a teenager now. I wonder how often he thinks about it, if ever. I wonder if he sees himself as being entirely the victim, or if by now he’s loved and lost a pet, and understands the drive behind what I did.

9mv5ru,"Title basically. This was a few years ago. I use to be friends with this girl in college (we'll call her Jackie) and were both pursuing our nursing degrees. We got along really well for a majority of the school year except towards the end. I began liking a boy, who she knew about, and then had sex with him anyway. We both talked about it and she understood how hurt I was and promised never to do something like that again.  Fast forward to nearing our graduation (like 1 year later), another boy I had been seeing for a while who came to our place for a pre-party. We all left at the same time (Jackie and I shared an apartment) and then went to the party.Jackie left and so did the boy (I figured they were both going to campus together since we had apartments next to eachother) and so I just stayed with the rest of my group. I came back, only to hear them having sex...I was devastated. He was my boyfriend, and I finally thought I found the one. It was a few short months, yes, but still, he was so sweet and I thought he cared about me). I knew I needed to get back at her for hurting me, and here is how I did.  We both smoked marijuana...heavily. After graduation, I still was pretending to like her. We both moved back home (which ironically was close to each other) and began working at the same hospital as nurses (different units). Our hospital had a **strict** drug policy which forbid any drug use. I stopped smoking, but she didn't. I would always convince her to and I'd just have a drink or pretend to take a hit from it. Sometimes I'd even 'fake roll' one and just smoke a cigarette while she smoked marijuana. After about two months of me stopping marijuana, and her continuing, I left an anonymous note on my managers desk saying ""Jackie is high now. You need to test her."" She would never go to work high, just smoke a day before her shift-she was never ever inebriated while working.  ...well...about 1 hour later occupation health came and **everyone** (doctors, techs, unit clerk, cleaning staff, etc) was tested on the unit (to prevent any discrimination), and if you left, you would be breaking policy and risk termination. Jackie immediately texted me after freaking out in the break room that she needed to talk. I ran up and faked to have no idea and was comforting her saying it'd be fine and nothing to worry about. 1 week later: **terminated.** She violated the drug policy which results in immediate termination. She was blacklisted at the hospital and all nearby ones as well. Because of the state I was in too (NY), at the time it was a controlled substance, which made it especially bad. We worked at that hospital for only a few months. Now? She has only been able to work in a local office as a nurse/receptionist, making about 1/4 of what she could've been. No other job will hire it. (Maybe one a few states away would, but I am not sure). Do I regret this? Yes. I was an asshole and fucked up, bad. Will I ever tell her? Probably not. But is karma a bitch? Certainly.","So just for the record, according to OPs post history, she hasnt graduated yet, is still in college. She also has extreme asthma, despite formerly being a heavy marijuana smoker. Even pointed out that her housing has been a problem because of marijuana smoke in the dorm. I think this is revenge fantasy porn. OP, sorry your boyfriend cheated on you, but it wasnt your friends fault, it was your boyfriends. Also, nobody who smokes weed would fall for the ""fake roll"" thing, tobacco and marijuana have a completely different smell and you can see the difference between the burn.

But with the family and friends I have on my side, I won't be for long. For all the folks wishing me luck, sending me messages, and generally showing empathy to a man undeserving: thank you from every piece of my heart. Sometimes the internet's not such a bad place. As for updates. My brother has expressed that he is willing to post them from this account over the next few weeks as the process works itself out. So it won't be me directly, but they'll be here. Finally. To answer a couple common questions: 1. ""How did you make it seven years?"" I didn't break the law, kept my head down, and was, for all intents and purposes, barring the absconding, a model citizen. No one ever had a reason to question me. 2. ""Why not stay on the run?"" This may be hard for someone on the outside to understand, but the life I currently live is a life of constant fear. A purgatory. A half life. My daughter has made me see that I need more. I need freedom. Which may seem contrary to going to prison, but jail or prison is just the first step in a longer game plan. One that sees me as a REAL model citizen, the best father I can be, and Lord willing, the best husband a woman could hope for. 3. ""What were your crimes?"" Like I've mentioned, I am actively avoiding specificity, but the long and short is I committed several crimes over several weeks, and it culminated in me fighting a cop and hurting him when he tried to arrest me. 4. ""Have you ever talked to the cop and apologized?"" I have not. I hope to one day, but first thing first is getting my shit together. An apology from an on the run convicted criminal doesn't mean much. 5. ""What about your wife/woman?"" I am hopeful. She seems committed to helping me through this. I hope to make us work. But if time has other plans she will always have my love and respect. Both as the mother of my child and the woman who helped me to grow into the kind of man that's ready to face his failures and grow as a human, and a parent. That's all I got for now. I might add a final note before I go in tomorrow. If not my brother will update when new news is to be had. UPDATE: this is my final update for a while. In 20 minutes my attorney is driving me to county. I'm currently holding my daughter while my lady hammers out some details with the lawyer. Thank you all for the well wishes. As strange as it is Reddit has given me more of the strength I need to do this. The internet sometimes comes through for you. Excuse me for now. I need to cuddle my daughter for the last few minutes I can...",My father went to prison when I was a few months old. He didn't get out till I was 11. My mom never let me see him. I saw a few pictures but didn't even know who he was till I was 7. He is now a huge part of my life and I love him to death. He sent me cards every month so I would never feel like I wasn't important. Just get this behind you. She will forgive you. ,10094
9on2z9,"I've always hated reading long texts when I'm not interested on the topic. So, when I was in high school and the teachers gave an assignment related to reading (like in English class, when we had to read Macbeth, Of Mice And Men, etc). I would just read chapter summaries and do the respective essays and tests (my lowest grade was like a B). And so on. Or this other time when we were watching a documentary for social studies class and the teacher told us that we had to write the key ideas in a piece of paper. I remember that it was boring, so I was just on my phone and every once in a while I would write some ideas that I heard. I didn't write more than ten, and when my teacher read it he said ""this is one of the best summaries I've read"". Then, someone told me that this would not work in college when you really had to study. Nope, still works. I'm taking a communication class where we have to read a long and boring textbook and write a one page summary in our own words. For this, I just google the title of every chapter and get some ideas from different websites and write my summary. So far, I've earned A's in these summaries, and another A in the first exam. Sometimes I regret it because I know I'm not really learning anything, but I believe studying shouldn't be the only thing you care for in life, so I'm not going to stress out about the classes I don't like (and that are not required for my degree) and I'm going to continue doing this for as long as I can. EDIT: I obviously don’t do this on my math courses. In fact, math is the only homework that I really try and without looking at my notes","They only time this may be a detriment to you is when you start taking classes directly related to your major and are out of your intro courses. Otherwise, work smart. Not hard. ",3693
9pg8og,"Reposting this here instead of in r/offmychest, cause this sub seems more fitting. I have been browsing offmychest and this subreddit for a few hours now, since I couldn't sleep. Figured I might aswell chip in my story, since I don't often talk about this irl for obvious reasons. Please mind that English is not my native language. As you can guess from the title, it's not a very happy story. Buckle up, this'll be a long ride. tldr at the bottom. &#x200B; My parents broke up very early, I grew up with my mom. My dad wasn't really present throughout my childhood. My mother has had a drinking problem for as long as I can remember. She had a rough upbringing and could only vent her frustration when she was drunk. The way things went down was always the same. Around once a month she comes home late, waking me in the middle of the night. From then on it's a shitshow. She starts yelling, spitting at me, beating me. Smears her snot in my face or on my bedsheets and makes me sleep in there. One second she yells in my face that she hates me, that my father and grandma hate me, that it's all my fault and in the next second she starts crying and says that she loves me, emotional rollercoaster. This always goes on for the whole night. I don't remember too much but ironically the most prominent memories are the ones from when I was very young, maybe around 5 or something. One night I had to stand facing the wall the whole night while she screamed at me. I was so tired since I was just a little kid but everytime I tried to sit down she would hit me. Sometimes I had to do squats while pulling at my ears, making me look really stupid. Apart from the fact that it was humiliating, she made me do them until I collapsed from the pain, then she shouted at me to continue. A weird thing she did was she frequently pretended to choke to death in the middle of a rant. She then lay there motionless for 10 minutes straight. As a 5 year old, I was completely in panic and had no idea what to do. I tried to wake her up but she didn't respond at all until she suddenly jerked up and resumed shouting at and hitting me for ""not helping her"". Luckily she stopped pulling that one once she saw that I got too used to it. As I got older she got more and more violent, but the only times I was really scared for my life was when she got the kitchen knife while fighting with her (now ex) fiancée. Luckily no one was ever stabbed. I could go on and on but you get the idea. I never got any help because I was so used to all this stuff. And ofc my mother told me to never tell anyone. Whenever I brought her bahaviour up in the next morning she claimed that she couldn't remember, said that I'm overexaggerating things, or outright claimed I was making stuff up. Sometimes she apologized ""I will never do it again, honey"". I stopped listening after a while. School was pretty shit aswell. I had no social skills because I preferred to play video games all day. I was a weird and misbehaving kid, so I was bullied a lot. Also I was too afraid to stand up for myself, because I only knew punishment. The fact that we often moved didn't help much. All in all I went to 10 different elementary schools across 4 different countries. Poland was especially shit. Not the country, you Polish folk are nice people :) but living with this rich alcoholic dude whom my mother constantly fought with was. Thank god that episode only lasted a few months. Anyway, I digress. Unsurprisingly I became depressed at some point and have been ever since. don't know when exactly, I think it was somewhere around 10 years old. This torture went on for many years. &#x200B; Then it happened. She came home drunk one morning morning while I was getting ready for school. She didn't get much of a reaction out of me these days and didn't seem to like it. As mentioned in the title I was 15 years old at that time and getting physically stronger than her and I was used to the shouting. Also I was basically dead inside. I was completely nonchalant when she started her rant. Then she said something about my ex gf. It wasn't really all that bad but it was a weak spot for me since she recently broke up with me, it was my first relationship and I was the one who fucked it up. It was the last straw. All these fucking years of constant abuse and neglect unloaded themselves in one moment. Humans can be animals. It was like watching a movie from a 3rd person perspective. I had no control whatsoever. I screamed while grabbing her throat and squeezing with all I had. I somehow strangled her across my whole room onto the bed. My big and scary mother whom I was always afraid of wasn't able to fight back against my rage. Not one bit. Now thinking back she even looked kinda scared. So she was on her back on my bed and I was standing above her, squeezing her throat. I have no idea how long that went on, maybe a few seconds, maybe half a minute. Everything felt so surreal. At some point my brain kicks in: ""do you really want to do that?"" I get ahold of myself and I let go of her. fucking mistake. &#x200B; She instantly grabs a chair and starts swinging at me full force. I mean yeah, I technically tried to kill her but now I just want to get out of this alive. I block it and it fucks up my arm. Then she fucking bites me in the very same arm jesus fucking christ that hurt. The bite later swole to the size of a ping pong ball. Anyway I manage to get the hell out of that appartement but now I run the risk of freezing to death since we had winter and I'm wounded with nothing on me but my pyjamas. I encounter a neighbour and ask him to call the cops. I tell them what happened (leaving out the strangling part) and after they see my wounds they inform my mother that I'm being taken into care. My mom makes a pathetic attempt of trying to put on an act but snaps halfway through and bites an officer, gets wrestled down and arrested on the spot (It was honestly hilarious in hindsight, she played the victim and called me a traitor for calling the cops on her) but got out later on. She had to pay a huge fine though for attacking an officer. &#x200B; I moved out into government care. It was honestly cool. By the end of age 15, I had my own appartement for free rent, 400€ per month to do with whatever the hell I want and social workers that were pretty decent people (Kudos to German CPS). However shit caught up with me, my depression worsened badly, I started to drink a lot and later that year I tried to drown myself. That was rock bottom for me. I've had bad phases since then, there were nights where I wanted to die, nights where I wanted to pay my mother a visit and get my revenge and nights where I didn't want anything at all. However all in all life's been gradually improving for me. Slowly but steadily. The older I got, the more self-aware I became about my behaviour so I stopped getting bullied. Also I learned to stand up for myself, that was helpful. However I still ended up quitting school at some point. I realized I can't force myself to do something I despise for even a second. I just stood up in the middle of class and went ""fuck it"". After that I tried a bunch of different jobs but none of them worked for me. However I found my true passion. I love making music, and I'm currently putting all my energy into becoming a successful musician. I no longer care if I might fail, it's really liberating! My relationship with my mother has been improving steadily aswell. Boy it was hard at first, and I made sure to let her know how much I hated her for what she did, but she finally, truly admitted her mistakes and quit drinking. It was easier after that. I could start expressing and letting go of my hatred in a healthy way. She really made an effort to better herself. I also apologised for what I did that day and she forgave me. I wish I could tell you a happy ending to that part of the story but sadly my mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia two years ago. The stress of coming to terms with what she did and the loneliness probably broke her. Sometimes I think about what I could have done differently. She knows that i still haven't forgiven her and am still suffering every day because of what happened. But I can't change that. I told her it needs time. It's been only six years since the day police took me. She's back in her home country now with her family, they're taking care of her. Thank god for that. The last two years were a huge burden. At one point she was so thin that you could see the shape of her skull, all while having that giddy delusional smile on her face. Horrifying. Well, there it is. The story of how I tried to kill my mother. I apologise for the swearing, I got a bit emotional while writing this. Granted, a lot of bad stuff happened in the past but it made me the way I am today, and I'm glad for that. I learned many things and I wouldn't trade that for the world. People become who they are based on circumstances, but it is always in our power to change our fate. Don't hate them, no matter what they do to you. Cruel people are often hurting inside. Instead encourage them to be the best they can be! Life's too short to be unhappy. Strive towards your goals and never settle for less! It could always be your last day on earth, you literally have nothing to lose! Life's definitely not fair. Cherish what you've been given and make the best of it. Suicide will prevent you from ever becoming happy. However I realize I'm still only 21 years old and have a lot to learn. I plan on doing so. I don't want to live a life full of hatred and regret, I want to be able to love and trust somebody again. I want to get married, have atleast 3 children, become a successful musician, travel the world, stuff like that. Just be happy. I know I'll get there, one day at a time. *Tl;dr - I was constantly abused by my mother and bullied in school since my early childhood and snapped one day, almost strangling my mother to death. Police took me in and after a while things got gradually better between us. I've pretty much made up with her. Now I try to live my life as best as I can.* &#x200B; Phew, I did it! It feels like I wrote up an entire novel. Contrary to my expectations, I actually feel better now! If anyone made it 'til here, thank you for reading! :) &#x200B; EDIT: I'm waking up this morning and Jesus Christ this blew up... I've read some comments and want to thank you guys so much for your kind words!! They mean a lot to me! I'll try to answer some comments later if there are any quesions. Also people have been asking me about my music. I prefer not to disclose anything here, I don't want to turn this into an advertisement for my songs. :)  EDITEDIT: I'm at a loss for words, man. Just thank you all so much for your kind words, even those of you who had critical things to say! It's just surreal. These comments are coming in faster than I can reply but there is something I wanted to adress, since it popped up a few times. I understand that a lot of emotions can be stirred up by such a delicate topic, especially if you experienced abuse yourselves. Maybe it's partly my fault, because I focused too much on the negative aspects of our relationship. If so, then I apologize. But please, if you can, don't write hateful comments about my mother. Some things did go very wrong, yes. But she also did the best she could in raising me. There was always food on the table, she tried showing affection in her own way, she cared for my interests and education etc. and I firmly believe that she has always loved me. She just couldn't always express it, as she's as much a victim of abuse as I am. That's why it hurts me seeing comments like ""you should have killed her"" We have to be better than that! I know we can! So I just want to make it clear that even after what happened I love her. After all, she is my mom.","You know what, stories like this always make me wonder why having mental illness or trouble is characterized as being weak. You went through so much. You pushed so hard. You're stronger than me and everyone else I know. Thank you for still being here today.",2110
9ps7y9,"I was a heroin addict in the lower east side of Manhattan in the 1990s as a teen. I got clean at 21 years old after years of abuse. I got married at 26 to my amazing and beautiful wife. She knows I was an addict.  I spent all these years not even really thinking that much about the concept of relapsing. It had been *so long*. I still thought about it, but with marriage and my kids and everything the thought of it was just so ridiculously out of sight to even consider trying it again.  3 weeks ago, it was my friends birthday. He is 4 years younger than me so of course he wants to go to some cool hip sketchy bar/club thing in bushwick.  I got drunk, really drunk. I hadn't really drank much at all in the past few years so my tolerance was way lower than expected. There was a dealer outside and a few other junkies nearby. I don't even fully remember what happened, I just remember going with them, abandoning my friend at the bar (it was like 1am anyways), and going to some apartment and shooting up. I spent the night there, then all the way until noon the next day. I had 10 missed calls.  I panicked when I came out of my daze. I told my wife I had gotten way too drunk and was puking and my phone was out of battery so I stayed at Charlies house. She was disappointed I didn't tell her but also thought it was funny because she used to tease me for not being able to handle my liquor. This was a ""I told you so"" moment, she had told me not to drink too much before I went to the bar. She wasn't even in new york, she was at a summer house with the kids in Massachusetts.  I spent the next 4 days until they got back just... riddled with anxiety, urges to get more heroin, horrific mind zaps (I dont even know what to call them). It was, in some ways, worse than my withdrawal symptoms when I first was an addict. Not because of the physical feeling, but the horrible mental feeling of what I was possibly giving up, my wife and kids. I wanted to fucking get more so badly. I left my house to find heroin 4 fucking times. 4 times, I gave up to get more, but wasn't able to find any and snapped back to reality and went back home. I still thank FUCKING GOD I did not somehow run into some street dealer during those 4 times. I would have absolutely done it.  I feel like everything I thought about myself, that I was strong, that my addiction was behind me, that I had beat heroin... it was all gone. I am not going to say I am back at square one or anything, I am not. But I feel like something inside of me has reset. My unwavering strength against addiction was broken at the slightest temptation. I still am weak. Heroin is so, so much stronger than me. Its truly unbelievable how much stronger it is than me.  When I was young, my aunt had cancer. She beat it. Then it came back soon after, and she beat it again. It didn't come back, and we loved how strong she was for fighting her cancer and that she had overcome it. She lived with us. I remember her feeling of strength after her 2nd year of not having cancer, her 3rd year, her 6th year.... it finally felt like it was gone for good. Her thinking ""its finally behind me now, its a part of my past"", and then it just fucking came back. 9 years after her first diagnosis, it came back and killed her. I remember her feelings and how she felt about it. So many years after she thought it had gone away.  That is how I feel. Like a cancer which I thought I got rid of a decade ago just showed back up on my screening.  The first 5-6 days after I tried it that time outside the bar were the worst. My kids and wife have come back. The urges mostly went away the second I saw my kids. I hugged them so damn hard.  And I never told my family what happened, nor will I ever. My wife never understood that side of me, she met me 5 whole years after I was clean. I just cannot have her know, ever.  I won't do it again. I am planning on not drinking to excess like that again, except maybe in very specific situations like at the summer house where there is no option of drugs. I mean, not like I WANT to get drunk again like that, but just in case I ever want to get loose? I am never doing that in the city again.  I am still about 90%+ sure that I won't ever touch heroin again. I am still positive in myself about it. Its just... it used to be 99% sure. That is what fucking terrifies me.  I said heroin is stronger than me. It is absolutely stronger than me. But the reason I won't ever do it again is that it isn't stronger than my family, my wife and kids. I don't care about how good it feels, I will not subject my wife and children to me being an addict. I would rather just kill myself than that. ",I'm proud of you,4756
9squx1,"Every year at the start of November I book a lodge in the middle of nowhere for a week. I am 32 years old and have schizophrenia and have done this for the past 6 years. I'm on treatment (medication and therapy) all year except the 3 days leading up to my adventure and for the week itself. I do this without anybody knowing because I know I'd get a lecture which I completely understand why. Usually my psychosis and Break from reality is very negative and scary that's why I comply with medication on the most part. But every time I've taken lsd I've had nothing but fantastic, intriguing and amazing experiences. I love taking it and stepping into a different reality not the reality I live in or the reality I face when psychotic, a reality where everything is beautiful and bliss. The things I take back from these experiences has helped me so much. Obviously I understand the risks of taking lsd as a schizophrenic, on my trip I'm sure to bring high dose antipsychotics and sedatives if I ever need to use them. But when I take the drug I find myself in a place like no other, everything has meaning and beauty. Colours and wildlife are fascinating to look at. The adventures that happen are incredible, I really find my true self and are content with life. I'll never tell anybody I know about this because they wouldn't understand and I'll never share the experience with anybody else because this is really a time to find me and experience paradise.","not schizophrenic but i've found occasional hallucinogen use in controlled situations helps my self auditing and helps me sort intrusive thoughts from valid concerns. obviously i dont know your situation, but you do, better than anyone else, and since you're taking a ton of precautions o make sure no-one is in danger, i'd humbly suggest you file this under ""necessary self care"" rather than ""sin to confess"" <3",2519
9tvxvm,"My Aunt is a poisonous woman. Our whole family doesn’t talk to her. She’s done things in the past you wouldn’t believe. So she left our lives years ago. Recently she returned out of the blue at my moms house. My mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. My mom and aunt never got on. My mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance.  My Aunt was nasty and would hurt people’s feeling intentionally for no reason. She never had a partner or kids. She isolated herself from everyone. My Gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. We all genuinely think there’s something physiologically wrong with her.  So back to where I was going with this....one morning I was at my moms house. Just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. So I opened it and there she was. She walked in, she looked like she had took drugs. She looked dead behind the eyes. I tried to stop her but she pushed me down. I honestly don’t know why she came to my moms house out of everyone. I quickly got up and she went into the kitchen she startled my mom and punched her in the face, my mom didn’t even have a chance to blink before she hit her. She went down like a ton of bricks. My heart felt like it had been sucked through into my stomach when I seen it. Something came over me, I don’t know if it was anger or adrenaline, but I ran up behind her and grabbed her hair and I dragged her out onto the back lawn and I bashed her face about 15 times, blood was everywhere. Thankfully no one seen me or I might not of been writing this right now. I got up and I left her there. I went to check my mom, she was in a lot of pain. I looked back out the window and she was gone.  We told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. I’m still so hurt and angry as I write this. But I also feel tremendously guilty and upset that I done that to her because I’ve never fought anyone and I’m not a fighter at all, but something came over me and I snapped.  I can’t get over it for some reason. It just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. God forbid she had a weapon that’s truly scary to think about. We didn’t call the police. As I assaulted her badly and didn’t want it to bounce back on me. That’s another thing I feel ashamed about. But should I feel bad or not? I need others opinions as I’ve been bottling this up for a while.   My Gran was devastated, she just wanted her daughter back but from a young age she took to drugs, spent time in prison and amount of other things. You can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be saved.

9xfbhb,"Many moons ago I was working for a large technology company. It was common practice for managers on the same team to exchange some sort of token holiday gift just before Christmas - something under $20.   One of these managers was a very nasty woman who was quietly bullying some of her employees and one of the other managers on our team. We were trying to deal with her through the proper channels but, the holidays sprang up in the meantime.   When the holidays came around, I bought a case of a nice red wine that I enjoyed and prepped them all with giftbags. Except one bottle - the bottle for the nasty manager.   I took that bottle and spent about two weeks heating the bottle and chilling the bottle by wrapping it in a particularly warm heating pad and standing it on top of my old apartments hot water heater for one or two hours then sticking it in the freezer until the bottle was cold to the touch. My goal was to ruin the wine, turn it to vinegar.   The holidays came and I gave my fellow managers their gift wine and we all headed out of the office for a few days for company-wide OOO.   When we came back everyone was talking about how wonderful the wine was. Except the nasty manager, who was surprised everyone loved it. She was going on about how nasty it was and how bad it smelled and how she couldn't even drink it.   It was intended as a harmless prank but, when she was fired a few days later for bullying people, she exploded and mentioned my ""shitty wine"" in her tirade as she threw things around the office on her way out the door.

a1jccq,"UPDATE: A lot of people were asking for an update so here it is. I wrote up a long ass apology letter that I wanted to read to my brother. I waited until he got home and got into bed for the night. I knocked on his door and he was so fucking excited that it was me. I couldn't even get through the first few words. I started crying after saying ""I wanted to say I'm really sorry"" and just couldn't get through it. I just got into bed with him and laid down next to him. He hugged me really tight and said ""I missed you buddy"". I fucking lost it. I never cried that bad before. He just hugged me for a long time until I calmed down. We didn't talk much. He started crying for a bit too. It was the first time in a long time we just hugged. After half an hour I got up and gave him a kiss and he told me he was so happy. Why didn't I do this earlier, fuck. I thought I could I try apologizing properly again tomorrow. I left him the note to read anyway. I am feeling very hopeful right now and a lot of pressure in my heart is gone. I swear to God and on my own life I will never treat my brother so badly again. I have been working part-time for the past year and I was saving some money so my brother and my mom could go on a trip to a place he really wanted to go to. But I think I will take my brother myself instead (when I turn 18). I also realized that I need to have a relationship with my brother where I am not just taking care of him. It needs to be like a normal brother relationship. Like going for movies and stuff. It's going to take some time for me to fix the mess I created though. I'm just lucky my brother is amazing. I received a lot of messages. I appreciate everyone for their input and I did read them all even if I didn't reply. Thanks everyone.   My actual post: [Remorse]  I know this will get a lot of hate and yes I deserve it. I am not looking for any validation or forgiveness. I know I am a piece of human trash. I just need to get this out. I have a brother who is two years older then me. He has suffered from a condition since birth that forces him to be in a wheelchair anytime he is out of bed. He cannot use his arms that well either. We used to have a great relationship until I turned 11 and I really started resenting the amount of attention he took from my parents. And how much stress he put them under. I had to constantly help him, change him, feed him. I hated it. There was a few years in his life when he so mean to my parents and it really made me resent him more. I realize now that I had no right to judge him and I will never know how difficult life is for him. I stopped hanging out with him and made more friends at school. I would tell my family all the fun I was having at school during dinner to make him feel bad. I started barely talking to him or acknowledge his presence. He would get frustrated to the point of tears to get my attention. It started escalating two years ago when I would purposely turn off the wifi and unplug the tv every time we had to leave the house so my brother could do nothing but sit in his wheelchair. I would purposely delete his favorite saved shows on the DVR. I would make fun of his speech. Push things just out of his reach. I would act disgusted when I had to change or bathe him. It always made him feel bad and he would apologize. I made my own brother apologize for taking a dump. What the fuck is wrong with me? But my fucking saint of a brother never told my parents. And he never let me have it. Three weeks ago, he was trying to talk to me non-stop and I was just ignoring him. I got annoyed and wheeled him against his wishes to the backyard and placed him under an umbrella and went back inside. I fell asleep and realized I left him out there for three hours. When I went to bring him back inside he was in tears and wouldn't look at me. He was humiliated.  I have always felt guilty about how I treated my brother all these years but my anger towards him overpowered it. But seeing that look on his face affected me in a way that was different from before. I stopped all the bullying after that day. I couldn't even look him in the face I was so ashamed. Last Sunday my brother told me he was glad I was his brother and friend. I couldn't even respond. I went to my room and cried. I'm fucking crying again typing this all out. When did I become an evil trash human being? Fuck. I'm 17 and he's 19 now. I know there is nothing I can do to make up for the past 6 years. My brother will be returning with my mom from a specialist appointment tonight. I'm going to apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness tonight. I want to start being being a fucking decent brother to him again. I am a healthy guy with no issues who chose to bully his only brother for something that wasn't even his fault. I am so ashamed of myself.",It’s not too late to make it up to him. EDIT 2: rip my inbox. Just one simple sentence. Thanks for the silver and the gold,6904
a3zopc,"For back round, I'm 25 years old. Female. I work in a really great environment. It pays alright but overtime and bonuses help me get by mostly. I live with my mom and brother, not rent free though. I pay half the rent, buy food etc, pay me and my moms car insurance. I help her out alot. My dad was always in and out the picture. He was recently living with us but he left after a big fight he and my mom had. But even when living with her, he never helped out. My brother is 14 and the bright light in my life, he real life keeps me here, he keeps me sane. I love him with all my heart. He's so smart. Gets all good reports from all his teachers. I help out a lot with him as well. My mom appreciates it very much. I don't have much, but I am so grateful for what I do have. My mom and I live in the projects, but its our home. We struggle at times but we make it work. I am currently saving up to get a place of my own though. Though it will become harder I'm getting to that age where it's time to be on my own. I love to sew and crochet, In the winter of 2017 I began crocheting scarves and hats, before I was making them for babies, now I make them for adults. I live in NY. The city is a very big area for individuals in need. So every winter I go out there and hand them out. I get some nice reactions, then I get some good ones. Overall, even though my life could be better, I am so thankful for everything I have. &#x200B; When I was 24 I began taking sleeping pills, I noticed that they kinda fade me out especially at night when I cant sleep. Before it was just to go to bed. I currently work Monday to friday. My previous job I worked 12 hour days so I got 3 days off. after a few months I started buying more bottles of pills. I would take them as soon as I got off of work and in my car, by the time I got home around 8:30PM, I would shower then knock out. The next morning I would wake up around 10AM, and I would take more pills. This went on for months. My mom became increasingly worried about me. Thinking I was depressed because I would stay in my room all day. Telling me I seem so withdrawn. I told her that I'm fine and work was just really busy. I do self harm but I stopped once I started taking the sleeping pills. Idk, I just love how they fade me out, one minute im wide awake, the next minute im laying down struggling to keep my eyes open. I cant explain how that drowsy feeling feels so good. I am a hypocrite however. &#x200B; I dont smoke or drink. I don't however put on a facade that I'm some anti substance person. We all have our outlets for dealing with our shit. But I tell people that my outlets are crafts. painting, sewing, writing, reading. I mean, they help, but sleeping pills are much better. I pay 4 bucks for a 40 capsule bottle of a quick getaway. over the last year I have become increasingly dependent on them though. on my payday I'll go to 5 different stores just so I dont look suspicious buying a bunch of bottles at once. I can go through 2 bottles in 2 days. but I have also stopped cold turkey a few times. In october I took a whole bottle in the san of 12-14 hours and I wasn't tired, I couldn't see. even with my glasses on I was in bed looking at my phone waiting to get tired and everything became blurry. I ignored it but then I was falling in and out of sleep when I started seeing figures moving. It was really scary but I tried to ignore it. When that wasn't working I got up and my body felt like jello, its like my heart was beating manually, I couldn't talk without breathing in between each word.  Noone was home thankfully so I went to the bathroom and tried to throw the pills up, it barley worked. That was the first time I was afraid for my life so I did call 911 and went to the hospital.  &#x200B; Which turned out to be waste. I've been through this before (with a suicide attempt) taking sleeping pills and gashing my wrist wide open. I bled, so much, but I was still here. I sat in my car for an hour before I tried to clean myself up, it didn't work so I called 911 & told them what happened. The psych ward isn't fun. I knew that If i told the emt I took a bottle of sleeping pills I'd be on suicide watch so I lied and told the doctor that idk why my vision was blurry. This was a wakeup call for me and I stopped. but then I started again in mid november. I never considered myself an addict but now I realize how angry and irritable I am when I don't have any sleeping pills. And when I don't have any money I'll take pain killers in hope that I'll fade out. it doesn't work. I had 4.70 to my name after paying all the bills and I spent it on a store brand bottle of gel caplets. they only have 20 pills. So i've been up since 4am laying down staring at the ceiling and watching my hands tremor (happens after a binge). I can stop but I'll feel sad if I have too. Not even have too. Just not get that drowsy hard to stay awake feeling. It's my get away & as long as I go to work everyday and pay my bills, I don't feel like I'm hurting anyone. I know I'm hurting myself. But I just don't feel like I have a purpose in being here. 11 years strong going to therapy, 2 years strong being on zoloft for ptsd and anxiety.  &#x200B; I dont have a bad life, maybe not knowing what my path (dreamwise) contributes to feeling purposeless these days. I put on the mask of me being a positive happy genuine kind person, and I am! This is just my dirty little secret. I hide it so well. I know I have to stop eventually and I will. I'm just afraid that I wont find another vice to keep me out until then.  Edit, sorry I don't mean to put the cliche wow I didn't think this would blow up but jeez, I'm at work right now but I read every. Single. Response.  Every single one.  Reddit is amazing. You're all amazing people, thank you for all your kind words and advice. It means the WORLD to me. I was thinking about buying some sleeping pills after work but man screw that! I am however gonna stop at the store and get my brother some snacks for his sleepover later today♥️. I keep pictures of my parents and sister/brother on my wall. Looking at them everyday keeps me moving. That love and everyday support really goes a long way. All the kind loving words on this post keep me going. I'm going to get my ass to a local and gym and look through some memberships. After reading some of the comments from former addicts/family members of addicts it's opened my eyes to the impact addiction can have on you and your loved ones. I don't wanna put my mom through that, I don't wanna put my brother thought that.  And also, I've smoked weed before, smoking just isn't my thing besides I don't wanna replace one substance with another (to all the comments about trying weed). And I take either Advil or Tylenol PM. Tbh I don't read the MG amount, I just buy them. I have dozens of empty bottles in my bedroom that I'm gonna throw away when I get home later.  Once again. Thank you so much to everyone who took the time out of their day to spread such positive words of advice and well wishes. I care deeply so much for this kind of good hearted energy. Thank you..","The dangerous thing about a dependency on most over the counter sleeping pills is that you may eventually not be able to sleep without them. Additionally, please make sure you aren't taking the kind with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, because you could be damaging your liver and kidneys that way. I know you don't want to stop, so at this point, you should look into risk-minimizing so that you don't permanently harm yourself. Even if you don't love life and don't particularly want to continue with it, I'm going to be honest with you and tell you that it sounds like your mom and brother legitimately need you, and if you love them as much as you say you do, you'll keep on keeping on until you start seeing in yourself what they see in you.",1585
a4n7uk,"  Throwaway for obvious reasons. &#x200B; This is very long, but I need to write it down. &#x200B; First  off, I'm a drug addict and I have diagnosed Major Depression Disorder  and General Anxiety Disorder. I tried to self medicate with my drugs of  choice: OTC pills, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and dextromethorphan  (Robitussin.) I could never find a consistent person to buy marijuana  from, and when I did, I never really liked the high it gave me. So, I  went with OTC drugs. They are everyone and easily accessible. I am  psychologically addicted to them. &#x200B; For  about 10 years, my drug issue has been my issue, it didn't really  effect anyone except me. My immediate family knew I was struggling with  it, but they would always support me and try to help with my recovery,  but six months ago that all changed. You should know that I deserve  everything that happened to me. &#x200B; It  started with losing my friends, I was tripping on roughly 1500mg of  dextromethorphan. I ruined a friendship with a great group of people in  the blink of an eye. While I was tripping on the 1500mg, I called and  left two very creepy and delusional social media voicemails on one of my  good friend's sister's account. She literally has no idea who I am, and  out of the blue, I leave two delusional sounding voicemails. One was,  ""Hello! I know you're an expert in the medical field and I would like to  pick your brain on an idea that could **revolutionize the medical field.** I know this place **down by the river where we can talk.**""  Thinking I left a very well thought out message while tripping out of  my mind, I hang up with a beam of self-confidence and pride that I'm  going to put this idea into action. ...but ***what the actual fuck***. I know a place *down by the river?* I have an idea that could *revolutionize the medical field*? Who the hell speaks like that to a person that has **zero**  idea who I am. In my head, I'm thinking what a great idea I put forward  and what a great restaurant down on the riverfront we could discuss it  at. It was a quaint little new-age vegan place that prides itself on  making food that tastes delicious. I'm not vegan, but I had a date the  week before with a woman who is vegan, and I figured I'd try this place.  It was actually really good. So, I thought it would be a great place to  hit up again. &#x200B; She runs to her brother,  one of my best friends, about what I said and how I sounded. He messages  me to, ""get my shit together."" And like that, boom, friendship lost;  gone, in the blink of an eye. He is one of the most laid back  individuals that rarely gets mad or pissed off. But I went too far, *I always go too far,*  I brought an unknown individual into my fucked up life, and not only  was it an unknown individual, but his sister. What the fuck was I  thinking? I wasn't thinking I'm a drug addict. The news quickly spreads  around the friend group; we are pretty tight. Or well, we **were**  pretty tight. Well actually, they still are a pretty tight group, I'm  just kicked out. And it's deserved. I deserved to lose my friends. Good  people do not hang around drug addicts and people who make awful  decisions. Good people don't enable that behavior; they leave. And  that's what they did. They left. I have no one to blame but myself. No  more invites to go bowling. No more invites to go to a BBQ. No more  invites to hang out and watch a sports game on a random night. It's  gone. And it's my fault. &#x200B; The interesting  thing at this point is that before I messaged his sister on my drug  addled, induced, insane brain, I was actually clean for about six  months. Not too bad, right? Six months is a long time to be clean for a  struggling addict. But it doesn't matter; the first of three strong  pillars that I use to lean on is reduced to nothing. I was never  ""formally"" kicked out of our friend group; it was just understood. I  know to not come around anymore. I know to seclude myself. I read  between the lines. No more chances; no more forgiveness. I crossed the  line. I went too far for the last time. And it's my fault. There's no  one to blame but me. &#x200B; Knowing this, I turn  to more drugs, I quit the Robitussin and go back to my favored drug of  choice Benadryl. I'm downing a 50 to 100 25mg diphenhydramine pills a  day. And this stuff stays in your system for **days.**  My eyes are dilated for at least two days. I'm pale, and my skin is  flushed. I can't put coherent sentences together, and I sweat like a  gross pig. Just drenched at any given moment. &#x200B; This  is where I lose my family. My family has weekly dinners on Sunday just  for us to hang out and catch up from the week. I come over stoned out of  my mind for the first time in months, and the first thing my father  says to me is, ""I'm not going to deal with you when you're like this.""  He knew immediately. Everyone knew immediately when I walked in. It was  left at that, but no one would talk to me, or listen to what I said. I  was ignored because they were **not**  going to humor a drug addict. I was ignored. I didn't even realize I  was being ignored. I kept thinking with the shit overconfidence the drug  can give you, that I was great and everything was awesome. Narrator: It  wasn't. Two weeks later I notice something, my family has a group chat  and all of a sudden they aren't talking in it anymore. I didn't realize  that they made a new one, and they made a new one because they don't  want a drug addled human around two little nieces and one little nephew.   That makes complete sense, right? Get the drug addict out. We don't  want him around. Who wants a drug addict around? No one. I only put it  together when I showed up randomly on a Sunday, and my mother and father  both say, ""what are you doing here?"" But not in the ""Oh, it's nice to  see you,"" but in the ""why are you over here stoned? We don't want you  here."" I replied with, ""It's Sunday. We get together on Sundays."" And  they both just reply, ""Oh."" The next week was my brother's birthday, and  I received a call two days before saying I was more than welcome to  come, but that I had to pay my own way at the restaurant. That's a huge  red flag. My parents **never**  make us pay when we go out to eat as a family. The reason they said I  would have to pay is because they were done supporting my addiction. If I  was going to get stoned, and come around the family blitzed out of my  mind, I was not going to get any of the perks of the family. That makes  total sense. For years they've held my hand to try and help me with my  drug issue, and they were finally done holding my hand. Something needed  to change that showed me they wouldn't deal with my shit anymore. It's a  wake-up call for me. It is deserved. I'm not blind to the consequences  I'm bearing because of the choices I made. Duh, it's obvious. It makes  sense. Maybe, to them, and finally me, it will be the only way they get  through to me. Nothing else worked, so maybe this might. On the day of  my brother's birthday, I forgot it was his birthday. Usually a text  would get sent out to the family group giving everyone a reminder, but  remember, they aren't using the family group message I'm in. They made a  separate one. They didn't even ask why I didn't show up. I brought it  up and said, ""Sorry I forgot about your birthday. No one sent me a  reminder message."" They all just kinda looked at my like, ""Oh. Okay.""  They figured I was high, and you know what, I was high. And why would  they want that around? They don't. They are finished. Today is Sunday.  They used to put out a reminder text that we will get together today.  And they will put out the text, but I won't receive it. I've lost my  family due to my own choices. I, just like my friends, will seclude  myself from them. It's my punishment; it's my Hell. I deserve it. &#x200B; Now,  I've lost my friends and my family to due my decisions. I am purposely  secluding myself because it's the apt punishment for being the person I  am. As a result, I've been doing more and more drugs. I've been going  into work the past three weeks stoned. It's obvious; and my coworkers  and boss are furious. Though they won't say it to my face. It's a great,  hardworking company, but no bullshit as well. It's literally a dream  job and position, and I'm shooting myself in the foot. My outside of  work decisions are influencing my work. Businesses don't give a shit the  reason why you're having a bad time or whatever excuse you can come out  with; it's a job and you work. They haven't told me yet, but I can feel  the dominoes falling. People are very short with me. I'm ignored. And  the big one: My boss holds monthly one-on-one meetings with her  subordinates to gauge how they are feeling and how the job is going.  Pretty nice, right? However, when I ask, she provides me **zero constructive criticism, and they are taking work away from me.**  Those are literally the two biggest red flags that an employee is about  to get fired. She also constantly talks about how, ""This job may not  fit for me,"" and how ""maybe I should look into working a different job.""  **Fuck.** However, this company  is literally my dream job. All I can do is to hopefully repair what  little reputation I have left by doing the absolute best I can and  working diligently to change my behavior. I have to get lucky; I have to  hope I'm given the benefit of the doubt. But I'm literally down to the  last straw. It's not outwardly said, but I can read the signs. If it's  one thing I know how to do, is how to read people when they are  disgusted with me and pissed at me. I'm so used to seeing those  micro-expressions on people's faces due to my addiction. Disappointment,  anger, disgust. Drug addicts know what those faces look like because  they always see those faces. But it's not like I don't deserve it. It's  absolutely unacceptable the way I'm behaving in a company that took a  chance to invest in me. I can only hope it's not too late. &#x200B; I  feel myself in my spiral downwards. I'm going to hit soon, and I'm  going to hit hard. And there is no one to blame but me. I've already  lost my friends and family. I'm most likely going to lose my job. My  depression is at an 11/10 right now and thoughts of suicide are roaring  through my brain. I'm of age. I can legally purchase a firearm. The only  thing that's stopping me is a shred of hope that forgiveness is still  possible. I need to get lucky. But there is no reason I deserve that  luck. I am what choices I make. And I've made awful choices. I deserve  the repercussions that have come and will come from the decisions I  made. &#x200B; Tl;dr: My drug addiction has  finally caught up with me. I've lost my family and friends, and I'll  probably lose my job soon. The consequences I receive are in line with  what I deserve. There is no one to blame but me.","Your family doesn't hate you. They hate what the drugs make you. You can still bounce back. But that requires the determination to actually try to get yourself on track, which is extremely hard to do before you've got rock bottom. I'll be praying for you man.",1391

Even typing words about race makes me almost light headed. I was an introvert. I was a depressed asshole of a person and it made me feel better trashing other people for something they can’t change. I apologize I do not wish to share the things I said, I can’t even bring myself to typing without feeling weak. But then late high school years, I started to meet new  diverse people. I actually went out and made friends. I realized not everyone acted the same way and there are always going to be good and bad people.

adidj1,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Since I started High School, my parents stopped checking in on my grades and their mentality was basically ""we don't care as long as you get into a good university"" and they've carried on this mentality to when I got into college and they didn't really checked on my grades and gave me free rein as long as I majored in the subjected they wanted and graduated on time with good grades. Well basically what happened was that I failed my first year and had to switch my major. I didn't tell them and they didn't ask so I thought as long as I got my shit together and not drop out I'll be fine. One day out of the blue last semester my dad asked me to write up a resume. I panicked and wrote up a resume but changed the GPA and major and made up some shit and thought I saved myself. Welp, this winter break my dad dropped it on me and told me he knows people in a big company, he gave them my resume and everything and wanted me to intern there. So I am fucked. They'll probably figure it out and let my dad know and I'll probably get disowned or something, and best case scenario they don't check and give me the job, and I have to live with the guilt that I got a job that I didn't deserve cause of nepotism, this shit is depressing as fuck and I'm typically an easy going guy but this whole ordeal is giving me anxiety like nothing else. I feel like an ass for failing and lying to my family about it and now I'm on the verge of being blown and I thought maybe making a post here will make me feel better but I honestly don't know. Edit: wow this has blown up. In all my years of Reddit, the post that gets blown up is a confession post with a throwaway account.. talk about a wake up call. Anyways, I try to read all the comments I can. Some of you tell me to play it off and fake it till I make it, some of you tell me to come clean, some tell me to just disassociate from my family and do my own thing, it seems Reddit is just as conflicted as I am.

adrzmf,"When I turned 18 I was homeless, so for 6 months I sold body as a prostitute, to get money, to get somewhere to sleep for a night, hell even to get a shower. It was the worst time of my life. I’m a man and as a male you would think wow that’s awesome you scored so much. The complete opposite in fact every day I would see myself in the mirror and cry thinking I’m not capable of love, or even getting on my own two feet. I thought to myself I cannot afford some food for the night let alone to fall in love. Having sexual experiences with someone you do not love is the most horrible feeling ever. I don’t know about anyone else but I feel like I was somehow torturing myself. It was the hardest, most demeaning, most heart reneging thing I have ever done.   Edit: I still have problems with self esteem because of this, so when my gf wants to have sex. I usually have to convince myself that she wants me for me and nothing else. Overall an 8 hour process.

ae0jlg,"I completely and 100% DESPISED homework as a kid (and about half of my teenage years). When I was in the 8th grade, we were assigned a project towards the end of the year that counted for a pretty big percentage of our overall grade. From what I can remember, it had something to do with shapes and equations - it was basically like a large project of everything we learned the whole year. I didn’t wanna do it. I worked on it a very small amount here and there, but never completed it. The math teacher collected them over a period of a few days, and then was going to spend a few more days grading them all. I played along to all of my other classmates that I turned mine in and even explained what it (maybe) looked like. The day came and she was finishing up grading all of them, and as she finished each one she gave them back, so some students had already taken theirs home. So she’s sitting at her desk and asks, “spoopypuppy, have I graded yours yet?” And I quickly replied, “Yes ma’am, you gave it back to me a couple days ago.” Some wonderful, powerful magic force was working hard that day, because all she said was, “Oh, I forgot to write your grade down. Do you remember what it was?” I didn’t want to aim too high because I knew what work I was capable of, so I simply said, “You wrote 89.” And she just wrote it down in her grade book!!!!! She didn’t question to see it again or anything!!! I couldn’t believe it worked. That was the only time that ever worked, but it worked nonetheless. I passed math because of that lie. I did learn to just suck it up and do all the work from then on. ",Teacher knew but didn't want to put up with nagging you to turn in your project and/or have to fail you. ,4993

afkjte,"When I was four years old my father and mother divorced because he cheated on her. They had a really rough divorce and had lots of fights. Eventually the divorce was settled and my mother and father could move on. My father married his mistress, who I'll call 'E' as to respect her privacy. My father was really happy with her and me and my sister got a stepbrother and two stepsisters with whom we got along really well. Skip forward two years and 'E' started acting different and so was my father. Me and my sister often couldn't visit our father because he had to 'work', whilst in reality he was free. When me and my sister were there we often weren't allowed to eat at the table, which seven year old me didn't understand. Eventually my father started becoming more distant, he didn't wish me happy birthday anymore and missed a lot of important milestones in my childhood, like learning to ride my bike or plays at school. When I was nine my sister and I could only visit four days a month and had to sleep in seperate rooms. I vividly remember that during one weekend that we were there I had accidentaly broken a glass and 'E' had turned furious. She send me upstairs and had me take my socks of which nine year old me found really weird. Then she showed me a piece of glass she held in her hand and said that this is what I deserved for my clumsyness. She pushed the shard of glass into the sole of my foot. I yelled and cried and tried to remove my leg from her grasp when I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was my father's hand, he was helping 'E' do this, I don't remeber what happened after that. 'E' also got into a huge fight with my sister and had pulled her by her hair down to the basement. After these two occasions and a lot of verbal abuse we decided to break all contact and tell our mother what had happened (we hadn't told her before because, well he was our father) . My mother knew this was serious abuse but she was too afraid to alert the police since my father had threatened her with violence before. Skip forward another five years, I was fourteen and a freshman at the same school my former stepsiblings attended. Once I saw them all the memories started rising again. My two stepsisters had become huge bullies and lots of people hated them. Me and a couple of friends decided to retaliate and secretly put small bags of marijuana in their backpacks. Apparently this had caused a huge fight in their home and my father and 'E' decided to divorce. After this 'E' got into serious financial troubles and my father became an alcoholic. Two weeks ago he was arrested for assault. 'E' has alledgedly become a prostitute and my former stepsiblings have been brought into protective custody.  This has all been my fault, it was my idea to put the marijuana in their bags, even though they hadn't done anything to me. I ruined the lives of my stepsiblings and send my stepmother and father into a downwards-spiral. Yet in some sick way I don't feel any remorse. My sister has been dealing with a severe eating-disorder after all the verbal abuse from  'E' and has been hospitalised twice. I've tried once to commit suicide because of my sexual orientation since I thought I was an abomination after 'E''s conservative Christian rants. Now me and my sister are doing better, though we still have traumas. We've thought about starting a lawsuit but because of our ages during the incidents legal advisors have adviced us to just 'move on'. Anyway... I'm in a real moral dilemma: I did something that caused horrible things, yet I don't feel any remorse, am I a psychopath?",Not at all. You were abused and made to feel horrible by these people. Nobody would blame you for not having remorse. ,3612
ai3lq4,"Back in HS we had a computer in every classroom, along with a projector which we used for giving presentations. Well I installed teamviewer on the computer (and on my smartphone) and waited for my opportunity, so when a group of girls were giving their presentation I went into a pornsite and played a video for the whole class, which everyone saw through the projector. The whole class was laughing out loud. The teacher had no idea what to do, since it was clear that the girls hadn’t done it. The headmaster took all the male students apart and threatened to suspend us all if the author didn’t turn himself in. However, as I hadn’t told anyone, I just played the fool and got away with it","This happened years ago back in middle school. My friend was trying to set up a presentation by connecting his laptop to the projector. Since it was not working at that time, we switched to a laptop that the teacher always uses to connect to the projector. It works and my friend was about to copy his file from his flash drive and that laptop’s automatic antivirus started working and scanned the drive with a window that can’t be closed showing all the porn video titles on the scan.  Everyone in the class was giggling and the teacher was shocked. It was a presentation for a Christian Studies class.",1392
aihge7,"For context, my daughter is 15 years old. She has been living in my house with her 2 month old son since he was born, and I recently reported her to child services. She has a case opened and the case manager is on the verge of recommending removal (several factors at play). When she first told me she was pregnant I told her she either got an abortion, gave the baby up for adoption, or she could have the baby but I would give her nothing but what I am legally required to. She had only recently started high school, and I will be the first to admit I took the news *exceptionally* hard. I was scared out of my mind for her. My wife had always kept things open and told me she’d taken her to our local health department to talk about birth control (our daughter opted out and her doctor was in support) so we got her a large bag of condoms in the event she were to choose to become sexually active. She was prepared, she had the knowledge, she refused the birth control and ended up pregnant. Honestly, we couldn’t even afford to support her *and* the baby if we wanted to.  My wife hasn’t worked since 2011 and her disability hardly makes a dent in our expenses. We finally had to downsize our home and sell my wife’s car just a few months before my daughter announced her pregnancy. I was working hours that just weren’t sustainable and my wife needed me to help her at home. About 5 months into the pregnancy (my daughter insisted on raising the baby) her boyfriend moved away to live with family in another state and didn’t tell her. She found out when the relatives made a post on social media about how excited they were he was there and then she was slowly blocked by the rest of the family. She hasn’t heard from him since, he has never met his son and the family has never reached out.  I told my daughter when she refused to abort that I would in no uncertain terms support her child, that I would love and treat them like a grandparent is expected to but I would not be financially responsible for it’s care or keeping and if she could not find a way to provide, I would call the appropriate authorities to intervene. She dropped out but only got a part time job, was unmotivated to get her GED or diploma through adult ed (I actually offered to pay for her class fee and test fees) and expected that my wife would take care of the baby while she was at work. She would often forget and miss a feed, refused to pump milk regularly and got a major breast infection, would often delay changing to save money on diapers, it was not a good situation. My wife and I of course were there behind her and have been using formula and making sure he was getting nutrients, but my daughter was not nurturing this child in any competent manner and while not malicious, was often neglectful of the baby. It wasn’t easy to make the call, but it was necessary and something I had long prepared to do. My daughter hates me, my wife is empathetic but has stood by my decision from the start, and I am both uncertain and at peace with my choices. Part of me feels like I did the best I could for everyone involved and part of me knows I betrayed my daughter on a horrible way and part of me knows that this baby deserves better than what she ( and really *we*) could provide.  Edit: I did not realize that this would blow up over night. I would like to clarify a few things, though. I did not ever allow that baby to suffer. I did say my wife and I were going behind her with formula to make sure he was gaining his weight back, I didn’t think I’d have to also clarify that we did indeed supply more diapers when we realized what she was doing. Also, we have not neglected our daughter nor have we treated her to such cold indignities like neglecting her medical care. We did get her infection treated promptly, she had prenatal and postnatal care. Contrary to what most people believe, I am not doing this out of anger. I am sad for my daughter and deeply disappointed that this is what life has come to but we cannot afford to raise her and a baby. I made this incredibly clear to her, and told her the consequences of her inability to provide once the baby got here would be child service involvement. We have not allowed either our daughter or her baby to wallow in filth or suffer, but we will not continue to provide the care for her infant, and so I had to call the only people I knew who would help. I won’t pretend that I have made all the best choices or that I am perfect, but I am not heartless or abusive. ",That was not a fun read and I imagine even less fun to live.  ,5531

aj912x,"Back, many moons ago I was a a college party with a few of my mates. Few drinks in, the house owner asks us if we want to smoke. Me being new to the scene I thought he was talking about cigarette or cigar. We get up to his room and he pulled out a bong and we all started smoking. So we finish a few rotations of the bong and I decided  this would be a good time to buy some weed for the first time. I smoked a little bit of what I bought and about 30 minutes later I hear a loud bang coming from downstairs. Apparently cops raided the house because you know, college party, small town, people get fairly annoyed when you have a loud music booming at 4 a.m. in the morning. So I panicked because I've never been this high in my entire life(im new to spicy cabbage ok can't blame me) and here I am with a half ounce of weed on me. I don't want to throw the weed away because I paid a decent amount of money for it so I did what any logical human being would do I spread my butt cheeks in a room of about 15 people and stuffed it between my butt cheeks.  I make my way past the cops as they are escorting us all outside and out the door. Then we get to the porch area and somebody says they're going to start chasing us like he's Whispering it to me and I'm high and drunk all at the same time and I have this guy behind me aggressively whispering ""run. they gone chase us....."" Thinking back to it now he was probably trying to get me to run so the copa would chase me instead of him. Maybe he had something worse on him than I did. I wait till I get about like a half a block away from the house and I just take off running.. The entire time I got my butt cheeks clinched hoping I don't drop his half ounce of weed out my crack. At some point I heard a dog barking and thought it was a police dog. I did the one thing you never so in scary movies.. looked back. I tripped, fell, rolled and popped up to kept running only to realize it was a neighbors dog. I make it about two miles or so to my friend's house. Did a reach around only to realize somewhere between the party house and my friend's place the weed fell out.  So now drunk, high and somewhat bloody me thinks, hey this is the perfect time to go back in the middle of the night with a flashlight looking for the weed I dropped that smells like ass crack and party juices. I never found that weed :-(. tldr: bought weed for the fist time at a college party that got busted by the cops. Stuffed the sack of weed between my butt cheeks to conceal it as we're being escorted out. Ran from cops thinking they were going to chase me only to lose my weed from my butt cheeks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Holy schnikes! my first gold courtesy of /u/BerryBBenson09 and its on a story about me packing my crack with nugs.   **Edit1**: I also have another confession. I posted this to r/tifu this morning and made an edit becasue someone said the story was unfinished. It wasn't very eventful after that but here is what happened.  I ended my night going back to my friends house after failing to find my weed and passing out on his livingroom floor.  Prior to passing out, I vaguely recall playing his flute for a girl that was at the party who also ended up at his house. I was trying to marinade(yes marinade so don't bone apple teeth me) her but failed horribly. I don't know how to play the flute. Never have a day in my life before then.  I also don't remember much more than that about the night. Just that my friends gf had a cute Yorkie(?) that I was obsessed with all night.

ajzsej,"LONG STORY. Bear with me. I worked 10 years in my previous job as an E-Commerce and Store Manager. I loved my job. I loved my staff. I loved the clients.  I did not love my boss. He was the most unprofessional and mean person I ever met. He was rude and ignorant to everybody and always thought he was right no matter what evidence anybody had to support the other. I have posted enough about him in previous threads. But I hated him. After years of his emotional bullying and gaslighting I was broken down. I went into a depression utterly lost and feeling worthless. I started applying for better jobs. So did my staff. They were open with me. We knew he was the problem. One day one of my staff called me out of the blue. Did I know anything about a redundancy? I hadn’t a clue what they were talking about. You see, we had a ‘shop’ iPod attached to our speaker system. However it was synced with my employers PERSONAL iPhone. Any calls, any WhatsApp’s and any texts went through his iPod aswell. A mild inconvenience to us if we were using Spotify but whatever.  A text notification popped up that was from my employers accountant. The message read “I’m not to sure in regards to statutory redundancy...” with the rest of the text cut off that my staff saw as they were changing the music on the iPod. My employer had folded a concession in a department store the year previous, perhaps he was following up with that? I really hadn’t a clue but this seemed plausible. It would be typical of him to leave important redundancy issues this late as he was an asshat. My staff were appeased, panic over. Nothing to do with us. Right? Except now I was curious. I knew I couldn’t look into previous texts on the iPod unless the messages had already been read by my employer. I waited until I was cashing up alone one evening a few days later and went to the iPod. There was a thread of messages from my employer to his accountant about putting the business into liquidation. I was shocked. I felt sick reading somebody else’s messages but I could not know. Was he talking about the previous location? There was no other details attached other than looking into redundancy and claiming liquidation. It didn’t specify any staff or store location or time periods. I didn’t share this information with my staff. But then I started looking into my employers behaviour. He was skittish, stopped showing up to work and was acting more odd than usual. I held out. I turned down a job and cut out a holiday I had planned to take. Sure enough, 3 weeks later I got an email about a staff meeting in regards to “financial readjustment” of the company. I knew the final bell had tolled. I still want my Oscar for my incredible performance of hearing this “News” for the first time. I got my redundancy. 4 months late. A healthy sum and a welcome one because I’m saving for a house. Of course he fought me on the amount and tried to short me almost €2000 but when I told his accountant I was going to bring him to the Claims Court  all of a sudden my calculations were correct! So yeah. That’s my little confession. And I’m not sorry. Fuck you *employers name*, you’re a prick  and what goes around comes around. EDIT; For all US Readers. Severance is the same idea as Redundancy. Redundancy is an instance where your job is no longer available or the business closes. You get paid either by your employer or through a subsidised Government Redundancy scheme. The later has a few qualifying factors.",Oh man this sounds so satisfying,1203
akkhai,"This was the early-mid 2000s when I was in high school. I was sort of the cool kid in high school, I played sports, I went to parties etc and all that kind of stuff. I also was a bully, not an extreme bully like you might see on television but I definitely teased kids a lot, especially for being feminine or gay. All of my friends did it, and I definitely took part in that.  &#x200B; But the thing is, I was bisexual. I wouldn't call myself gay, because I definitely enjoy sex with girls, but not as much as men. I used to drive to NYC with my friend (who NONE of my school friends ever met) and go to gay bars and have sex with men. I had a fake ID and everything to get into the bars. Nobody knew I did this except my small group of friends in NYC, and they weren't even really my 'friends' in that sense, they were just sort of people I went to go find guys to hook up with in the village.  &#x200B; Senior year, I got diagnosed with HIV. I knew I couldn't keep it a secret from my parents or anyone else. I decided to tell my parents that I had HIV, and I got it because I tried injecting heroin. Of course, no track marks, but the excuse was that ""I only did it 4 times and then quit"". Of course, I told my doctor that I got it from gay sex, but I told him to please keep this from my parents. &#x200B; My friends at school never suspected I was gay, they fully accepted the heroin excuse. It fit, very well, with my story up to that point. I had torn my ACL and got painkillers, and they knew I was taking them, so I just lied and said I got addicted to them (I didn't, but I did take them recreationally sometimes and they knew that) and eventually decided to try heroin. I was also doing loads of other drugs, coke, pills, xanax etc so it wasn't totally out of the norm. My friends were obviously saddened, they thought I was going to die, but luckily I am still alive to this day. The weirdest thing is, even after my diagnosis, I continued to bully gay kids at my school. I was such an unbelievably shitty person even after this death defying change in my life. I didn't really fully come to terms with the fact that I was homosexual until my early 20s. I have never came out of the closet fully to my family or friends.  &#x200B; &#x200B;",Wouldn't it had been an easier lie to say you got HIV from heterosexual sex?,1502
akyr8y,"I go to college in California, and it's pretty expensive here, like most of the U.S. My tuition is $20,000 a year, and that's without housing and food. So, when you go to school here, you expect to get your money's worth considering the cost. I came in as a transfer last year, and signed up to live in the transfer housing community, which was a set of nice apartments on campus dedicated to transfers. Well, what happened last year was the school accepted too many students, mainly freshmen, so they placed as many freshmen as they could in dorms, and then put the rest of them in the transfer community housing. That created an issue for some of the transfer students, such as myself, as the school had nowhere to put them. We got placed in ""temporary housing,"" which was condemned housing in an unsafe area across the freeway from the school. It was due to be torn down in March, so the school was trying to place people in housing asap. These apartments were only 625 square feet with four people in each one, and were super run down. The school didn't give us a discount or anything while I was living there, and charged us the same amount that they would have if we had been living in the nice apartments they promised us. It was ridiculous, and 1300 a month for this place, per person. So 5600 a month total, which is insane even for California. Basically, the school started putting the left-over transfers wherever they could. Some got placed in freshmen dorms, and I was not about to live in a dorm again, especially after being promised something better. The school still didn't have enough space, and they offered students a bribe to cancel their housing contracts and find somewhere else to live. I found a girl who was in the same situation and we found a place together and took the school's money, which was a pretty good amount, although not as much as they should have offered to be honest. So, her apartment was fully furnished, because the people who lived there before left all their furniture and everything. Most apartments were barely furnished at all and filled with furniture that the school rented. So my friend's apartment had all this nice furniture from Ikea, including a table, couch, five paintings, a really nice small cabinet, a coffee table, and a side table. Also, the people in the apartment across from her moved out and didn't lock the door, so there was that place too. We took almost everything from her apartment, including four chairs from the apartment across from hers. We were able to furnish our entire new apartment that we got together and used the paintings to decorate. We also took two desk chairs from my apartment and two mattresses. The school never said anything. My dad even helped us. He brought down the SUV and we went back and forth from the old apartments to our new one. So yeah basically my first bonding experience with my roommate was looting an apartment. We found some housemates and stuff too, and they got lucky because they didn't have to provide any furniture. We probably got over $1200 worth of furniture from those apartments. We didn't take the couch though, as there was no space, but we now live in a very nice apartment right across the street from where our old apartments used to be. They've been demolished now. Before they did that we saw moving trucks going over there and people loading all the furniture the school rented onto them, but no one ever contacted us about what we took. The desk chairs and mattresses belonged to the school, but we took them anyways. So yeah, that's why I sleep on a stolen mattress every night. Considering how much we get ripped off as students, it really was worth it, no regrets.","You stole some furniture, by the sounds of the situation the school had bigger problems.

He was so disorganized, absent minded and really didn't teach anything. The kind of professor that tells you to watch YouTube videos instead of actually teaching you the subject. It took him weeks to grade anything and I don't even think he read them. It seemed like he was just coasting until retirement.  Anyway, I flew out to see my grandma one week for her 90th birthday. I missed a few classes and missed a few YouTube lessons. Well the following week my grandma passed so I flew back out for her funeral in turn missing a few more classes. I was really far behind and really had no clue what we were working on, flunked the midterm and missed a big project. At this point I just gave up and reserved myself to failure and retake it in the summer. Didn't show up to any other classes.  At the end of the semester he emailed me regarding the final project and final test. He congratulated me on a great job with the group project. Really weird since I haven't been to class in months and was definitely not part of a group project. He was also wondering if I had turned in the final paper. I emailed him back and told him how happy I was that he enjoyed the project and I had definitely turned in my paper.

I left the hospital and crawled into bed and haven’t gotten up since. After 9 months of being pregnant and going through the journey of carrying a baby and to come home without a baby is heart wrenching, I knew it would feel weird but I never knew it would hurt this bad. To know that I had a couple who were a few months ago total strangers, who have stepped into my life to take care of my baby and love her as their own and give her something that I can’t is overwhelming. I don’t regret it, I want that to be clear. I know in my heart it was the right choice. I’m smart enough to know that she doesn’t deserve to be brought into an already complicated situation. She deserves 2 parents that can provide her with the stability and the love she deserves. And I can’t give her that. To give her up wasn’t sad, it was overwhelming. But now it’s hitting me how empty I really feel. I wish I could crawl into a hole and die. I feel like a failure, I feel like this is my lowest point. Her parents offered an open adoption and I said no. Simply because right now, I don’t think I can handle it. I don’t want to sound awful, but my biggest hope is that I can forget about this. I feel awful, and I don’t want to remember this feeling, I would like for my baby to grow up knowing she’s adopted and that this was an act of love, but out of shame and guilt, I don’t want her to know who I am.

This is the only place I could think of to dump my thoughts and clear my mind, It means a lot to me to know that someone out there, on some little speck of the internet, is listening to me.

apkib5,"So this happened a few years back.  I worked for a high end clothing store as a stock clerk/order pull.  One week they asked me if I would be willing to work the night shift from 8pm to 4am.  These were very unusual hours and it was me and two other coworkers required to stay.  I had another job lined up at the time so my commitment for the current one was not very strong to begin with. I decided I wanted to make my night a little more interesting so before I work I stopped and bought a bottle of whiskey knowing that my boss would not be working and it would be very relaxed.  I ended up drinking a lot more than I should have.  I'm great at handling my alcohol and my friends will tell me that I dont seem even slightly drunk, when on the inside I know exactly how drunk I am.  So I pounded a bottle of whiskey in my car right before going in.  About an hour and a half into my shift, I was stumbling and knocking stuff over, luckily none of my coworkers saw this.   I started getting hungry and I knew that on the 3rd floor there was a little bakery/restaurant that the store owns.  I'm not sure why they dont lock the bakery up but I thought it would be a good idea to go check it out.  I ended up hoping over the counter and getting into all of their cheesecakes.  I had about 4 slices of 4 different types of cheesecake, and I also helped myself to some sprite.  I was so happy but I started to feel really tired after, I ended up going into one of the dressing rooms and completely passed out on one of the benches inside.  I woke up about 2.5 hours later with my name blaring over the loud speaker.  I thought for sure someone had seen me and reported me.

I had been drinking Mikes Hard Lemonade and Tampon Blender Benders all night long. Full disclosure; I have an allergy involving certain alcohols that can cause severe hives, swollen throat, and intense diarrhea. I was 19, and stupid.  Anyways, I was chatting with my gal pal at the time and felt the inevitable groan of my stomach.  “Shit” I thought. Figuratively and literally.  I asked where the bathroom was, and she pointed down the hall.  I squeezed myself through the teenage crowd only to find a ridiculously long line of women waiting to use the toilet.  My bowels were screaming.  The cramps were intensifying.  I recalled seeing a toilet closet in the basement of the house once before and decided to take my chances. I darted down the stairs all while puckering my pooper with all the strength in me.  It was dark so I flipped the light switch and saw the porcelain throne glowing in the corner of the room. I slam the door behind me and shove my pants down around my ankles. I make a swift penguin waddle over to the toilet.  To my surprise, the toilet isn’t connected to the plumbing! It’s just sitting in the corner of the room. A failed attempt at a bathroom remodel, I had put myself in a perilous poo-position with no escape.   People saw me come down here, there’s no way I could poo in the toilet and get away with it.  By now anus was on fire. I could barely hold it in much longer.  I panicked.  I scanned the room and noticed an open mason jar filled with potpourri with the lid laying beside it on a shelf.  My mind was made up.  I snatched the mason jar from the shelf and promptly dumped the potpourri into the empty toilet bowl.  Ever so carefully I placed the mason jar on the floor of the bathroom and popped a squat over it. Spreading my cheeks and with surgical precision, I shat my brains out in that jar. I filled that sucker to the brim. I released the kraken of anal sighs and never felt such relief before in my life.  But what now? What do I do? I can’t leave it in here!  I hear my friends calling me from upstairs that they were wanting to leave. I needed an escape plan, now!  Quickly I pulled up my pants (wiping was not an option, but I’d pinched off like 99.99% of my shit, so it was *clean enough*) and placed the lid on the mason jar. It was warm. So warm. Still unsure of what to do next, I hide the jar under my hoodie and exit the bathroom as if nothing happened.  “What were you doing down there?” My friend asked.  “Just freshening up” I said, in absolute horror that she may notice my mason jar shit smuggling.  “Hurry up, we’re all in the kitchen waiting to leave” She barks.  I swim through the crowd of people to the kitchen to meet my friends. They’re all crowded around the pantry door which was next to the door to the garage.  “There you are!” They holler as they open the door to the garage.  Here’s my chance. The door to the garage was blocking the visual to the pantry.  I did it. I slide the smuggled shit jar out from under my sweater and place it next to identical jars in the pantry. And promptly left with my friends.  To this day, I wonder. I wonder with so much wonderment that I wonder how I’ve never been caught.  Did they ever locate this jar and open it? Was it assumed beef stew? Was it tasted? Smelled? Tossed?  I regret this. But I was desperate.  This is my poo-fession.   EDIT: Thanks for the silver, stranger! I’m shocked, amazed, and mildly disturbed that you’re all so fascinated with my story.  EDIT 2: You’ve all warmed my heart like the mason jar warmed my hands with your comments on my writing. I am not a writer, but I always enjoyed journaling and telling stories. Albeit, exaggerated ones. You guys are great. Keep that shit up.  EDIT 3: ID LIKE TO THANK THE BALL MASON JAR FACTORY, AWKWARD ALLERGIES, AND MY DYSFUNCTIONAL SPHINCTER  I COULDN’T HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT YOU.

aqwzq8,"When I was 12, I used to watch My Little Pony...as a boy. Obviously, being a boy watching a show viewed as for girls, I didn’t let anyone know I did, except my mom when she caught me watching it on her laptop. She encouraged it because she didn’t want to embarrass my possibly gay sexual orientation (I’m not gay, ladies ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)). Anyways, that sounded like a tangent but its why the computer broke. My aunt (who is only a year older than me and is considered my sister) and I often fought over the computer, seeing as it was neither of ours, therefore both of ours. If you shared something with a sibling, you know what I mean by that. One day when I was in my moms room, watching MLP as silently as possible, my aunt comes in and demands I give it to her so she could play on it. I said no because I was watching something. When I didn’t tell her after she asked what I was watching, she tried to snatch it from me, dropping the laptop on the floor and breaking the screen. We both froze, blamed each other for a little bit, then decided that my mom wouldn’t get mad at my 2 year old brother. When she got home, we said he dropped it off the bed, she scolded us for not watching him properly, and, like we anticipated, forgot about it. I’m sorry for blaming you, Yanick. Trust me, it was for the greater good.","Unrelated but it's cool to see others refer to their aunt/uncle as a sibling. I'm similar, five years apart from my nephew and seven with my niece. We are basically siblings and I could just picture us in this story.  Anyways rip laptop.  Edit: adding since everyone else is adding details, my half brother (which is where my niblings come from) is 40. I'm 19. Way easier to form a sibling bond with my brother's children than him, although he's pretty cool I suppose? ",1965
as56id,"I don't even know if this is the correct sub. Whatever, this has been weighing on my soul for the last year. Long story. Growing up, I knew my parents were never going to last. Four separations throughout my adolescence told me that. My parents were polar opposites. My father was attempting to build a business from scratch. He worked his body to the bone. His poured everything into it. I see now that this was his way of giving everything he had to my mother and myself. But he had a hardened exterior. His expectations for me and my mother were exhaustively high. This didn't bode well with the type of person my mother was. She was sensitive. My father's world was his business. Hers was me. The only child. I see now she gave everything she had to me. Every life lesson she held. Every bit of wit and intelligence she attempted to show me. She needed support and love. Things my father wasn't able to give. &#x200B; Fast forward to the day after my high school graduation. My mom bailed. I didn't blame her. I see why. But it was utter chaos at home. My dad's tough exterior was broke in ways I didn't think was possible. She never spoke to him again after that day. I know she wanted to move on and start new. &#x200B; College came and went with usual successes and mistakes that often posses the average 18-22 year old. My father was so in love with my mother yet. It was so genuine. It's so sad what it took for him to show it. My mother was mentally checked out though. Never brought up my father and I sure wasn't going to discuss it. With that being said, she made some poor life choices after the divorce. Career-wise and relationship-wise. Mistakes that carry consequences that can't be undone. &#x200B; My graduation day was looming. I couldn't put it on my mother to have my dad there. I thought it was so unfair to either one to have to miss it. I decided not to walk . My friends, girlfriend, everyone else did. I remember watching the ceremony and feeling so alone. &#x200B; The mistakes finally caught up with my mother after graduation. Her life was in full-blown tailspin mode. I should haven saw it coming. But I didn't. It happened. Suicide. The whole nine yards. 22. Mother dead. That shit sticks with you, let me tell you. &#x200B; My father was the best father he had every been in his life after that. We had such a good relationship. Something I didn't even think was possible growing up. We cried, hugged, shared fears. Everything I wanted growing up. It was as blissful as could be, given the circumstances. But fate had one more cruel card to deal. My dad a very routine surgery lined up a few months after my mother passed. You know what's next. He was the 1 in 2 million surgeries that resulted in death. Now here I was at 22, without either parent. &#x200B; After 5 years, I'm strong. My parent's gave me everything they could, in their own respective ways. I have my mother's compassion and love, but my father's strength and determination. I've never been depressed. People have it far worse than myself. The 22 years i received will be forever cherished with them. &#x200B; But of all the things feel horrible about...beyond all others is the moment that I stripped away from all of 3 of us. It would have been the first time in 4 years we all would have been together. It gained nothing. All because my 22 year old self was worried how my parent's would respond to seeing each other. I never apologized for this action. It was so selfish. Above all other actions, this weighs the most. It was so self-inflicted. Actions are permanent. This one is my largest mistake. &#x200B; &#x200B; Edit: Much thanks for the good vibes and thoughts from everyone. The empathy humans can express and show is beyond comforting. We are all flawed creatures. Growing from the rubble is what really counts.","you have nothing to feel sorry about, mate.... you did what you felt was best for them at the time.",474
asctjj,"Update- I honestly went back to the same laundromat this past Sunday. Did my laundry, didn't break anything went about my day lol. Thank you everyone for the karma and upvotes  Last night was doing laundry at the local laundromat.  I had 3 washers going at once. Now normally, you fill the wash, add detergent, add quarters and select the cycle. When I pressed the cycle button normally the previously selected cycle button pops out kinda like a switch. I didn't notice it but it happened with this washer. So the washer had 2 cycle buttons pressed. About half hour goes by and washer 1&2  are done but washer 3 is still on the first part of the cycle. Now it being 9pm and with the placing closing at 10 I decide to take the unfinished soaking wet clothes and put them in the dryer. About 2 minutes into the dryer the laundry attendant said I broke the dryer bc of the wet clothes. She took my wet clothes and put it in machine that just spins the clothes dry and then put them back in the dryer. She asked for my name and phone number so I wrote down ""Trevor Lahey"" and some random collection of 10 digits. Those of you who watch Trailer Park Boys will understand. So as the the last dryer is finishing the owner comes in ask me what happened. He couldn't believe that washer 3 didn't spin dry my clothes and was stuck in the same cycle for 1.5 hours until I had to physically show him how all the other washers work the same except for washer 3. He still even tried to spin it on me for breaking the dryer bc I didn't tell the attendant about the washer. So anyway he grabbed the piece of paper with my fake name and number and said that he'll give me a call tomorrow (today) to see how much the dryer is gonna cost to be fixed or replaced. Lol fuck off","ULPT: If you don't want to give out your phone number, give mostly your correct number but change the last digit or transpose two numbers or something. If you do this you have plausible deniability about giving a fake number and can claim the person misheard you or wrote it down wrong.",2399
aswcho,"A little over 8 years ago, I was doing a combined medical degree in a another country (the degree of which was recognised in my own country) and living on campus. The uni was quite large and within a month I had formed a group of friends with several others also studying medicine except one guy, we’ll call him Steve, who had barely made his science undergrad (a 3 year degree) and was in some of our classes, and decided he was part of our group. Like me, he was living on campus.  Anyway, in most social interactions he’d always compete with me and another guy (being the only other guys in the group), yet my provocative remarks for most of his actions made me his target (to be fair he really was an idiot). The only reason he stayed as part of the group is because he acted as an emotional tampon for the girls and often paid for their stuff and bought them expensive gifts for birthdays etc. Anyway, he began to become more frustrated with each passing semester, barely passing, and embittered due to his failure to find a girl which he *always* complained about (his reasoning was that he was always so nice and should be, I guess, somehow compensated for that). 3 years into my degree, I was doing well, however Steve had failed his 3rd year exams meaning he would have to repeat his last year, meaning one more year stuck with him. At this point, his toxic personality meant he was blacklisted from most social events and was rarely invited to hang out with us (the girls had finally had enough of him I guess) and he was stuck in this mental quagmire of inadequacy and frustration at not knowing how to rectify his social and academic failures. I had little do with him at this stage although he still hated me with a passion. One day I got very sick. Maybe I’d like to state now (it’s relevant later) that I was dating a girl who was pressuring me for a long term relationship, yet I was stringing her along with no thoughts further than dates or sex. I would leave the country soon and she’d try to convince me to stay, which I couldn’t. I was planning to end the relationship within a couple months. During my intense sickness, Steve decided he’d report to the uni that I overdosed on hard drugs, which resulted in the police being called and me being dragged over the city with a splitting headache and sore body to the police headquarters to do a drug test. The machine was malfunctioning so the officer made me stay the night there (which I didn’t know at the time was illegal), resulting in me getting more sick (vomiting, diarrhoea, etc) in a cell. It was shit. The next day the machine was fixed and the tests were negative, obviously, and I was free to go. I was on the other side of a large city though, with no money phone or anything. Had to call my girl from police phone to pick me up. I found out a week later Steve was the one who had reported me. I waited about 6 months, avoiding Steve and letting this blow over as well as observing him. He came back every Friday night from nearby club, drunk, at about 2 am to the dorms. The girl I was dating knocked on my rooms door about twice a week for you know what. I made sure to wait for a week where she’d come over on a Thursday, so she wouldn’t come over the next day, Friday. Anyway I locked my door but opened my window which I could climb into from the outside (I was on ground floor). Dressed in all black i waited on a bench on the road that Steve used to walk to the dorms. When he came past I proceeded to beat the crap out of him. I placed his unconscious body on the bench and ran back to the dorms, hid the clothes underneath my cupboard and went to sleep. Nobody saw Steve the next few days day, but soon he returned to uni. From hospital. I thought “I hadn’t beaten him *that* hard” (he was drunk and I’d stopped when he was unconscious). But apparently some other people had found him and had stolen his phone, wallet, shoes and pants but for some reason, decided to also stab him in the leg. At that point I was a bit scared because if I got caught, I would obviously have been thought to have done all of that. I disposed of the clothes a month later. This is the end my confession but its get more interesting.  2 months later, I hadn’t been caught and Steve was still angry trying to get to bottom of things. I was looking for a chance to break up with this girl because she was telling her family about me and was organising for me to meet them, but for some reason I waited a bit longer to end things. Either way, I wasn’t staying in this country. She knocked on my door one morning and said we needed to talk, I thought “here we go again” and I’d have to tell her I like taking things slow, I’m not ready to take our relationship to the next step etc. I thought that maybe this would be the right time to break up with her. However, she said none of that. She told me she knocked on my door one Friday night 2 months ago. I won’t go into details because you know what the conversation was like, but she had decided not to report my absence that night because she loved me. Long story short I went to her family dinner because I needed her to keep that secret and stayed with her for the next 2 years just because of that. After the degree I got on the first plane back to my country. No regrets.",What happened with Steve though? Did he ever got the degree? Is he still single and sad? I kinda feel bad he got stabbed and robbed lol.,1166
atmizg,"A couple years out of college I worked as an analyst at a pretty small private equity firm. The CEO was one of the biggest assholes I've ever met. He was fairly young in his 40s, a multi millionare, and the type of guy driven solely by money with 0 business ethics. He'd do anything to get the upper hand in a deal regardless of who it screws over...contractors, employees...I even saw him seriously fuck over a long time family friend of his without any remorse. Anyway, aside from my analyst role, as it was a really small business (only about 20 people in the office, and then a bunch of people working remote), I also happened to be one of the only semi technology-literate people in the company. So like many of my generation, I became the defacto ""Millenial Office Computer Guy"" too. Despite my lack of qualifications I got put in charge of handling pretty much anything minor tech related. Setting up servers....fixing laptop issues...answering ""How do I convert this to PDF"" questions...even basic network security. They thought I was some sort of computer genius...but really I was just mostly winging it, Googling pretty much everything. But eventually I got legitimately pretty good at all the tech stuff. They gave me bigger tasks like planning all of the computer systems for their owned businesses, and supervising installs. I didn't get paid extra for any of this mind you. After a couple years of serious bullshit working there, I was pretty worn out. I wasn't progressing. I hated working for captain douchebag...he treated everyone like shit. I was pulling 12-14+ hour days with no overtime or performance bonus. And they weren't paying me nearly what they should have. I also hated being ""the tech guy"" and was depressed as fuck basically living in a cubicle. So I decided I full on had enough of the 9-8 life working for assholes....and I would start my own consulting business working for myself. However, instead of quitting right away, I figured it would be smart to first build up my client base on the side while I was still getting a steady paycheck. So thats what I did. I launched my company, and landed my first clients. As the workload increased, I slowly started spending more and more time working on my side business while at my office job. At first I was pretty low key about it. But eventually, it was blatant. As it was a super small company....I was the only one who knew how to do a lot of important tasks and operate some key internal systems. It was easy for me to tell my boss a project was taking a whole week to complete, that I actually finished in 10 minutes. Pretty soon I was spending 80% of my day working on my own stuff in the office. I'd even take calls for my side business clients at my desk. The rest of the time I was usually dicking around on Reddit or something. Of course, we had systems in place to monitor network activity. But I was the person in charge of monitoring it. This continued for a while. As my own business ramped up, I cared less and less about the office job. And since I hated waking up early, I began rolling into work late. At first it was only 30 minutes or so. Then it progressed to an hour. When my boss didn't reprimand me...it became clear how much they needed me there. I took full advantage of this. Before long I was arriving around Noon, working for a couple hours, then heading home.  My coworkers werent happy, but I helped them with all of their tech problems and they hated the company too, so they kept their mouths shut about it. My boss eventually said something to me about all it at one point, but I just came in on time the next few days and then went back to coming in whenever I wanted. After more than 2 months of coming in 4-5 hours late, and working on my side business in full view of my asshole boss, I couldn't believe I wasn't fired yet. I deserved it and felt it was inevitable. On a hunch, I decided to do a little investigative work. As I was the ""tech guy"", I also had full access to the company email server. So I logged into the CEO's personal email account, and searched for my name. Lo and behold, there was a recent email thread between him, my direct boss, and some other team members with my name in the subject line. Obviously I open it. They're discussing my recent performance issues...the last email in the chain basically said ""If nobody has any objections, I will be terminating him at the end of the week"". 2 days from then. I wasn't surprised, but I decided there was no way I was going to let these assholes fire me. Although I didn't give a shit about that job, I didn't want to have a termination in my work history. I also wanted to keep getting paid for a while longer. Of course, I couldn't let him know I actually knew I was getting canned. So, I formulated a plan to perform a little inception reverse-psychology mind fuck on the CEO. The next day, one day before they planned to fire me, I requested a meeting with him to ""discuss my current performance."". In that meeting I sat down, and he asked me what I wanted to talk about. So I told him (paraphrased): ""Look, I know I've been a shitty employee lately. I'm sure you've noticed. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been kind of getting the feeling you guys are planning to let me go soon."" When I said that the shocked look on his face was priceless...he must have thought I was psychic to work that out on my own the day before it was going to happen. I remember him just saying something like “uhh"". I continued while he sat flabbergasted. ""So I'll be honest with you, My heart isn't in this job anymore. As you know, I'm an entrepreneur at heart...which I’m sure you can relate to. I want to start my own company. However, as you're aware, I have a lot of responsibilities here nobody else can do."" I then proceeded to list all of the things I did and projects I was working on. I could see it on his face when the realization sunk in of how screwed he'd be if I left suddenly. ""So here's what I propose. You don't fire me. I don't quit. I keep working here for a month, finish my current projects, and train whoever you want on everything I'm in charge of. After a month is up, I will continue to come in once per week until its complete. After that, if you still need me...you can pay me on an hourly project-by-project basis"".    I intentionally mentioned the possibility of me quitting so he could feel like he ""won"" the negotiation, even though I technically had him by the balls.  He paused to think for a minute, then said something along the lines of: ""Okay. You have a deal"".   So, not only did I get myself unfired...I actually turned the company into a paying client. During that month, I continued doing pretty much whatever I wanted since I had an expiration date (while training my replacement as promised). After the month was up they hit me up regularly for remote task work . I charged them triple what I was earning while working there, and barely had to deal with the CEO.  my client base was big enough I dropped them for good. ...after all that, the CEO still calls me up for advice/questions nearly 3 years later. These days I just blow him off saying ""Sorry, I'm too busy"". **Edit:** As it seems there’s some doubt that this actually happened (it did), figured I’d clarify a few points. 1) This was a very small company. The office had about 20 people in it, and several dozen more worked remote. If you’ve never worked in a small office before, I can assure you it’s pretty normal for employees to wear many hats and take on random roles outside their initial scope. It’s also pretty normal for them to be severely lacking with network security and controlling passwords.  2) I did not become some “computer genius” and never claimed to be (tho my company of technology illiterate baby boomers sometimes thought of me that way). I had decent basic working knowledge coming into the job, and picked up more over the several years I was there. For anything complicated (like wiring, hardware installs, advanced networking tasks etc) we hired outside IT consultants. But I was the guy who would source them, hire them, supervise them and learn the systems they put in place. And I just handled more basic tasks myself . We’re also not talking about enterprise level security here either 3) my consulting business has nothing to do with private equity. Im not going to reveal exactly what I do for privacy sake since this blew up, but it’s in marketing. I didn’t steal any of my old company’s clients when I left and don’t compete with them** 4) yes, Im fully aware and admit I was an asshole, hence posting this in /r/confession. In fact I decided to start my own company because I hate working for other people without my own skin in the game. I’m not a great employee when I don’t care about what I’m doing. However, the guys running the company were pretty shitty people, and I did not feel that bad about it at the time.           The thing I did have reservations about was snooping on the emails. I do not condoned invading privacy like that. However, he’d freely given me the passwords (so I could help him set up his outlook, forwarding, etc), and I felt me getting fired was inevitably coming soon.

avj3ko,"At work we have a kitchenette and at the end of the day, my coworkers leave their dishes/mugs filled with oatmeal and other things left to soak.  We even have a sign that states “Do not leave personal belongings in the kitchenette.  We are not responsible for lost items”. I stay at work pretty late so I see the night janitor come in and clean.  I noticed that he goes out of his way to wash the dishes and mugs, which isn’t a part of his job (our company only contracts them to do floors and trash so it’s our responsibility to clean up after ourselves). My coworkers must have noticed too because they have since stopped doing their own dishes and has been leaving piles in the sink knowing that they will be magically washed and dried in the morning.  They even make comments about the “Mexican sucker” that’s cleaning for them.  This has been on going for a few weeks now and my coworkers even have the audacity to complain about water spots on their mugs.  So throughout the day when I find myself alone in the kitchenette, I take an item or two and toss them out in the building hallway trash so it can’t be found. We work in a building where we share office space with other businesses and there’s no cameras so I haven’t been caught yet.  A coworker asked our manager about their items being taken, but my manager just reiterated the policy.  I guess I am being petty, but my coworkers are trash and I don’t feel bad.   Edit:  I should have clarified that I don’t do this everyday (the janitors days off) and I when I do, it’s  throughout the day time so no one can place blame on the night janitor.  I know some people are considerate and wash their dishes and mugs so by the time I’m throwing stuff out, it’s been at least a day or two of sitting there.  I’m keeping tabs.  My manger is cool and doesn’t care when people complain and refers them to the policy and shrugs it off basically saying “tough shit”.

ax7ta0,"My boyfriend and I owned two mice. However, they were both male so obviously they'd get into little fights and whenever things got bad we took the black one out because he had the mentality the whole cage was just his. This is the mouse I accidentally killed because he had begun to fight over food (even though we have two separate bowls of food for them) so I decided to go and bring out the black one to calm them both down. Well when I grabbed him he bit me pretty hard and everything happened so fast. My reflexes squeezed as he bit me and then he fell when my hand opened really fast after that. At first I didn't understand what happened but his legs weren't working and I realized he made a 'pop' feel in my hand. I started crying and woke my boyfriend up and after he took the mouse I laid down and cried. I couldn't stop crying. How could I do something like that? Yeah he was a pain in the a\*\* when he started the fights but he was the first mouse my boyfriend and I got. He ended up dying a 20 minute death because me squeezing him crushed his lungs and he suffocated. I just couldn't stop crying the whole night and couldn't believe that happened to me. Now our other mouse has no company and I feel so bad. We ended up giving his body to a snake owner to at least purpose his death. I watched him struggle in his last moments. I held him as he began going limp and I held his lifeless body. I dunno when I'll get over this or if I can. Everyone keeps telling me it's okay but I killed a creature I was supposed to help care for and I failed him. I'm so sorry. I also think my boyfriend kinda doesn't mind this happened because this mouse was such an a\*\* he never really seemed to like us and often only pissed us off but still he was our mouse and I killed him. &#x200B; EDIT: Nabisco's death didn't get bad until his last minutes. My boyfriend comforted him the entire time and encouraged me to say goodbye. I cried so hard I couldn't even speak I'm sorry to him I wish I were small enough to hug him in those moments. I knew he didn't deserve this no matter how mean he was at times. I still loved coming after classes and work to see our two mice. I didn't squeeze Nabisco until he popped. My hand squeezed hard and fast at the same time that resulted in his injury. lol DOUBLE EDIT: Thank you to everyone who has told similar stories and posted comforting comments.

ay54gt,"Back in high school I used to work the concession stand. In my school the booth was a little folding table where I would sell water, pop and chips.  To anyone that was a visiting team I would charge $.25-.50 more on the items they wanted to buy, and I would keep it.  I ended up making somewhere around $3,000 doing this for my high school career, and no one ever found out because I didn’t charge anyone from the home team the same amount.

aydy5p,"It was senior year of high school, and we were doing a partnered assignment in environmental science, tracking the river behind the school to find its source. There was an odd number of students and I was okay with working alone.  That day the principal was “observing” the teacher, evaluating her performance. My teacher trusted me, and gave me her laptop to do the assignment, and asked if I would show the principal what we were doing. I agreed and quickly finished my assignment.  The principal and teacher were standing by the door chatting, so I open the PowerSchool app. There it is... all my friends grades, including mine, staring at me in an excel style format.  I notice copious amounts of 0’s by my name, dragging my grade down somewhere in the low 70’s. (I was a minimal effort high schooler) I quickly changed most of the 0’s to 70’s or 60’s. This way it wouldn’t look too suspicious.  My heart was racing as I saved the updated grades, and I didn’t tell anyone for a few years including my best friend/ brother.

ayhk4u,"Jr year a ban in CA prohibited sale of soda in public school (specifically LAUSD).  I seeing a a need by many decided to spent my small savings from  allowance (17.00) on 3 costco 24 packs. School was selling at the time for .75 cents prior to the ban. So I matched the price. Roughly making 18.00 every 24 pack which was about 13.00 in profit per 24 pack. After my first week and 3 trips to costco I made enough to buy more inventory per trip minimizing my trips to costco and cutting into profits. Added variety to what I had(started with Coke, then added Sprite, then dr pepper).  At first I was holding in my locker but realize heat was an issue. Invested in an insulated bag and had 2-3 frozen waters inside to keep things cool, and added help was chilling the drinks the night before also, I was sold out on average before lunch or at the begining of lunch. 4 months I noticed sales drop and I was leaving school with inventory. Found out I had competition of others who not only picked up on what I was doing but started selling flavor variety like cherry coke, fanta, Shasta and what not. By this time I had already established myself with faculty and  added diet cokes/diet dr peppers per request, yup, paid then off with free drinks which took a hit on profits weekly but secured me from getting in trouble with most security guards where I made transactions and classes I had and a few trusted teachers from previous semester. On average lost about a 6 pack to 9 sodas weekly, no big. Had the principal and a few vice principles buying as well. Needless to say competition wasnt something I needed. Had em get pinched by faculty once I found out who it was. Out of 6 (including myself) 4 got caught, the other gent I let him continue doing what he was doing because I knew his background and he and his fam needed the money.  I did get pinched by a substitute in class, was sent to the same vice principle who was a buyer. All I was told was be careful and sat in his office till next class period started. My end goal was to pay for all senior fees which include cap, gown, diploma, senior night, prom and senior ring.  By early senior yr I had made enough to cover all fees, including my tux rental and my portion of a limo for prom night. Also bought a PS2 and saved the rest as a base starting point for. Used car ( after starting a job and saving for an additional year it ended being a 97 honda accord, so nothin fancy) End of senior yr I helped 2 Jrs continue what I was doing and helped them figure it out and connected them to my faculty buyers. I have 0 regerts about it all.  Update: Holy crap this blew up while I was in Class!  What's gold?! What's silver?!  Thank you to who ever gave them to me...can I buy soda with it!? I should also clarify this happened back late 02 to early 04. Just figured stature of limitations expired and figure some people would enjoy it. Appreciate the love  Answering some questions:  -Yes I'd do it all over again, roughly 1300 in student dues was a burden my parents didnt need on them, not including the 300.00 for tux and limo fees.  I'm glad I didnt have to go sell candy to raise the money in a saturated market in which everyone was doing the same damn sales in the same district. -Yes, I was a snitch, but I felt I was in a position where I had 0 repercussions to face since I was well liked.

This was before credit cards so everyone paid in cash. All I would do is keep a quarter or dime of almost everyone’s change I gave back. I would put that extra quarter or dime in a special spot in the register. Once I got 5 or 10 worth of change I would dump the change into the right spot and pocket a 10 or 5.  Some nights I would leave with over 50 bucks in cash (a lot to a 16 year old me). No one ever caught on and only twice I can remember people telling me I gave them the wrong amount of change back.

b094pd,"&#x200B; This is petty. I don't care. I've worked at a company for two years. In that time, I've gone from an 'incredible asset to the company' to 'babysitter'. I wish I was joking. This company is owned by several people, but managed by a relative to the higher ups. A guy who has never worked for anyone except his Mommy (who owns the company). A guy who is incapable of doing basically anything for himself. Someone who will 'one day' take over the company, who currently can't even figure out Bluetooth. Moron would be a compliment. You think I'm just being harsh on my boss, or exaggerating. I wish. I wish it was just me being dramatic. Last phonecall I had from him was him asking where he was. No, I'm serious. ""Foot, I'm driving. Where am I?"" He asks me to track his phone, find his location, see if I can find a store near him that sells a certain item (that he can't remember the name of the store either, or where it is exactly), and then I am to GPS voice navigate him there using track his phone to tell him when to turn. This is my life. 50+ phone calls a day from this man. ""Foot, did you get my email?"" ""Yes, I responded to it and answered your questions."" ""Oh good. Read it out to me."" Proceed to read the email to him. He is happy. Fast forward two hours. Get a scathing email from him, responding to my reply: ""Foot, why did you email me again when we just talked about this on the phone?! This wastes my time."" I no longer do my regular job. I've been transitioned into this 'Personal Assistant' role, even though I did not want it. At all. To the point I'm currently searching for a new job. The company is bleeding money like someone cut off both of its legs. Boss is supposed to be figuring out why, but the guy can't even pour himself a cup of coffee from the machine we've had for six *years.* In my day to day, I also assist other departments. I have access to various software. I work alongside multiple managers and assist with their projects as well (when I'm not being asked to identify the brand of socks Boss is wearing so that he can figure out where to buy more, and have me call to 'have them set aside a package for me so I don't have to walk through the store looking for these like an idiot') Based on my observations, I found several problems that are costing us money. Either by purchasing, distribution or just general lack of adaquate price adjustments. Some were serious enough that I even spoke to a different department manager, who was impressed and took me to the CEO to ask if I can be moved to their department to help fix some of the identified problems. CEO is Boss's Mother. I get told that I absolutely am not allowed to transfer. That I am far too valuable as a personal assistant to be shared with other departments. That Boss will handle and oversee the changes that need to be made. Manager and I were stunned. Turns out, Mother wants to step away from the company and wants Boss to run it. That Boss just needs more projects to work on to get a better understanding of how to run the company. Boss gets called in, told that I identified several issues and that Boss needs to get them resolved. Boss gets mad at Mother, telling her he doesn't have time to do that. Mother says she understands, that he is a very busy boy. (Again, I'm not joking. Sitcoms can't even write this kind of shit). Boss later calls me into his office, and tells me that I am to work on fixing all of these issues, but that I'm to give him all my notes, tell him how I fixed it and he will present it to the board. Boss then proceeds to leave for the day, calling me later to ask what kind of mustard was the mustard he liked the most on his deli sandwiches. Then proceeded to lecture me on mustard, because the answer I gave him was obviously not the right kind of mustard and that I need to pay more attention to things like that. I hung up the phone, picked up all my notes on this 'bleeding money' situation / project and shredded them. Oops. Sorry! I'm too much of an idiot to handle doing any type of investigation work into our financial records for the past 5 years. I'm certainly too much of an idiot to notice that your profit margins went from 32% to less than 18.3% on the majority of our products we manufacture, all the while giving our distributors more than 46% discount so that they 'keep coming back for more'. Here is hoping Boss can figure that out, especially considering the layoffs we keep having. Excuse me while I make note of what kind of mustard he prefers on his montreal smoked meat sandwich, which is a much more important use of my time. Because, in the words of Boss: ""Maybe one day you'll be capable, like me, if you keep working at it.""

The water kept going and pretty soon the people beside me were going, “What the hell is that??!” and were frantically panicking. At this point I knew that it would start flooding the room, so I had to make a dash for it. I ran out the stall. My cheeks burned as I dashed outside the lobby area, but not before seeing the “Out of Order” sign taped to the washroom stall door. To this day, no one knew it was me.

When I was off work and trying to sleep or relax I was constantly getting work related calls and texts from the other shifts including my boss. I was carrying the whole department basically.  I loved what I did but I didn’t feel I was getting paid nearly enough so after a year or so I started getting sick of never really being off work.  My boss had a company paid cell phone and as a manager he was required to keep it on at all times in case there was en emergency at work. During this time I had an old prepaid phone that was still active with carryover minutes. One night when we were slow at work I used *67, which blocks your number from being displayed, to call his phone and wake him up at 3:00 am. When he sleepily said hello I hung up. I planned on it being a one time thing but when he came in the next morning he was red eyed and exhausted like I was all the time from being called when off work.  From that point on I would call him in the middle of the night two or three times per week. Most of the time I would let it ring three or four times and hang up. Sometimes I would call him from my real phone and pretend I “butt dialed” him. On the days I would call him when he was sleeping he would drag in looking rough and I would take secret pleasure in seeing him feel like I did since I was still constantly being called when I was off.  Occasionally he would comment that some “damn asshole” called his phone and woke him up. After about a year they hired another supervisor so my work was cut in half. I finally got some time to relax and get some rest. I stopped calling him at that point after almost a year.  Sometimes I’m torn between feeling bad about doing it and also that maybe I should have done it more.

He started SCREAMING in his sleep. AHHHHHHHHHH!!!! over and over and it went on for like 30-45 seconds, which when someone is screaming in their sleep, is an eternity.  Once he started screaming we all woke up except him, one of our fellow medics looked over and said ""Jesus, someone wake him up!"".

b3ylfj,"So, for a little background, my moms ex husband was a jerk. Later on in life, I found out that he was even worse than I thought, but even to 5 year old me, he was a jerk. For example, there was one summer that he spent all of our money (meaning his and the money from the THREE jobs my mom worked at the time) on cigarettes and booze and other dumb shit, leading to me and my sister having to spend the summer at my grandmother's because there was literally no food in the house and my mom had to live off of bread and butter for about 3 months. He was that kind of guy.  So, when I was a kid, I always got up much much earlier than everyone else. I can't remember why, but it was probably just so I could watch cartoons in peace. One morning, I went into the living room to find this dudes pocket knife on the couch. It was closed, but i got curious.  I opened it and I was playing with it, when I had a thought. Obviously I can't remember the actual train of thought, but it led to me deciding to cut my hand, right in the center of my palm, so that mom would be mad at Meat-Head-Mcdonald. I immediately started bleeding, and a lot. (Now, I know that I bled so much bc I have a blood clotting disorder, yay me) I started screaming, mom came down the stairs along with Dick-Wipe, and they saw what happened.  I told mom that he had left the knife open on the couch arm, and I had put my hand down on it on accident. This led to one of their biggest fights, with mom saying that he was endangering me, and Micro-Penis saying he swore he didn't leave it open.  So yeah.

And we both often wouldn’t buy lunch so we would have a little extra cash.  So one spring afternoon we were walking home and decided to grab a snack, cheddar fries were my choice. We opened our snacks and started to feed the seagulls as we walked by a pond. My sister said something along the lines that seagulls are dumb and I insisted to tell her they are relatively smart. To prove my point I told her if they were dumb they would swoop in to grab a fri if I threw it into a busy road. But seagulls being smart would just let it be until there was no traffic.   So I throw the fri into the street and of corse a seagull comes diving in after it to retrieve the snack. BAM. Charles, the dead seagull we later named was hit by a car. The woman looked absolutely mortified and then the seagull cocked its head up for a moment then died. This has been a secret that has been kept between the three of us (me, my sister, and the driver) and we have never shared.  Moral of the story, seagulls are dumb and just want food.

So I got to the point where I was so sick to my stomach I was about to shit myself, I told her I had to run to my car and smoke a cigarette, so I went outside pondering what I should do, and it dawned on me that I had paper towels in the glove box, so I grabbed them and went to the side of her house and did my business by the side of her house, and it was dark out so I wasn’t worried about anyone seeing me. Well I came back in feeling like a million bucks, we banged some more and I stayed the night again. Well the next morning about 7am we hear loud banging on the door, and she went to the door to check it out, and I heard some angry talking for about 5 mins, and she came back all confused looking and I asked “what’s wrong” and she said “my fucking land lord is all pissed because he stepped in dog shit, and is blaming me for having a dog”, and OBVIOUSLY I don’t have one!

bd542l,"I was only 20 years old and I nannied for this little baby boy. The mom seemed off. She would sleep the entire time I was there in the mornings , or go on three hour runs, or sometimes would just go about her business around the house- completely ignoring me. One time we both sat in the living room while the baby was sleeping in his room- I was reading a book (studying) and she sat there eating McDonald’s and watching her show. She did not say a word to me the entire time.  Well, one day when she was out I snooped around and found her journal- I read the whole thing. Then got sad for her- she was so unhappy in her marriage and in life. I ended up working for her for three years and we became close. But that first year was so uncomfortable and awkward. In retrospect, it seems very obvious that she was suffering from post pregnancy depression. Edit: thanks everyone for the positive comments; I honestly was not expecting that- I just wanted to confess. For those of you who think I’m a horrible person for doing this, that’s ok. It was over 15 years ago and it still weighs on my mind that I invaded someone’s privacy. I felt bad about it then which is why I tried to repay by helping, but yes I did invade someone’s privacy and that’s not cool, I’m certainly not saying what I did was ok. Hence, the confession... Also, as a 20 year old with no concept of the hardships of having kids I didn’t understand why she was acting the way she was; I get it now.",That is sad. &#x200B; My ex wife had   post pregnancy depression. We almost divorced at that stage.. but that is not a time I would want over in my life again.,3591
bdgozp,"   I live in a basement of someone's house cause they're family owns apartments and so this guy made his basement into a nice studio loft. My landlord is same age and gender as me (late 20's male). I like to use porn to masturbate but there is something about hearing/seeing people have sex in real life that really gets me off. My landlords girlfriend is a definite moaner and I've always loved women who moan during sex. I realized I could hear them if I didn't make any noise and I thought it was pretty hot; it would get me in the mood and I would use porn to finish myself off.  Anyways, to why I made this post. I discovered that the closer I was to the vents, the better I could hear them. I have a vent in the closet that is the biggest one down here, maybe it's the main outflow for when the heater/AC goes on? Whatever, point is, I can stand on a stool and put by ear up to the vent (it's about 7ish ft high) and listen to every moan, breath, and ball slap that goes on and I think it's so fucking hot. My landlord and his girlfriend are pretty attractive people it's not like I have to pretend they are someone else while listening either. I feel like a trained dog because whenever I think I hear a moan, I rush over to the closet, get on the stool, dick-in-hand and put my ear up to the vent, hoping to get some audio porn. Half the time it's a false alarm, but when it isn't, it's so hot and I proceed to have a great orgasm.  So another lesser confession would be that one time I heard what sounded like moans and so habit kicked in. Stand on stool, dick out, ear to vent, proceed to masturbate. Half-way through I realize it's the girlfriend crying and making moaning sounds, not sex-moaning sounds. I almost shot my load off to a woman crying by herself at midnight. Fuck that was weird. Fuck I'm a weirdo for even getting half-way there.",Sometimes you just gotta vent,3027

bfklm0,"Title says it all. I was 16 and my first job was in a shoe shop. We had one regular awkward woman customer who came in every Saturday afternoon whilst the store was at its busiest and literally asked to try on every pair of shoes in the shop before leaving an hour later without buying anything. I was the new boy and the youngest, so all the other staff always dumped her on me. One day, she was up to her usual Saturday afternoon hobby and an elderly lady, obviously visually impaired handed me a pair of shoes and asked me how much...  They were the awkward customers own shoes that the elderly woman had picked from the floor. I quoted her a ridiculously low price and she bought them immediately. Ten minutes later, the awkward customer started shrieking that she couldn’t find her shoes and after complaining to the manager believing they had been stolen by shoplifters. He was having none of it stating it wasn’t the companies fault if customers had their personal property stolen in the store. The woman had to buy a new pair of shoes or leave bare footed. We never saw her again.  Edit: Thankyou for all the replies. I would never have believed this posting would generate so much interest as I posted this story over a year ago as a reply on AskReddit and only received 3 replies, lol. To elaborate on the story and answer some of the questions raised; firstly, yes, it is a true story and happened some time over the school summer holiday period of 1984 shortly after I started working at the store. The department I worked in wasn’t exactly the normal shoe shop environment most people are familiar with. I worked in a special department on the lower ground floor of one of the larger branches of a national shoe retailer and this department sold all the reject stock from all the other branches. Stuff such as shop soiled, sun faded stock from window displays, repaired damaged stock, customer returns etc. The stuff that was below the standard that could be sold in the regular departments. All stock we held was displayed on the shop floor on racks so you couldn’t ask for different sizes etc as it was all random stuff. We only displayed the right foot of a pair of shoes and customers had to ask for the left foot of the shoe to try on, and there was a rule that only one pair could be given to one customer to try on for security reasons. We had a major problem with shoplifting and there were only normally two or maximum three members if staff manning the department. It was a hell of a job keeping track of the pairs that were handed to customers to try when the shop floor was busy, and often shoplifters waited till we were all distracted then left without paying. This was before cctv so all we had were our eyes to monitor where paired stock was on the shop floor... The woman I describe as awkward, wasn’t just awkward in the traditional sense, she was totally obnoxious, narcissistic, racist and constantly demanding attention. Her behaviour lost us a lot of stock to shoplifters because she distracted us from watching other paired stock out on the shop floor and she wouldn’t return pairs she didn’t want, just kicked them off in a corner before wandering around looking for the next pair. A couple of weeks before the story, a pair of shoes she had asked to try were stolen because of her doing this and her attitude when we asked her, was that it wasn’t her problem and we deserved to lose stock because we were all Jews (sorry if this is offensive to you but that’s what she said)... Back to the original story, lol, the incident wasn’t premeditated, it was one of those spontaneous  ‘fuck you’ opportunities where all rationality temporarily disappears for a moment. The elderly lady handed me the bitch woman’s shoes and that was it, lol. I only asked the elderly lady for either 50p or £1, I can’t remember what, bagged them and the sale went through the till followed by a Thankyou... incidentally, the condition of the bitch woman’s shoes and quality of brand was a lot better than the crap we sold, so the Old  Dear got one hell of a bargain... My thoughts immediately afterwards weren’t of satisfaction, they were of ‘Oh Shit’, and I was bricking it, worrying what would happen next, lol. When the shit hit the fan and the manager became involved, I was just glad he was pre-aware of her and had no sympathy of her loss because of her attitude when she previously lost our stock. Once again, Thankyou for all replies and unexpected flow of upvotes.","Thats hilarious, nice job. made 2 sales, and got rid of a bad customer. good work.",2637
bg4m5d,"Some of my family and close friends know that I have struggled financially. No one has any clue just how bad it was, how reckless and foolish I was, or how lucky I am to be where I am today. And nobody knows about the taxes at all.  Here's my confession... I started a small business in 1998, a single member LLC, which meant the company's tax return was schedule C of my personal tax return. I never made quarterly tax payments but always had the money for taxes until April 15, 2003. I was about 30K short so I filed the return and paid what I could, planning to pay the balance over the next few months. But business was weak, and I drew too much for myself, and a year later I had not made any payments. Plus I owed taxes again that I couldn't pay. I just submitted the return and no money at all.  I did the same in 2005. In 2005 IRS filed for a judgement against me and was awarded a tax lien for what I owed from FY 2002-2003, $116,000. IRS took no action to seize my assets then or in subsequent years. Late in 2005 I got a golden opportunity. I took on a bunch of staff, and equipment that I signed notes on personally. Money was flowing again. At tax time 2006 I had most of what I owed but I had invested heavily in the new line of business and decided to double-down, seeing millions in profits on the horizon to wipe out my debt. So I filed but didn't pay.  By 2007 things were humming. I had leased bigger space, and increased staff again. At tax time however I was stunned by what I owed, more than $250K.  I filed and sent no money, rationalizing again that I'd be sitting on millions by 2008. IRS had been sending me automatic semiannual tax statements since the judgement two years earlier but otherwise hadn't reached out to me at all, and though the amount owed was staggering I didn't feel huge pressure to pay. Then the recession hit, and more than 60% of my business disappeared overnight on September 29, 2008. From 2008 to 2012 I tried to downsize and stay afloat but the company died a slow death. I filed tax returns but paid nothing. When I finally closed the doors I was sitting on $1.2M of tax debt, and hundreds of thousands in company debt I had personally guaranteed. I was also broke. At the end of 2012, I sold my only significant asset, a home, for a net gain of $150,000. The IRS lien for $116,000 came off at the settlement table, but since there were no other judgments filed against me I walked away with $34,000. In 2013 I started working for another company, earning a paycheck with normal tax deductions. I worried IRS might come after my wages but they never did. In 2014 I filed a return and was actually due a small refund, but got a letter saying it had been applied to my tax debt. It was the same in 2015 and 2016. While the IRS wasn't coming after me, other creditors were, resulting in some judgments against me. But with no assets and living paycheck to paycheck, there was nothing to take and so no real repercussions. In 2017 I filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. You can have tax debt more than 3 years old discharged, provided that returns were filed. By the end of the year ALL of my debt had been discharged, and the liens and judgments nullified. The total amount was nearly $2 million, including 1.2 to IRS. Today I am living better than I have for a decade. I am renting a nice place and my only debt is a car loan for a new vehicle I just got. I actually have the best credit since 2009. You'd be surprised by how easy it is to get credit post-bankruptcy. I have money in the bank for emergencies for the first time in a few years, and I was recently promotes to GM where I work.  A few more details you may be wondering about...   -- I always paid state taxes. Otherwise I would have lost licenses essential to operate the business. -- I had accountants prepare the returns. I never e-filed. They would send them to me in hard copy with instructions and payment info. I signed and mailed the returns myself. I kept them mostly clueless about not paying. -- This forum's rules prohibit posts about relationships. All of this had a big impact on those around me, obviously. It's been hard. Can't say more. -- I do feel remorse, but not really about the taxes.  I am embarrassed by my poor decisions and foolhardy optimism, and I am ashamed of all the small businesses who I owed money to but paid nothing. I am also extremely regrettful about how my actions impacted those closest me. I am very lucky to have made it to better times. -- Always file tax returns even if you don't include money due. If I hadn't I would probably be in jail.  Owing taxes is a civil matter. Not filing returns is a criminal offense.","It isn't a crime not to pay, but it is a crime not to file, you're right about that.  Scary situation.  I hope if you're ever able to own another business that you pay closer attention to this.  Good luck.",2159
bgi6ly,"I went to an Ivey league university in Ontario Canada right after high school. My marks weren't great but they were good enough to squeeze me in. I spent most of my time in University partying rather than studying but still managed to pass all of my first year classes. In my second year I skipped a lot of classes and was very lazy with the course work. My marks were terrible and I failed a couple of my courses. In my third year about half way through I dropped out and got a job landscaping.  &#x200B; I did that for a year when I realized it really sucked and I began to regret not trying harder while I was in school. I figured I would apply to jobs that would normally require the degree that I would have gotten. I had spent the few years in school I was easy enough to make the timeline on my resume make sense and although I dropped out I had a decent knowledge of the area.  &#x200B; The field I was attempting to enter is difficult start out in and it took a few months of sending applications to get an interview. The company I got an interview with (my now current employer) is an internationally recognized name in the energy sector. I was extremely surprised to get my interview. One of the documentation requirements was university transcripts and with an hour or two in photoshop I had my proof of graduation. I sent in the papers with the other required information and never heard anything back describing any problems with my records. I ended up going through three interviews in the process and received a position. &#x200B; I have have now been working with this company for almost 5 years. They provided all the necessary job training and nobody has ever questioned my education. I entered with a starting salary of $72,500 CDN and received annual raises. Upon hiring me I was told that the management staff was quite impressed with me through the hiring process and that they usually only hire applicants with minimum requirement of a Masters Degree. &#x200B; I basically shit my pants everyday while in the interview/training process but now I don't really think about it ever. I didn't tell me university friends I faked having my degree. The only people that know I did this are my parents.  &#x200B; Thanks for reading !",You should probably stay at that job your entire career.

bgu4xs,"This happened when I was around 7 or 8 years old. It was my first year in Primary school and I had joined the school with some of my friends from the local feeder school in the area.  One particular boy was a year older than us and was repeating the first year for some reason. He was of German descent, from a very well to do family and a lot bigger than the rest of us. Possibly because he was embarrassed at repeating the year he was a bit of a bully. He often picked on me and some of my friends. I’m sure we probably escalated things at times too because I know he was teased for being German.  So one day, standing outside class I kicked him full whack in the balls. He buckled over but I can’t really remember much of what happened afterwards, we probably tucked tail and ran. I can’t even say for sure whether he deserved to be kicked at the time or if I just thought I was getting him back for previous behaviour.  Anyway, he missed school for a few days after and I heard some kids saying he was in hospital. Soon after that I was called in to speak to a teacher who as far as I remember dressed me down and explained he had gone home and his testicle has swollen up to the size of a tennis ball and it had to be removed. I don’t really remember getting into much trouble about it but I do remember some of the other kids going on about it in banter.  The details are hazy but I felt so bad and I felt I was in so much trouble that I never ever told my parents about it. This was made worse as my dad and his dad had gone to school together, only found this out after seeing my dad chatting to his dad at a rugby match that me and the kid were playing one Saturday about a year after. I was freaking out the whole time they were speaking and then started feeling guilty that my Dad might have been seen as rude by his Dad for not apologising for my action. It didn’t come across that way, as they seemed like old friends catching up but I felt so guilty.  I felt so awful about it, I mean at the time I didn’t realise that it may have an affect on him being able to have children but I felt like I’d done something so horrible and always expected my family to confront me about it. When I learnt of the reproductive challenge this might cause the guilt was just amplified.  The years that followed in primary school were mostly fine, on the odd occasion he would have a go at me, I remember him having a slightly shorter fuse with me than others but I think he ended up being ok and less of a bully. Saying that, he did try drown me in a river at our primary school leavers camp as I’d pissed him off for some reason but mostly the in-between years went by without incident.  I left that school to go to a different high school so I never maintained contact with him. I saw him once during my teenage years and we chatted for about 5 minutes. I remember it being friendly. I never, ever mentioned it.  I hope he was able to have children. I’m sorry bro. I’m sorry I never said sorry too.","So he’s German, a bully, and only has one testicle. 🤔",2555
bh2w5e,"I while back while I was still in college I lived with my then fiancée in a very over-priced apartment in a relatively big city. At the time, my job was only paying about $7.50/hr and I was studying and working full-time just to pay the bills. Basically a decent yet expensive apartment, and *just* enough money to pay the bills.. not much wiggle room.    Well one night my S/O was at work and I was at home, heating up some leftovers for dinner in our microwave and as I go to take the plate out, it slips and hits the door of the microwave on the inner edge and completely **shatters** the front of the microwave. So I'm freaking, expecting my S/O to come home mad at me and/or just stressing about having to buy another one. And then I saw a walmart receipt on the counter and I went to walmart.    It was probably around 9pm, my S/O was going to be getting off soon, so I'm rushing. I walk in, find the *exact same* model of microwave that we have, and grab it off the shelf. I took the receipt out of my pocket and held it with the microwave, and just walked out the door. After getting it out and setting it up I told my S/O I cleaned the microwave. Never told a soul about it. That was probably about 6 years ago... still using the microwave :/ EDIT: Holy shit I didn't think this would get so much attention. I'm going to reply to some comments later today but I'm about to work a 10 hour shift so it'll be a while. Also yes my relationship dynamic at the time was toxic. I found that out about 6 months later. In a much better place now. Thanks :)","I was coming here to say, how in the hell did you sneak out of Walmart with a microwave? Like that doesn’t fit down your pants mate. Receipt was a solid play.",3481
bhhaua,"Only 1 person (besides my multitude dealers and some of the randos who go by their houses) even know that I was using. Everyone in my normal life thinks I have been 100 percent clean and sober.  My main drugs of choice before I got clean were alcohol and heroin, although I would do anything you put in front of me.  I got prescribed pills after a dental procedure, and, more than that, they actually gave me one while I was still in the office. I took it without really registering what it was in my weird/foggy headspace. Later, I realized. I figured I had already broken my sobriety so fuck it. Might as well get the prescription filled so I didn’t have to be in pain. In less than a week I was scoring dope again. In less than a month I was up to a gram a day, then eventually 3. It was consuming my life, my money. It was getting hard to keep covered up, and I think some friends worried about me, but I also had several unrelated semi-tragedies occur during this span of using (about 6 months) and I blamed the weight loss and acne and general lack of well being on stress.  Strangely, I never used anything else during this relapse. I didn’t even have a beer.... and I love me some IPAs.  The fact that no one knew made it hard to stop. I had to keep using to stay well to keep up appearances. If I got dope sick the truth would come tumbling out. I would lose my job. My family. My friends. My house (my roommate is sober, and would definitely not allow me to live with her if she found out I was using again). I didn’t want to have to start over. So... I kept using and everything got worse and worse.  Until today.  Today... I’m clean.  Today... I have 24 hours.  Today... I fucking did it.   And no one knows.  And I can’t celebrate it.  But I want to cry I’m so happy.  And I had to tell someone.  Thank you for reading, and being one of the ones who knows that I’m gonna be free again. Also, I don’t know what I’ll do about my sponsor, telling the truth about what happened that is, or anyone else in my life. Maybe one day, but for now, I’m just gonna try to stay clean. Edit: First off, thank you all so much for the overwhelming support. It is helping me more than you know in a time when I feel so alone and so physically and mentally horrible.  Also, I couple people asked so I figured I’d just put it here. I lied (again) to my friends and family and said I was gonna go camping now that the weather is nice. I packed up all my camping gear and then parked my car at the airport parking garage (where I figured it was least likely to be seen by someone I know) and took the bus to a shitty hotel.  I am taking baclofen, clonodine, and gabapentin. I also have phenobarbital for sleep and for day three (the worst day in my opinon) or whenever it gets too bad to stand.  As a last ditch failsafe, I do have suboxen as well in case I get to the point where I’m about to go pick up.  Buuuut I really don’t want to take the subs if I can at all avoid it.  That’s just taking off the gorilla off my back and replacing it with an angry chimp. But it would be better than using so... again, it’s the final line of defense. EDIT 2: Holy crap, I never expected this to get so much attention or such a huge outpouring of support. I want to (and eventually hopefully will) reply to all of your comments and messages, but right no my brain isn’t working so great. In the meantime I just want to say a couple things to all of you.  First, all of your support has been so moving and so helpful. Yeah, I may be a little extra emotionally fragile right now because of the boat I’m in, but I have regardless spent a fair amount of time crying tears of joy. I never imagined that so many people would even acknowledge this, let alone be so genuinely and emphatically caring and invested in my struggle. It means more than any of you can imagine, truly...it does. I felt so alone and lost and scared, and you have given me exactly what I needed. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. You all have my unending humble gratitude.  Second, so many of you have asked, so I absolutely will provide updates as this goes along. I suppose just by editing this post?  Unless there’s a better way. I dunno. Feel free to give me pointers in that department. I’m not thinking outside of the box well right now.  Third, rest assured I will come clean to my friends , family and everyone in the program. I’m gonna concentrate on detoxing first, and then I’ll put on my big boy panties and start with my sponsor. For those of you who were wondering, I’m not keeping it secret in order to keep up my sobriety year number, it was more out of a necessity to keep my job, my house, etc. as far as coming clean goes, the real reason I want to do it is less out of a fear of easier relapse, and more out of a desire to show others in the rooms and seeking sobriety that one can come back from a relapse and get clean again... that it doesn’t have to be the end of the line, or a reason to give up on getting clean. I want to be a means to help others achieve sobriety.  Fourth, as of right now it has been 45 hours since my last use, and dear god do I feel like shit. Just typing out this edit has taken a few hours because I have been getting uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting, shaking all over, sweating like a pig, horrific stomach cramps, my legs feel like they’re being constantly stabbed all over, and my joints feel like someone has a lighter to the inside of them, and that’s not even mentioning the mental stuff, the anxiety and confusion.  And lastly, I know it’s spelled Fiend.   I dunno, like I said my brain ain’t braining so good right now.  Again, thank you thank you thank you for everything. I am just blown away and so touched. The only way I can repay y’all is by keeping at it and staying clean.  EDIT 3: Withdrawals are getting really bad now. I’m sorry but I’m just gonna knock myself out and try to update later, if anyone is still watching this that is. I’m gonna call my “nurse” from my dealers text and have her come watch/help me for a bit. In all honesty she’s my ex. She also won’t let me use. That’s why I trust her to watch me.  I’m craving pickles and honey.  I feel like I should be pregnant or so nothing. Separately a mean. I don’t want them both now at once. Anyway I haven’t ate since I stopped using and I hope this helps. Just been drinking as much Gatorade as I can, brought two big bags full of bottles.  Edit yet again:  I am still sober. I made it through the worst parts without using the suboxen, and today is day 11.  I go back to work tomorrow. I’m feeling as close to normal as I think I’m gonna get for awhile. I’m still dealing with some post-acute withdrawal stuff, anxiety and depression, but I am doing much much better physically. I called my sponsor and told him I fucked up and I needed to talk big time. He’ll be back in town this week and we’ll meet up to talk at that point.  I can’t explain to you how hard this kick was. It gets worse and worse every time and I about lost my mind. Until I have in and had someone come help me a bit the only thing getting me through was reading the kind and encouraging words from the people who commented on this thread and sent me messages and told me I was loved and cared for. I know that the rest of the fight still lies before me, but getting through this detox would have been impossible without y’all. I mean that. Thank you for everything, Reddit.",Tomorrow's probably gonna suck but please stick with it. You've done it before so you can do it again!!!,607

I met this girl on hot or not who said she wanted to “ have her way w me” so i was like “ dope im gonna get some good strange for my first time.” I decided to meet up w her on a friday night. I waited for my parents to go to sleep then snuck out my window w/ my dads keys and stole his car to meet this girl i had never met irl. I call her on my parents house phone right before i sneak out to make sure she knows im coming over( they took my cell phone at night). So i get there and guess what? She not there -_-. I drive back to the McDonalds down the road from her place and call her using the phone number i had written on my handwritten google maps directions ( again had no cell). She tells me she will be home in 30 minutes so i wait it out. I go there around 1230 am and shes waiting for me out on the porch. I walk up and i was like “ oh shit, shes alot less attractive than in her pics ,  but im already here and went thru this much shit to get here so fuck it why not. We do the thang while on the floor and two days later i got ringworm on my ass cheek. I also neglected to tell her i was a virgin till i was done smashing.

I would call her fat like all the other kids did, not understanding the impact my words had on her self esteem years down the line. I would take back every insult I ever told her if I could. She’s being awarded the presidential award at university this weekend for the 4.0 GPA she’s maintained all throughout school so far. And she’s so, so pretty. Her weight nor her looks never defined her or held her back and I’m so proud of her.",2036
bl1qvd,"Some background info needed. I come from a mixed race Muslim family and grew up in a small post-9/11 midwestern town so there was a lot of bullying towards me and my siblings. Durring a school football game my younger brother was watching, one of the guys that bullied us, lets call him Chad (who was in the same grade as me), threw a water bottle at my lil bros face. My brother (a 7th grader) had to walk home with a swollen eye and my mom had to put ice on it to get the swelling to go down. He wouldn't tell her who did it but he told me. This fliped a switch in my head. My brother was a bullied a lot more than me on account he was younger, slightly effeminate and had dark skin like our father. Meanwhile I was a year older, tall for my age and white like my mom so I didn't have it close as bad as him. Anyway. Chad would leave school out one of the back exits to save time on his walk home. I knew nobody else left that way so when school got out the next Monday I followed him. I ran after him and started chocking him from behind like I had seen in action movies. Maybe it was because of the adrenalin but I started screaming all kinds of crap at him. The cliche ""dont mess with my family"" stuff.  I left him unconscious behind the school and went home. This was the first and last time I used violence against someone. I never told anyone and neither did he so I wasn't punished for this.  Chad turned up to school the next day and everything was back to normal. The only thing that changed was that Chad and his friends stopped harassing me and my bro. To this day I still think he had it coming. Edit: if I'm being honest while I was choking Chad and screaming at him I was also balling my eyes out. Yea...fighting didn't suit me Edit 2: I was the same age as the other kid. Sorry I didnt mean to make the title of this post so confusing",\> turned up to school the next day and everything was back to normal. schools are a strange ecosystem,2659
bls8vr,"So I worked as a window washer in my small town in Sweden for about 5 years. Every morning you went to the warehouse were we had all of our stuff, drank a cup of coffee with your co-workers and talked for a bit before getting to know the places you had to go to that day, and who you had to do them with. Our bosses were very keen on everyone getting to know everyone so they changed up the ""teams"" every day. This meant sometimes you got to go out by yourself. A typical workday is going to 4-5 houses and/or apartments, sometimes old people (they were always home), sometimes familys who were home because they knew we were coming. Not very often, you got people who left their key under the mat and let us go inside without them being home. I likes this the most, since you didn´t have anyone breathing down your neck while you worked. And sometimes, once in a blue moon, you got a house, with nobody home, by yourself. I don't know if there´s something wrong with me (maybe). But to me it felt like I had struck gold, because I knew, I would be able to walk around that house, by myself, checking out every inch of it. I usally started by doing my job super fast! Make sure I had some way of knowing if they got home. Usally I placed a ladder somewhere close to the door so if someone came home they had to move it. Then I got to work. I NEVER looked to steal anything, it was pure curiosity. I looked through bathroom cabinets, nightstands, desk drawers and basically anything that you could open, while making sure everything I touched was placed back exactly where  it was before. &#x200B; During my years I´ve found diaries with dark secrets, cute secrets and just downright wierd secrets. I´ve found used condoms in the teenage boys room, dildos and vibrators in the daughters/mothers nightstands.I found a gun under a matress (which in Sweden is not something you see everyday) One couple had a sex-swing hanging in the bedroom, so it´s not really something I needed to look for but I thought it was strange that they didn't take it down when they knew people were going to be in the house. I once opened a teenagers Macbook, and BOOM, Pornhub, paused mid-video. No password. No incognito window, nothing. Jewelry, expensive watches and knifes. One kid had a 3 knifes welded toghether like a ninjastar but with a handle. &#x200B; Like I said. Never stole anything. That wasn't my goal. I just loved going though other peoples shit. &#x200B; It´s wrong. I know that. But I couldn´t help myself.","Weirdest secret you found in a diary, go. Also darkest & cutest while you’re at it.

bmi54r,"In high school I played football and I was pretty tall and big. When walking to classes it actually kind of sucked because I had to stop to let people go into doors so I wouldn’t run into kids because I could accidentally knock somebody over.  I had another friend on team who walked with me to class and we would occasionally fuck around in the hallway by pushing each other, just dumb shit. We were messing around when he pushes me when we’re making a turn down the hallway, and I backup and feel something against me.  I look down an a poor girl, who was probably a freshman, is laying on the ground. Absolutely terrified. I go down to help her up and my friend still doesn’t understand what’s happening and thinks we’re still messing around, so he pushes me again and I almost ended up trampling her. She got up on her own and rushed down the hallway probably with tears in her eyes because I had just knocked her into a brick wall and onto the ground.  I never got reported to a teacher so I’m assuming she had no injuries. This wasn’t the last time something like this happened. I was walking to class after lunch when a friend came over and pushed me as a joke. I said “Get away from me” at the exact same time a girl accidentally hit me while walking by, looked at me super offended and walked off.",Even in a large high school you had to have seen the first girl again sometime that school year.

bmjpxu,"Ok so I was taking Year 12 Multi-Science, which was basically the deadshit version of the real science classes available at my school (Biology, Chemistry  and Physics). It wasn’t too bad, it just wasn’t as practicable as the other science classes. So 8 weeks out from the end of the term (meaning end of class, start of holidays), we got this assignment. I honestly don’t know what it was about, because I didn’t do it, but it was this stack of pages that we needed to fill out. Long story short, I didn’t do any of it. Not a word. The day finally came when we had to hand the assignment back in. It was a normal lesson, but at the end of the lesson the teacher said “ok assignments are due today, everyone hand them up” and everyone shuffled up to the front of the room and put their assignments on his desk in a pile. I didn’t get up and he didn’t notice. The next day the teacher came up to me and at morning tea:  Teacher: Mattio, your assignment wasn’t in the pile with the others, where is it?  Me: What, no, I handed it up yesterday?? I specifically remember it because (student) handed his up before mine.  Teacher: Yeah..ok. I’ll have another look.  I ended up getting a B+ on that assignment. At the time I thought I’d pulled a quick one on a stupid adult authority figure and gotten away with it, which felt really cool, but I learned a couple of years later that I was on suicide watch at the time, so that probably had something to do with the leniency.",The fucking last part...,538
bmp59h,"Year's ago I worked as a security guard at a homeless shelter in Boulder, CO. It was a chill gig and everyone there loved me. I brought treats and gifts for all the people I met there and did what I could to help despite having a major drug addiction problem and facing homelessness myself at the time.  So when I was first there I met this man we'll call 'Sev'. He was very bi-polar but was a loving dude at heart who was also battling addiction and depression. We would spend hours a day talking and I watched him progress from having nothing to almost owning his own apartment within a few months. I was so proud of the dude and was excited for his new life he created for himself. He had a new job, new clothes, a bike and a cell phone, little things he just didn't have while living on the street. Seeing that kind of progress always gave me hope for myself. So one day he came in limping, pale and just like he was on the brink of death. Me and the other residents at the shelter asked him about it and he seemed to just blow us off, not admitting anything to anyone. The other guards said he relapsed and was just drunk. Being an alcoholic myself I didn't buy it. It got progressively worse and worse as the days went on.  One day he didn't come home during his curfew. Everyone was looking for him, calling his phone, checking his regular hang-out places. Nobody had seen him. I was working the night shift and a police officer came buy and dropped him off. He couldn't even hold himself up. The smell coming off his body was a mixture of just about every bodily fluid you can excrete. I had to carry him to his room or else he would he wouldn't have moved. Apparently they found him in a ditch by a lake or something...  The next few days were spent in his room with other homeless people doing what little they could to help. I knew this wasn't a drinking binge. I asked if I could call the ambulance and my bosses said there was nothing I was allowed to do if I wanted to keep my job. I guess he drank Antifreeze a few days before and it takes a week to fully die. He went in probably the most painful way you can go. It still haunts me. I know there was nothing I could do but still. Dude deserved to live. Nobody knows who he is. He just disappeared. But I remember.   RIP Sev",Yeah antifreeze crystallizes your kidneys. It’s also sweet so lots of pets and feral animals lick it off concrete and die. Sorry for you loss,2625
bn2d3h,So back when I was ten my dad asked me if I wanted to make 20$. I accepted.  The catch I had to shit on our neighbors door step. It was clear my dad had beef with this woman.

bo6vky,"A few years ago I used to work as a substitute teacher. I was in my early twenties when this happened and have felt guilty and ashamed ever since. I can't justify my actions and I accept it was an absolutely idiotic thing for me to do. And in no way is this post an attempt to justify my actions. I think about this atleast a few times a week and feel so ashamed of myself everytime it pops into my head. The memory is normally triggered by songs, associations or thinking of my future. And I guess I still to this day, fear very much it will haunt me in my future adult life. I had been working as a substitute teacher for a few months before this happened. I was met everyday with atleast some form of insults from kids from all different ages. It wasn't anything new for the substitutes to be insulted, mocked or tested by these kids. I shrug off whatever they tried to insult me with (being single and alone, being ugly, you name it). But of course this wasn't every single student, class etc. Everyone were so very different from each other and of course it also depended on their maturity I heard stories of students refusing to do stuff for a teacher because she was of polish descent or students mocking a teacher constantly for being overweight. And because of this I think I always mentally prepared myself for the worst and I had build up this mindset to snap back if it was really needed (scolding them, sending them off, etc.) One day I was having class with some 8th graders. I won't lie, I liked their class. They were mature, nice and knew how to treat each other respectively for the most. I don't know if I ever let my guard down at this point. But there was this girl, she was a good student and was also so very polite. She was on her phone just browsing instagram non-stop. I told her to put the phone down, but she kept at it. I shrugged it off because I knew me keeping telling her to put it away would be a waste of time and energy. At some point i'm sitting at a table with only 2 guys and said girl in the classroom, alone. The others had scattered to do their assignment somewhere else. We start talking about social media and who is really is the most active of all the classmates. The boys quickly point out the girl and start talking about how she is always posting stuff, normal everyday stuff, fashion and sometimes content that would lean a bit more to the mature side. Before I really give what i'm about to say a thought, I blur out ""are you a bit of a social media slut? As in do you post every single moment you can of your life online?"" The guys laugh and I guess at this point I had never idea what I really just called her. A few days later a teacher approaches me and asks me if I called one of her students a slut. At this point I realize what i've done. I tell the teacher I of course didn't mean to offend or hurt the girl. I ran out from the teachers lounge as it was still recess and I found the girl. I tell I feel very bad for what I called her and that it was incredibly wrong of me to say such a thing. And try my hardest that I was in no way trying to hurt her. She smiles and nods and tells me it's okay, but i'm still just shaking inside my body. I tell her to have a good next class. The recess ends and I move on to my next class. The entire car ride home I feel so ashamed of myself as a person and how I could say such a thing to a person at her age. And that's my confession. I'm not trying yo justify any of this. It's simply some guilt I don't think I can ever shake off myself and I hope other people will do better than what I did that day. I was of course fired and sent my employer a final message telling them how I understod why they termitnated me and that i'm deeply sorry for the inconvenience I caused. I'm sorry for my english as i'm from europe. I hope you could make some sense from it. I'm sorry.",You screwed up. The proper term is social media *whore*.,2216

bp185z,I was vegan when we started living together but I gave up since then and I started stealing anything I can get my hands on. They never suspect me because they think I wouldn't eat those items.  Never been even close to being caught.   I always make sure to cook when nobody is home or to hide packaging and wrappers in my trash.  It's more about the fact that I can do it without consequences that makes me do it. Nobody complained about missing food items more that a couple of times so I dont think I am that much of a nuisance.    Edit: Just wanted to clarify a few things.  I dont lie about being vegan. Other people in my life know I am not a vegan anymore and I dont lie or hide this fact from anyone. The people I live with are never really around to socialise so they never had the chance to find out about it.  Also if they ever said something about being upset or really in a bad situation because of my actions I would definetly stop. My reasoning is that I dont take a lot or that what I take was going to go to waste anyway( Food constantly goes bad in the fridge). This is no way me trying to get away from the fact that what I'm doing is wrong.  I know I souldnt be doing it but it's a bit of an addiction.,You are the enemy of the people.,3045
bp86tx,"I (legally) take a stimulant for a medical issue. I'm very open about my mental health and medication with co-workers and friends because I believe it's the only way to help others seek help for themselves sometimes. Now with saying that, there are always people who are nefariously trying to convince me to give them a pill or two because ""what if it helps them"". I always tell them to talk to their doctor if they truly believe they have a disorder. So there is one co-worker of mine who (not so subtly) jokes about me handing him some of my medication at work every now and then. I've always shut him down in a joking way, but we both know neither of us are actually joking. It's never really been a huge problem, just slightly annoying, and I didn't think much of it until last week. From here on I'll refer to this co-worker as W. Now, I usually keep my things out in my car since I don't have an office or locker to safely store them. This one particular day though, it was getting pretty hot outside (yay for summer) and I had complained to a few co-workers at lunch about my laptop possibly overheating in my car. Everyone else agreed it was shitty of management to not provide lockers and we all laughed it off. Everyone except W. W kinda piped up amidst the discussion and said ""You know, you can totally put your stuff in my office if you'd like, you know, so your computer is safe."" I thanked him and continued on my way. It didn't really occur to me at that time that he had any other motive other than being nice. About an hour later, W saw me in passing and said, ""Hey! I thought you were going to store your things in my office?"" It was at that moment I started seeing the big picture. So I smiled and agreed, ""Yup! Sorry, I just got busy! I'll go grab my bag and bring it up in a minute!"" So I went to my car, gathered my things and kinda sat there for a second in the sweltering heat of my car thinking. I would never accuse someone of stealing and generally expect the best out of people at my workplace, but it didn't sit right with me that W brought the whole situation up again and hour later when I had just made a quick comment that one time. I decided to take my meds out of my bag and store them in the center console. Well, I took the stimulants out. What most people don't know is that I'm also prescribed an anti-anxiety medication, but I don't usually talk about it because I rarely take it. It mostly makes me sleepy and doesn't help throughout the day, only at night on rare occasions. The pills also look VERY similar to my stimulants. I kept that bottle in the bag. For clarification, I DID NOT switch pills or bottles, the anti-anxiety meds clearly state what it is. I DID, however, have a sneaking suspicion that W had something in mind other than allowing me to safely store my belongings in his office, and was curious if he'd actually try to take one. I ended up putting my stuff down in his office (he looked almost TOO happy to help), thanked him again and went about my business. Maybe another hour later I returned to grab something from my bag and W had a look on his face that screamed I FUCKED UP. He mentioned that he was not feeling well and his eyes were kinda droopy. He went home early that day. Now I know it was kinda fucked up of me to bait him like I did, but if he was a smart thief, he'd have read the bottle. And if he was a good person, he wouldn't have touched my shit in the first place. I counted the pills when I got home and sure enough 2 were missing. TWO PILLS. Just one of those bad boys puts me on my ass. I have no idea if he took one and saved one or if he took both, but I know the look of sedation when I see it. In the end, W was fine. He came to work the next day looking guilty AF and mostly avoided me. We both know what he did, but he can't say anything without confessing to stealing MY medication. All in all, I feel like he might have learned his lesson, though I do feel bad for setting it up. He hasn't said a word about my meds this week and I still don't have somewhere safe to put my things this summer, but I'm sure W got a fan-fucking-tastic nights sleep that day.",No one likes a W,1012

bvr75j,"This happened about 4 years ago when I was apart of the school newspaper my sophomore year of high school. A little backstory: This teacher was the “young hot teacher” so I naturally was crushing on her, like most of the other guys in my school lol. She was super nice, definitely one of favorites and we grew into a nice “teacher-student” friendship. We still keep in contact actually, she’s helped me with resumes and college quite a bit. Onto the story: One day I was assigned to do an article about our schools culinary program, they had made a big garden so they could have fresh veggies and herbs. I had finished writing the article and was told to go take pictures, but I had no way to take these pictures. The newspaper didn’t have any cameras so students would just use their phones but I didn’t have a smartphone at the time. My teacher gave me her phone and told me to take the pictures with that. I took her phone and was making my way down the hall to the culinary garden when I had this thought. “My teacher crush just gave me her phone, I’m alone, and there could be nudes on this thing...” I’ve used an iPad before so I knew my way around an iPhone.  Now what else would a horny teenager do? I started going through the photos, there were tons of pictures of her and her husband, friends, pets, etc. I started thinking “she’s not dumb enough to give her student something with her nudes on it” but I kept scrolling, then it appeared, a full frontal mirror nude... Holy shit I thought I found the holy grail, my heart started beating so fast in that quiet ass hallway I swear you could’ve heard it. I clicked on it and instantly got rock hard. I proceeded to walk to the garden though so I kept it together and got those pictures. The whole time I was taking them I still had a boner (tucked into my waistband obviously) Now I’m walking back to my teacher, heart still beating hella hard, horny as fuck. “This is going to be the only time I see my teacher naked so better get the most out of it” I thought. I go into the bathroom, lock the stall, and rub one out over my teachers phone. It didn’t take long at all and I busted the biggest nut. I clean myself up, close the photos app, click the camera app so it looks like I didn’t do anything but take pictures, then make my way to the class. I walk in and hand her the phone, she smiles and says “get those pictures alright?” I reply “yep!” I go sit down while she transfers the pictures to her computer and emails them to me.  I finish my article and email it to our class editor and that was the end of it. She never found out and she never asked about it to this day. I’ve never told anyone this story before today and it’ll remain a secret, I sure as hell don’t want her to know I did this lol Edit: since a lot of people are saying that this was  a violation of her privacy and I was a creep for doing this - I know it was and I’ll admit it was creepy.

(This girl is like he sweetest person you will ever meet. She’s always ready to help anyone and she doesn’t have a mean bone in her body.)

So I threw my pen across the room as if it was a tic and stood up to go get it. As I walked past asshole one and two, I made a similar sound to what I make when I tic and slapped this dude across the face. I immediately started apologizing and making my eyes water. I act a lot so I know how to cry on demand. He was pissed but he stopped bothering the girl and afterwards the girl came up to me and thanked me. I played dumb and she left.

Even if they never notice the extra petty 1.29 in the price (which they never do because they don’t fucking listen to my mouth words) it gives me a tiny bit of spiteful satisfaction and it doesn’t hurt them at all since most of those dollars come from full ride scholarships/parents.","This reminds me of a story my mom did for the city paper (she was a photographer) that had a wealthy private university in it. All of the kids at the end of the year would leave year-old TVs, couches, stereos, you name it; because mommy and daddy would buy them all new things for the following school year. They would just stick them out by the dumpster or on the side of the street. Then everyone else just goes to town!",1106
bytfyv,"Back story to this, my parents split up weeks before she was deployed back in 2004. I at the time blamed her based on her actions following the family break up. She even remarried before she left the states. I refused to talk to her, I was 11 at the time. I was so angry I eventually started telling people in my school my mom died. It was mainly in response to people asking me of my personal life and what my mother does. It was a very social part of growing up, when people start inquiring about you. Anyways, fast forward to her coming home for 2 weeks, she showed up to my school. Keep in mind I was attending therapy during this time provided by the school and the counselor is who arranged the visit. She did a small speech to my class answering vague questions about the military and her involvement. It was my schools way of dealing with 9/11. Boosting the approval of military personnel, making it more of the norm. Mid speech a fellow student raises her hand and straight up says “your son told me you died”. The room was so silent. I never felt so small. She hesitated and followed with a nervous laugh saying “obviously that’s not true” transitioning into more answers not involving my terrible decision. To this day we never spoke about it.","Similar thing happened to me but the opposite way... My mom died when I was 8 and word got around my elementary school and all the kids were asking me if it was true  I denied it.  I said she was alive and that it was all made up.  It was right around the time of mother day and I remember that the teacher had us making cards to give to our moms when one of my classmates said “ what about michael. His mom died “ and I jumped up and said “ no she’s not. She’s alive!” After class my teacher pulled me aside and asked me why I was denying her death , I continued with the lie that she was alive until they called my dad to confirm that in fact she was dead  Looking back it’s extremely cringy to think about but just like in your situation Op, I think it was a coping mechanism that got out of hand",1424
c0i449," So I (22F) work at a big law firm as a Paralegal. My colleague (30F) is also a paralegal. We’ve both been working there for 2 years. She can be dramatic and gossip-y but other than that she’s good at what she does.  She started treating me different ever since my proposal to go part-time got accepted by the executive (due to studies). A lawyer that I’m close with even told me that my colleague said that I suck up to the lawyers (idk how true this is. maybe it was just a misunderstanding? I’m just kind to everyone).  So she got accepted in a different job last week and she’ll be leaving soon. We’re all contributing to get her a farewell gift and she really wants this expensive make up set from Sephora (she can’t afford expensive make up because she lives paycheck to paycheck) .Well this week I found out that she blocked me on Facebook for no apparent reason. I thought two can play at that game. The next day at work, I took back my $30 contribution towards her gift and we’re now short on her make up set. Nobody knows how much I donated because I’m the one who is in charge of counting the money and collecting donations.  Hey Kate, you’re getting a gift card to a department store instead. Edit: I took my OWN $30 contribution back which I donated in the first place. Yes I know it’s better to kill with kindness, but I’m not going to put my  own hard earned money to reward someone who attempted to destroy my image in a field which I will be potentially working in.

c11din,"I can't tell anyone this, even my therapist. Lambast me if you wanr and maybe I even deserve it. I only ask what you would do if you were in my situation. Not what you think ""people should"" do. What you would REALLY do.  I'm a single mom of 2 boys. 12 and 7. My husband passed away 3 years ago in a work accident. A very large portion of me believe it was a suicide. I can't see him EVER making the mistake he made that caused his death, and he had taken an action just before that which ensured his co-workers weren't in the room. I fully believe he killed himself because of our younger son and no one will ever change my mind.  We were told when I was pregnant that he would have Downs Syndrome. We could handle that. Even if it was severe. It turned out he has a chromosome deletion. His disorder is kind of rare so I won't post which specific one but suffice to say he'll never be anything more than he is now or has ever been.  And what he is, is nothing.  He doesn't appear to have any awareness and never has. His eyes are locked in one position, he doesn't respond to noise, touch, or pain. He is total care. He is capable of nothing. He is tube fed and on oxygen. He is in diapers and will be forever. He makes no sounds, no attempts to communicate. He never even really cried as a baby. He has never made an attempt to interact with anyone or his environment.  I'm not upset because I got a special needs/""imperfect"" child. I feel the way I feel because this...... thing..... takes up 200% of my time and does NOTHING. I didn't get an imperfect child. I didn't get *a child*.  I don't love him. He doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. And yet I'm responsible for him. In addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. Respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his G tube, infections, pressure sores no matter WHAT we put him on or how we position him.  Our older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. He's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. We do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. I was starting law school, I gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. My older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments.  The final straw was I heard a sound. I went into Younger Son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw Older Son hitting him and screaming ""You're why I don't have a mother! You're why I don't have a father! You're why I can't have friends over! You're why I can't be in sports! I didn't ask for you and I hope you die!""  Instead of being horrified, I watched. And Younger Son just did. not. react. No signs of pain or fear or upset. No reaction at all.  He breathes but he is not alive. He doesn't know who I am. He doesn't know who Older Son is. He has no sense of self, life experience, or awareness of his surroundings.  He doesn't need to be in my home. He doesn't know or care where he is. He is genetically my son but he is not family. My previously abused, brain damaged cat who can't walk straight has more personality and is far more loveable than my ""child"". In fact I was looking FORWARD to raising a Downs baby. Even one with severe impairments, for that reason. With disability can come gifts. This boy is not a gift. He is a genetic mistake I probably should have miscarried and would have definitely terminated if I'd known he would be like this. And the flip side is, if he HAS awareness..... he's miserable. And there is nothing I can do. If he has likes and dislikes no one knows what they are. If he is in pain he can't tell anyone. If he wants anything, he can't communicate. He's had every imaginable therapy, nothing has made a difference.  And so he's leaving our home on the 29th. I feel excited and relieved and then guilty because I know we'll be happier with him gone.  He's already taken my husband and my son's father. He was working so so so much OT to pay for the cucumber's care. For the experimental therapies insurance wouldn't cover. Because THIS one was going to be the BREAKTHROUGH. He was tired and defeated and disappointed. He sought counseling as well but I don't think he could ever say the words ""I don't want my son in my home"" either.  He's ruined my older son. I was so wrapped up on the younger I never realized how ignored and damaged he was. He lost his father too. I didn't just lose my husband. HE is my priority now and this malignant lump can be someone else's problem. At least they'll be paid a wage to care for him. At least they'll get a break from him when they punch out.  I just want to never think of him again and I'm not sorry. And for that, I'm sorry.  Thanks for reading. Edit: Thanks /u/piconeeks, for calling me a liar. Are you a medical doctor? If your Google Fu was any good you would have stumbled on 3p mosaic deletion-duplication syndrome. That is the disorder my son has. I've basically identified myself by posting that but hey, it's better than the PMs telling me to kill myself. If you look at the features of 3p deletion syndromes *they look like Downs*. My insurance didn't cover AFP testing which would have told us it WASN'T Downs and I didn't think we needed it. I had a regular ultrasound and a 3D. Both Drs were ""99% sure it was Downs"".  This post was absolutely NOT fiction. Instead the mods and especially /u/piconeeks just ""decided"" it was.  If anyone would like I'll doxx myself. You can see my ID to verify my name, my marriage license, and my husband's death certificate. I will then link you to the news article of the ""freak industrial accident"" that ended his life so you can see it's the same person.  As for not choosing hospice for my son - I can't. About a year ago I myself was hospitalized with severe depression and C-PTSD (there is proof of that too). During that time my late husbands mother petitioned to get control as my son's medical proxy and got it. I'm fighting it but it's a long, complicated process. There are competency hearings. There are statements from doctors and evaluations. Unless SHE oks hospice, which she refuses, I cannot decide that. I have custody. I cannot ake medical decisions. She agreed to residential care which I feel is the second best option. So, he's going into residential care.  As for ""mistaking"" a child choking with hitting, I was downstairs. I couldn't hear what my older son was saying. I only knew he was speaking. Go punch a blanket or, idk, a person with weak muscle tone. Then ask said person with weak muscle done to cough. They don't cough normally/forcefully. It's more a ""strong puff"". Similar to, again.... idk... a muted punch. When you're used to jumping at every strange sound, it's difficult to discern what's what sometimes.  So, /u/piconeeks..... anything else you'd like to know? Care to admit I *just might be* telling the truth? There were identify details I left out but guess y'all need them.","Take your other son to Disney or some other vacation for a week on the 30th. Also, get counseling for him and for you when you get home.",9952
c1cuoj,"Years ago, I had silly dreams about making a youtube career of showcasing abysmal porn stories and fan fiction, reading them with stupid voices, and providing commentary. It never happened, most of my videos topped out at 50 views, and it just wasn't very fun. But, while that dream was at the forefront of thoughts, I discovered a website. It was a site designed for My Little Pony porno fan-fics. This was right around the time that show was popular with grown-ass adults. As an addendum, I will go to my grave insisting that bronies are just furries in denial. Anyway, the site was relatively small. No forums or actual accounts. You could comment under whatever name you wanted, and leave another comment three seconds later with a different name, and nobody would know. And, the most questionable site decision was that *anyone* could upload stories, and *anyone* could delete the stories that were already present.  I decided to fuck with a couple entries. One I deleted outright, two had their original stories replaced with some single-line nonsense I thought was funny at the time. And I added two new stories myself, both of which were short, non-sexual, and totally irrelevant to cartoon horses. And that was where I intended to leave off... Until I saw their reaction the next day. People were *freaking the fuck out* over this incredibly small, easily-undone bit of vandalism. I saw comments about ""troll hackers"", massive comments deriding the site mods (as far as I knew, the site never had any mods) for ""policing our work"", and at least one guy going on tirades about how he couldn't believe that the site was ""being targeted"". And I was weak. I couldn't resist. I deleted the story again, added more of own trash, and I added a comment claiming that ""This entry has been flagged for deletion as it goes against our policy. Please do not re-upload it."" The freakout escalated. People were rioting in the comments section. I jumped in, claiming that I was just a user this time, and that I stood firmly behind the mods. If they say a story should be taken down, by god, they had that right. And every time it was uploaded again, I deleted it and added more shitposts. Then, something wonderful happened. A miracle. Other, totally genuine users on the site started assisting me. ""Will you people follow the rules and stop uploading this fucking story?!"" they would post, as they went out of *their* way to delete it. People started impersonating each other in the comments, stories were being deleted left and right, actual trolls jumped in to fuck with the site their own way... It was a shitshow, and I was laughing my ass off at what I had done.  And then one day, the site was gone. There was no warning, no explanation, it was just a dead link one day. I googled it, and there was almost no trace of it. Except for a brand-new entry on some other pony-porn forum. ""Does anybody know what happened to that site?"" And the answer nearly brought a tear of joy to my eye. ""I know it was having serious issues with coordinated trolling and harassment, so I'm pretty sure they shut it down."" Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that the site would get nuked off the internet, all because of some minor vandalism on my end. First I laughed my ass off, then I felt kinda bad, then I laughed my ass off again.  It was just an archive for terrible fan-fiction about cartoon horses fucking each other. There was no community aspect, not until I accidentally created a civil war in the comments. I'm sure I'll catch some flak from the ""furries are sacrosanct"" crowd, but that's why I posted this with an anonymous throwaway account.  I accidentally murdered a terrible pony porn site nearly a decade ago. This is my confession. I have no regrets. Edit: Wow, my first silver, for a confession about furry porn on a throwaway account. My mother would be so proud. Edit 2: Someone locked the comments. Thank you kindly, they were getting really hard to keep track of.","This is by far the best confession I have ever read, you sir deserve a medal",1697
c1m7nf,"throwaway account because of obvious reasons. &#x200B; When I was 15 I had some of my friends over while I was watching my 11 year old brother. My parents worked a night shift and I had to babysit him often. Which I did not mind because I'd usually bring my friends over, and my brother wouldn't care really. It was around 10:00 pm and it was on a Friday and my brother was asleep so we wanted to have some fun. So one of my friends brought over weed. We were in my room and one of my friends knew how to block the smell of the weed with this thing he made that would block the weed smell so we could smoke in the house. After we all ended up getting high we decided we wanted to chill in the basement. We were down there for around 15 minutes. Eventually we wanted to go up to my room again. When we opened the basement door the whole house was foggy and smelled like smoke and I could see the fire spreading to our downstairs living room area since our house was two stories. I grabbed my phone and I opened the exit of the basement door and me and my friends ran out as quickly as possible while I called 911. My brother was upstairs sleeping and all I could remember was just crying, coughing and being so dizzy from the shock and the smoke. I called my parents too and they rushed home and they got here after the ambulance and firefighters. When my parents got home the fire in the house was gone and I remember the paramedics rushing my brother on a stretcher  into the ambulance. My mom went in the ambulance with my brother and my dad drove us to the hospital. We found out most of his body had 3rd degree burns, and he was unstable and unconscious due to the smoke. I was not allowed to see my brother while I was there and I had to keep waiting for my mom and dad to tell me everything was ok. My parents and I stayed at the hospital all night and a little into the morning and eventually my mom and dad came out (because they were allowed to see him) to tell me that he was passing away due to the smoke inhalation. After our house was investigated for what could have started the fire we were told that it started in my room and they found a metal lighter. I remember bursting into tears telling my parents why I had a lighter in my room and what happened and I remember saying it was all my fault. To this day I still feel the worst amount of guilt for what happened, and my parents have told me so many times that I didn't know that this would happen. They said they weren't angry with me but I still feel like they had some sort of anger towards me at that moment. The house was completely gone, and we were lucky we had insurance and were even able to afford a new one. &#x200B; I'm 20 now, and I go to college and have a part time job, but the guilt still haunts me so much and I think about how my brother would have gone on to do amazing things. I know deep down that it wasn't completely my fault and that I didn't know this would happen, but it still did. My mom and dad tell me all the time that they aren't angry with me and that I was young and didn't know that this would have happened.","False post accusations are not allowed.

c2qe5f,"Forgive me for any misspellings or format I’m trying to do this on my phone.  I haven’t talked about this to anyone (even though it’s been years) even my closest of friends, minus the ones that were there. One nite when I was in college I was driving to get some liquor for a party my fraternity was supposed to throw the following night. I was taking a street I was very familiar with to get back to my house.  It was dark but the street was lit with street lamps.  I remember that I looked at my radio for a second, just a second not very long at all.  But when I looked back up to the road  there was a man crossing. I didn’t have any time to react, by the time I saw him he had already hit the good of my car and bounced off the side.  I remember screaming and hitting the brakes, and the wash of horror of what had just happened.  I’ll admit I had thought about speeding away, but I pulled over to the side and ran out of my car to check on this guy. When I got to him his family was standing outside the restaurant he was leaving and they were all screaming and crying.  He has laying on the side of the road with blood coming out his nose and mouth. Two other men were standing with him trying to see if he was alright and calling 911.  All I could say was “I didn’t see him” I was frantic by the time it had set in what I had done. I sat on the curb across from the family and listened to their crying in agony while we waited for the paramedics to arrive.  I sat there and sobbed while to paramedics took him away in an ambulance.  I don’t believe I’ve ever cried so hard and for so long.  The worst part about all of it and what still kills me today was that his wife came over to me while I was distraught on that curb, sat next to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said “I was married to him for almost 50 years.  We had a good life.” Then she hugged me and said that she forgave me.    After everything was said and done it was ruled that it was an accident.  I wasn’t charged with anything and I had one of my friends pick me up from the police station.  I went down a dark path the years after that.  I drank heavily, dropped out of college in my senior year, and had to move back in with my mother and father because I couldn’t hold on to a job.  Even tried to kill myself with pills.  It was a hard road to recovery (witch I feel I’m not fully recovered from nor do I feel I ever will be the same). But eventually I got my life back in order.  Joined up with the Navy and saw a bit of the world, and now I’m on track to go back to college and hopefully finish what I started there.   It took almost a decade but I finally start to feel almost whole again.  I’m back to hanging with my friends, and actually going out.  So maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Wow, you guys are awesome! Thanks for the support and feedback.  I’ve never really posted anything on reddit before because people can be assholes, but all these kind words are moving. Thank you!

c3sxsu,"Just to be clear, this wasn't because I was particularly hungry, its because my coworker was an absolute asshole. He was really creepy toward the girls in the office and always said some pretty weirdly racist shit to our other coworker who was from mexico. He was just a crude, horribly annoying person who seemingly took enjoyment out of making everyone around him uncomfortable. He was like a mix of Todd Packer from the Office and Tony Soprano. He always brought these apple chips into work to eat for lunch, and occasionally I would go in, take the apple chips, and go to the nearby park and eat them for lunch. He would go around asking everyone if they took the chips and would act all pissed off because he knew someone took them.  Instead of just flat out telling him I'm allergic to apples, I put on a little show. He was eating his chips 2 days before I started to take them, and I asked if I could have one, and I took one and almost took a bite, then said ""these aren't apple flavored are they?"" and he said they were, then I quickly put it back on the plate and went to go wash my hands and I said I was allergic.

I got put on laundry duty early on and was required to wash and dry clothes for the whole platoon with a couple other guys. I was fresh out of high school and had rarely helped my mom do the wash, so I didn't know the difference between detergent and bleach.  I added both liberally to the washing machine after loading it with T-shirts and briefs.   Over the next couple of days people started appearing wearing T-shirts with bleached out spots.

Edit: For those asking why she came in the next day: I don't know that we got paid bereavement time there (I doubt we did, but I can't verify because I never had to check into it). If it wasn't paid, I'm guessing she needed the money. If it was paid, she may have planned to use it closer to/on the date of the funeral.  When my grandpa passed (while I was at a different employer, which was in retail), his viewing was on Black Friday. I worked that morning and spent the rest of the day at the funeral home. I only used one day of bereavement for the day off the funeral. I don't remember if I was scheduled the day after he passed, but if I was, I was there.",5897
cetye8,"When I was 19 I was running late to work in my tiny POS economy car and on fumes of gas I didn’t come to a complete stop on a right turn. Lights behind me so I pull over. I know I’ve barely got any gas at all and was almost to a gas station, hence why I rolled through the stop a little. Trying not to have the car die.  At the time (around 1995) a new digital phone had come out called Voicesteam (now TMoblie) and their whole big thing was the phones were digital and not cellular. They were the first phones with caller ID and one of the big things the salesman had said over and over was since it was digital the signal couldn’t be triangulated or traced. Not that I cared but it stuck in my mind.  Well as I give the cop my license, registration and insurance card I got an idea. I knew if I was late to work I was going to lose my job. They were super strict there.  So I get an idea and right after I hand the papers to the cop and he’s walking back to his cruiser I called 911 and tell the operator I just saw a guy with what looked like a shot gun walk into a 7-11 that was about 2 blocks away. I confirmed the address then I hung up.  About 30 seconds later the cops comes sprinting to my car and hands me all my stuff and rushed says, “come to a complete stop next time!!” Then peels off to the direction of the store.  Pushed my car to the gas station that I’d almost made it to and felt pretty pleased with my ingenuity.  I was an idiot and I confess! Edit: Wow, this blew up.  I forgot to mention I would have gotten arrested, booked and released, because I was driving with a suspended license for unpaid traffic tickets and I had a bench warrant for it.  Because I’m an idiot! So it wouldn’t have been just a few mins late to work. The job was a physical high turn over one that didn’t tolerate much. Thank you to the kind souls giving me these medals/awards!  Don’t think I deserve them but I’ll pass it along to those who do!",Nice work.  I know a gentlemen who called in a bomb threat to the airport back in the lates 70s because he was going to be late.  All flights postponed or cancelled.,4203
chehey,"When I was 14 I found my dad's stash of porn magazines and VHS movies. I played one of the movies (fuck my wife II), after watching, I couldn't get the cassette out, It was stuck, I tried everything, including a knife and a hammer in a panicked state since my parents were coming home from work soon. I ended up stuffing it in my backpack, going out of the house with it and dumping it in a field near my house. My parents must have noticed the porn movie gone with the VHS player because they never asked about it (it was the only one we had and they bought another one right after)","When we are kids we think we are such geniuses and our parents complete morons.

We were at a sort of carnival party where everybody dresses up etc. My girlfriend at the time was with a group of friends she didn't know too well and didn't like either. I was in a group of wrong friends and did wrong things to impress them, like stealing/pickpocketing. At the party I was on a roll and decided to make it a little more exciting (cringe when I think about it now) so I decided to pickpocket the 'friend' of my girlfriend. It worked out and my 'friends' were proud of me which I would have done a lot for in that period.. The haul wasn't even that great but that wasn't even the motivation for me at the time.  Later when we went home we waited on the train and the 'friend' of my girlfriend was crying because she lost her wallet. Which I stole. Her friends were all feeling bad for her, except my girlfriend, and I decided with my dickheadish head to try and console her. It worked for as far as I remember, at least she stopped crying. My girlfriend knew about it and she only laughed about it, eventually we broke up which was one of the last strings between me and my 'evil' friends. I was a dick and learned from it, but for me it was still the most dumb/mean thing I ever did even tho I got away with it..",That was really shitty damn but I guess at least you no longer associate yourself with that group of people and have hopefully learned.

The first time I ever did this was when I was riding my bike in the neighborhood and saw a front door of a home wide open. I peeked in and said ""hello"" just to see if someone was home. No one answered. I stood in the living room just scanning the area and got spooked and left. After that day, I was hooked on it. I would wait for people to leave and enter through which ever door/window was open and would walk around. I never stole anything but I did open drawers, closets and went through personal belongings. I once found a wad of money rolled in up a sock. I took the money and sock and put it in the next drawer over. I felt like I needed to leave a mark so I ended up moving dishes in cabinets. Like, I switched the cups with plates and moved utensil drawers to another spot in the kitchen. I did this in about 8 or 9 homes until people started talking and getting suspicious and of course, people started locking their doors, including our family. I stopped after that.

Using a throwaway because my main account has some personally identifying info. My dad committed suicide early this year and I found his body when I went to visit him. It was a gunshot wound to the head. After I called 911, I stayed inside with his body and in the heat of the moment I snapped a picture of him laying there. The only person who has seen it is my sister. I look at it from time to time and take some odd comfort in seeing it I’m not sure how to explain...

I don’t even really remember what he did, but he said something that made me snap.  This was during my braids phase, and my hair was long enough that I had a decent tool to work with.  I turned my head away from him and waited.  When the chorus teacher wasn’t looking, I whipped him in the face with my braid as hard as I could.  It hit him so hard that he lost his balance and fell off the back riser.

co3od4,"So I am not a fan of cheating and have never cheated in any other class. When I was in highschool, I was forced to take Spanish to graduate. I am not good with language, and living in the southwest I was the only student in the class who didn't already know Spanish. The teacher was therefore unsympathetic and refused to slow down and help. To pass, I needed a solution. I realized on her test days, she would have us use our own sheet of paper. I would make my study sheet on the page before the one I would use for the test and press so hard that I would have it transferred onto the test sheet. This bumped my grades from F's to A""s. Teacher suspected me pulling shenanigans but never caught me. I feel bad, and as an intructor never let students use their own paper on tests.","Funny, I was so bad at Spanish tests that my HS teacher pulled me aside after a test and said, ""Hey Senior...use pencil on your tests"". I had no clue why she was asking I do so, but whatever. Next test I came into the classroom and she handed me a pencil, ""Make sure you use this!"" Again, no clue why but  alright. Next day we got our tests back and I got my first passing grade. I looked closely at my paper and it was obvious she erased half of my answer and gave me enough correct so I didn't fail. I looked up at her and she winked. I ended the semester with a C. Later, I would go to college and after 2 weeks in Spanish One my professor called me over and said, ""You have a learning disability. You'll never learn Spanish in a classroom. Go see the learning disabilities counselor on this sheet of paper"". Battery of tests later and that was the end of Spanish tests for the rest of my life!

cph0hx,"A little background. I live in a tri-city area where 3 of 3 city's have a drug problem and only 2 of 3 show up on the news for it (I live in the ""safer"" city).  I think the main reason I'm addicted is curiosity and depression. The drugs I've tried are (in order of trying them); weed, alcohol, lsd, Adderall, dxm, dph. If I'm not mistaken that means I've tried every type besides opiates and benzos (I'm stupid but not that stupid).  I'm mainly addicted to dxm and dph bc of there easy access. Every time I go to my grandparents house I go to their medicine cabinet and see what I can take. It's gotten to the point that it's all I think about.  And the worst part is, I'm taking everybody down with me, for example one day I went over to my best friend of nearly 4 years to smoke weed and pick up some Adderall he was about to move so we decided to get fucked up (he took 30mg and I took 45) it was great besides him having a small panic attack which ended quite quickly. However about a week (after he moved) later he texted me that he was in the hospital bc he took 90mg xr and didn't eat for 3 days turns out he got hella addicted, which is my fault.  My other best friend of nearly 3 years doesn't do any drugs, and when I told her of my problem(s) I feel like a burden on her life and bc I'm another thing she has to worry about. When I told her about my problem I told her I was trying to sober up and I was. But my dad turned off my service (for other reasons) and I couldn't talk to her, or anyone. Ended up relapsing within a week of ""becoming sober"". That was over two months ago and I still haven't talked to her. Since then it got way worse, I started ordering dxm to my house and my dad caught me when I ordered over 10 grams of dxm, and gave me a super long talk about the ""addiction demon"" (which I have) but I didn't tell him bc I was to nervous.  Since it's summer break and I've had no service to text my normal guy I haven't had access to weed or lsd, but as soon as school starts back I will and I'm a little scared of how bad it gonna get Thank you for taking your time to read","I’m 17 and addicted to Oxycodone.

cpugdy,"I almost died of alcohol poisoning last weekend. I was in a party with some friends. In barely 2 hours I drank a whole bottle of gin by myself. Besides the alcohol I also consumed 2gr of weed and some ecstasy (unsure about the quantity.) I wasn't feeling bad or unwell but suddenly I started feeling weird. Not bad. Just weird. I decided to leave the party just in case I got worse. I didn't tell anyone, I just left.  While I was waiting for the bus to come I started to feel really bad. I couldn't even stand on my feet and everything seemed to spin around me. Then I passed out. Things get a little dark up from this point because I really don't remember much. I remember looking up to the sky. Throwing up. A crowd of people looking down on me. An ambulance coming. Me being carried to the hospital. More throwing up.  Here is where the lies begin. As I was being taken to the hospital I realised what was happening. I knew that they would call my parents if I told them I am underage so I hid my ID in my shoe. (I am 17, in my country the legal age of adulthood is 18.) Luckily I look older. When asked about it, I gave them a fake name, fake adress, fake details about myself...When asked if there was someone they could call I told them that all my friends were as drunk as I was (which was probably true),  that I was living alone and that no one could pick me up. I told them I had no money for a taxi and that I had to walk home. The medics injected me with some adrenaline, vitamines and other drugs and just let me go. No question asked.  When my friends asked about what happened to me, I told them I was just fucking with some girl I met.  I actually feel horrible about what I did and I needed to talk about it, even if it's just on some random internet page. EDIT:  There's lots of people in the comments saying how mixing drugs is the most stupid thing one can do. I know that. When I took all that shit I thought it wouldn't be so bad. I regret it now. I should have been more careful. Some people have asked why I drink so much. The truth is, I've had depression. I am much better now, some people even say I'm 'cured' but still, I drink because it helps me forget about myself. For a night, it's like I'm a different person and all the problems and bad things in my life dissapear. Still, I never drink more than a quarter or even half a bottle. Drinking the entire bottle is new to me. I'm still trying to figure out how I lost control of myself. I never lose control.  Anyway, before this I thought I wanted to die but I never wanted to live as much as I wanted to live when I was lying on a hospital bed struggling to keep breathing. I'm looking forward to talk about this experience with my therapist.  Finally, thanks to everyone for worrying about me and for supporting me and for giving me advice about how to handle this situation and about how  to improve myself. I really mean this, thank you very much for your love and support.","Weed is an anti-emetic, which basically means it stops you from vomiting.

d87cfu,"This is probably the pettiest thing I have ever done, and I regret it to this day. When I was fifteen years old, I got my first job and started to have some money of my own. I used my money to spoil myself and purchased nicer thing like clothes, shoes, makeup and salon brand shampoo. My brother used to sneak into my bathroom and constantly steal my nice shampoo. He would use them and most of the time he would leave them open in the bathtub. This would result in the rest of the shampoo going down the drain and leave me with empty containers. This drove me completely insane and I hated him for taking my things. I tried to speak with my parents about this, but they told me that I should just learn to share. One day I went out and purchased hair removal cream. I mixed this into my shampoo bottle and left it in my bathroom. I gave him a verbal warning not to use my newly purchased bottle, but he stole it again anyway. Over the next few days his hair slowly started to fall out and small bald patches started to appear. Seeing what I had done I immediately emptied the remaining shampoo. I felt terrible and I truly didn’t think it would have as a dramatic effect as it did. My mother took him to the doctor to get check out and they diagnosed him with Alopecia. He than had to start using this special and terrible smelling shampoo to combat this.   His hair did grow back but I just recently found out that he is still using the shampoo in order to prevent another Alopecia flair up. It has been 15 years now and I have never told my brother that I caused him to lose his hair. Edit: Some people are asking why I let this go on for 15 years. I honestly had no idea that he was still using the shampoo and just assumed he stopped at some point or that the doctor had told him he didn’t have alopecia.  I just helped him move over the weekend and found a fresh bottle of the shampoo in his bathroom. I completely forgot about this until now. Edit 2: He lived in the basement in the mother in law suite. So it did take a lot of effort for him to come in my second floor private bathroom to steal my shampoo and conditioner. Not trying to defend my poor decision but he didn’t just happen to use it by mistake. I didn’t just leave my things lying around.","LOL he has probably given other alopecia sufferers lots of false hope over the years, telling them how great that special shampoo worked for him.",6317
d8owmu,"A long time ago I was a high schooler at a boarding school. I was a decent kid in the eyes of the teachers and school administration. In fact they liked me so much that throughout my time there I was able to rise through the student ranks. I became a prefect, then I became the Head Boy, and at one point I had passed training that allowed me to run my own sports sessions or event where I was supervising younger and even a few older kids. This was just basic training for first aid, situational awareness, etc. At one point the school had so much trust in me that I was allowed to leave the school premises alone in the afternoons. This was huge and very few students had this privilege. In typical fashion, as soon as I received the privilege I began abusing my powers as a free man. The school was very adamant on getting us balanced meals so we weren't allowed to get food delivered (all delivery vehicles were refused entrance). Having the privilege of leaving the premises meant that I didn't have to order junk food and risk getting caught, I could simply go out to any fast food joint and bring food back with me.  It all started out as an exclusive club, myself and my friends were munching on McDonald's and KFC as the plebians were having the filthy healthy cafeteria foods. Then I was offered something I couldn't refuse, MONEY. Not long after I had built a whole operation for bootlegging junk food into the school. We had cut off times for orders, a priority list for regular customers, extra fees for late orders, and even a spreadsheet for keeping a record of orders, payments, and profits. This smuggling was next level, we were organised, knew all the fire exits, where to walk to avoid corridor cameras, and how to pack the food so that it's unnoticeable when walking in (mostly used sports bags with a thin layer of clothes). The teachers new something was going on, there was food wrappers everywhere but no one knew how it came in. Business was booming and I was making profits of 50 dollars a day, for 3-4 days a week. But it wasn't enough, I was hungry for more. There was a fat kid that ordered regularly, so I pulled the most asshole move you could do to your best customer. I started charging 2x the price for his orders and I would hide behind a bullshit moral barrier claiming we were doing this for his own good since we learned in economics that increased prices reduce demand and so he would be eating less and he would lose weight.

d93ycu,"Back in high school, I wasn't a great student and report cards always got me in a lot of trouble. Around the 9th grade I started intercepting the mail, scanning in my report card on my windows PC, then carefully changing all the grades and comments from my teachers using text & numbers that were already on the page. Afterward, I'd very carefully print it out so everything was in the correct spots, then folded it up and put it back in the envelope.  At one point in time, my mother was corresponding with one of my teachers via email to track my progress. I went as far as to make an email address that matched my teachers, just from a different domain and would delete the real emails from my teacher and forge fake emails that made me look better. Somehow, I never got caught","Wait, so you’ve graduated highschool. Did you go to college or get a job straight away? If you did go to college, wouldn’t they have to look at your report cards or did they just look at your entrance exam scores? Just curious.",2515
d9gchl,"So I've always been a good student, like high 90s. I was doing well in 11th grade physics, but got an 80 on a test which severely impacted my average. We weren't allowed to take tests home, so I snuck into the teacher's desk at lunch and grabbed mine, I scanned it and created a blank test using Photoshop. Then, I filled it out more or less properly and then matched the teacher's handwriting as best as I could and marked everything correct, but then wrote a wrong total on the front. I then asked to see the test the next day. I pointed out that there was an adding error. She apologized and corrected it, I then had a 98 ( can't be too good). This worked so well I did it on another 2 tests and even on the final before she entered the marks. Probably wouldn't do it again, but it did work. Edit: Wow, this blew up! So story is a bit embellished. It was only a drastic change on the first one, the later tests was a difference of 2 or 3 percent (95 to 97/98). The teacher kept tests in a filing cabinet where each student had a folder with their tests. I asked to see my tests and just put the folder back hoping she wouldn't notice a test was missing. I then asked to see it again when we had class after lunch and just put the test back into the folder and pointed out the mistake. In all seriousness, I probably deserved a mark like 2 percent lower, but oh well. I also don't condone this, some teachers might be more attentive in terms of their handwriting. I mostly was just curious if it would work, didn't really need the extra percentage. I also don't know how to use photoshop, I used paint.net.","Yoooo, my gr. 12 English teacher asked me about an analytic essay on Hamlet I never wrote a few weeks after because she didn't have a mark down for me. Teacher: I forgot to record your mark for that...do you remember what it was? Something like a 98? Me: ....yup.",1565
d9nlax,"I completely forgot about this until I saw another user's post on forging their way through physics. This was nearly twenty years ago. I had a doctor's note from when I had chicken pox the year before and, having a computer, scanner, and some knowledge of Photoshop, decided it was time to stop going to school so damn much! I shopped out all of the written details and dates, replaced the doctor's office number with my cell number, and printed out a stack of notes. When I felt like having a few days off, I'd fill in the pertinent information and fax it over. I'd pretend to drive to school, wait for my parents to go to work, and go right back home. Not once was it ever questioned. They never called to verify. I missed nearly 60 days my last year of high school.

Ok, no big deal. As I was standing to the side, a busload of kids walked in and went straight to the cashier, and she started taking their orders while another worker someone set my pizza on the counter and told to have a great day, so I assumed he thought I already paid. The cashier was completely focused on the busload of kids that came in, and wasn't paying any attention to me. I looked at the door which was wide open and then looked at her, and saw that she was completely focused on the long line of kids instead of me. Although I've never shoplifted in my life but I'd rather not wait 10 minutes for the line to finish, so I thought in my head ""Fuck it, I'm gonna do it"". And I fast walked out the door to my car with my pizza without paying. For the next few days I was scared they would a surveillance pic of me to the local news station or something and saying that there was a warrant for my arrest.

db35ff,"I had just started serving tables at a restaurant,  and I was working my first super busy brunch shift. I had 6+ tables and I’m not gonna lie, I had a tough time running all the mimosas that my tables were ordering. I could tell that one table of all women were getting abnormally angry about their drinks taking a while. I apologized for the delay and made a joke about it being an especially busy shift. I offered them a round of drinks on me to smooth the situation over. When I walked away, one lady murmured under her breath that I was an “incompetent cunt”.  Let’s stop there, its common for people to treat servers like shit, but this was the first time I ever had experienced being spoken to like I was garbage. I shook it off and continued to be nice to them, but it only got worse from there. They started to laugh at me, and shit talk me to one another. They told me that my future career looked pretty bleak, considering I couldn’t even serve tables, “honey, even a toddler can deliver drinks”. When I took their order for food, one woman REFUSED to speak to me. She just stared at me while her friend ordered for her. By now I am pissed. I asked her why she felt the need to have her friend order for her? She laughed in my face, looked down at the menu, and said because I was a dumb little bitch.  Due to the fact I was at work, I couldn’t argue or tell her to eat shit for treating me like I was a dog, if I did my boss would have fired me. They ended up stiffing me on their 200 dollar check. Once they left, I realized the woman that gave me so much shit had left her phone. I took it and went out the back door to smoke a cigarette and try to calm down, who the hell did that women think she is? So I promptly turned off her phone, threw it in the trash compactor, and turned it on. She came back minutes later and asked multiple staff members if we found it, I told her that I didn’t see it when I bussed the table, and that I would call her if it turned up. I never told anyone but I never regretted doing it. When you treat people like shit, expect shitty things to happen to you  Edit #1. Thanks for my first ever metal kind stranger!  Edit #2. I should have clarified that they stiffed me, as in they didn’t tip me.

I had insanely good grades in highschool too and I feel like this would be far to unexpected for my parents to believe without any further explanations.

dfzc8j,"When I was 15, I got myself pregnant unintentionally. I was a very promiscuous horny teenager and I wasn't exactly safe about it. Sometimes I used condoms, sometimes I didn't. I got really worried when I started experiencing the usual symptoms of morning headaches and nausea and skipped my period, so I took a pregnancy test and what I feared was true, I was pregnant.  I had no idea how to react to this. For one I was utterly terrified and I wanted to get rid of it. In a way it felt parasitic, the thing inside me with the power to fuck my life up. I have very Christian parents who would have disowned me for having an abortion, but I knew they would actually love to raise this kid. However, I hated the idea. I had problems with eating at the time and didn't want to gain the pregnancy weight and I just didn't want a child.  I guess I'm making excuses, even now. I started a smoking habit very promptly, since I'd heard in science lessons that one of the effects of smoking can be miscarriage. I barely ate at all, and if I did I threw it up, all in the hopes of starving it as if I was trying to get rid of a fever. It didn't work. I gave birth to her far too early and as a result she is blind. I gave her away and haven't heard from her since, she's 8 by now. My parents were surprisingly supportive and I got the help I needed for my eating disorder and I still go to regular therapy. I just had to get it off my chest.  Edit: I've realised now that this confession has come across as unremorseful. It was hard writing it, and as a result I focused more on what happened than my emotions. I want to make it clear that I really really regret my actions. It's very hard to live with what I've done, and when I was 17 I attempted suicide because I simply couldn't handle it any longer. What I've done to my child tears me apart every day. I still have nightmares, I still can't sleep at night. I can't tell you how many times I've wished and prayed to go back in time. However, I've focused on improving myself through therapy and I am training to be a nurse to help children. I know that doesn't make up for it, but I'm trying hard to be better.  Edit 2: This is NOT the way to deal with this situation. First of all, always always always use contraception unless you are willing to accept the responsibility of a child, which is a life long commitment. If you're a woman, don't trust the man to bring it each time and keep it in a safe, secure location. Bring your own condoms, get on the pill, get an implant, whatever works for you. If you do get pregnant, don't be afraid to reach out for help. Speak to your doctor or teacher you world. If you feel like you can't talk to your parents, but if you do think you can speak to them don't feel ashamed. Don't do what I did. Getting pregnant is not the end of the world.

dhcsig,"Just for info, I'm female. I absolutely hated my school. I was diagnosed with ADHD only a couple of years ago, at age 32. I daydreamed a lot, talked non stop, and my imagination was out of this world. That didn't work with institutions lol. I hated both schools, but primary school..ughhh. My attendance was poor, I'd fake being sick a lot.  The school was located in my neighborhood. We used to play on the fields and courts during closed hours. We were allowed to do that, just couldn't go around the back of the school. I had friends, but there were these times I'd like to hang out with myself. That's usualy when I did bad shit. That's how you don't get caught! I wouldn't purposely hang solo to do bad stuff though. Three incidents stick out in my mind: This one wasn't solo, but my act was. We wanted to play football/soccer in the dome, a little building in the back of the school property. I have no clue why? Just to see if we could? We got screwdrivers and took the doors apart. So while everyone was playing in the dome and running behind it, I had a better idea. I grabbed some rocks, and wanted to see if I could deflect them off the dome into the school's windows. I could. Smashed about 3 or 4 windows. Each sound of the glass breaking was sooo satisfying.  One day I decided to go to the football pitch with my golf driver club. We were poor kids, we'd find random things, so it's not like I had a set. Just one driver. I wanted to see how far I could hit the golf ball. The school was kinda far away and I wasn't aiming for it. I swung and hit the ball. Then I hear a smash in the distance. Any normal kid would've stopped and ran. Me? I wanted to see if I could recreate what I did. 2 more times. This was probably the most idgaf moment. I was walking around with my football/soccer ball. I decided to go over to the school. I went into ther back area around the trees. Genius me decides to kick the ball into the air for fun... around trees. The ball gets stuck. I attempted to climb the tree, but was unsuccessful. So, I see some big ass rocks. Figured I could knock it out if the tree. I stand looking AT the school, with the tree in between us. I start throwing rocks, and they're flying over the ball and into the windows. I smashed 7. This one was extremely satisfying, because the following day at school we had assembly. My headmaster was furious, asking if anyone knew about. I was gleeming on the inside.  Young me had so much anger inside because of my home life. So I took it out on the place I hated. My emotions were internalized, I was quiet. So the anger festered. Adults didn't know I was bad, because I wasn't disrespectful, and I never got caught. What I did was messed up, don't get me wrong. Just giving some context.","Thanks for sharing.

Back story on the drinking: I had be drinking between for about 20 years. I would drink from 6-10 beer almost every night of the week.  Then I was a junkie.  After about 1 months of doing heroin every few nights to help me sleep. I started doing it every night. Then after another month of that, I started doing it on my lunch breaks. I wanted to numb out everything that was going on with work and the lost of two very close people. I never hurt or stole or did anything harmful to anyone during my drug use. I went to work everyday in the pit of sadness and  a very harmful addiction. That was my life for two and a half years.  Then I lost my job:  Then I lost everything.  My life was heroin.  Once everything was gone I went to the doctor.  Still at this point I never stole or hurt anyone.  Getting sober was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.  Now I’m exactly one year sober.  I still have nothing but a dream.  I’m still not sleeping well. I still don’t drink. I’m about 160lb. I will never do herion again. Even if you put it in front of me. No matter what happens. I go to a shity job everyday that pays me nothing. All in hopes that one day I’ll be able to buy a van and live on the road. This is my last four years confession.",Thank you for all your comments.

dmkslx,"Pretty much just the title. 5 or 6 years ago my wife and I went to see a band we used to love. After 20 minutes or so of waiting for the merch guy to come man his booth, I had the bright (and very drunken) idea to pretend to man the booth myself. It really started as a funny gag just to make her laugh. Almost immediately people came up to buy stuff. I turned them all away, which made them very confused. However, my wife did pretend to be a customer and I ""sold"" her two shirts, which really we just stole. In my defense, I never took anyones money (I told them I was waiting to get the Square reader from the bands frontman) and we did originally intend to pay for the shirts, their merch guy just never showed up.

This has haunted me for months, thank you.","Honestly, as someone who has worked retail for years, I can't tell you how much the managers of that store don't care about *one* can of sloppy joe.

dtszsc,"This one makes me cringe a lot.  Probably 4 years ago when I was 16, I was at a car dealership with my parents. They were in the process of purchasing a new car, and of course the car dealer was doing all the sweet talking to keep us lured in and to make a purchase that day. Just in a friendly way to be more personable, my parents and the salesman had switched to talking about travel and kids and more personal stuff. In response to something my parents had said, the salesman replied with ""I would love to do something like that with my son. It's tough though, he is 22 but has the brain capacity of a 3 year old"". I immediately thought he was joking, and just roasting his kid. Like haha I have a stupid son. So of course I burst out laughing... It took about 2 seconds to realize I was the only one laughing and everyone was staring directly at me. I still remember the look the salesman had on is face. The look of I want to strangle you right now... But making the sale is more important. My stomach flipped realizing I laughed at his child's severe developmental issues. Woops. I just kept silent the rest of that conversation.  But hey, we drove off the lot in a new car that day.",The way he said it made it sound like a joke.

dv9iv5,"I read the other posts about people taking money out of the tills and thought I could do better than that. So no one knows this but I used to work for a bank (I assume no one is going to have sympathy for these guys) for several years. I won't say where or which one. Towards the end I was essentially redundant but they refused to pay me out and instead insisted on keeping me and proceeded to try to bully me into quitting. I have mental health problems and this began a mental breakdown for myself. I used all my sick leave and they refused further leave, I got the union involved but they are piss weak. Eventually got some leave entitlements plus a little extra with an agreement not to sue, \~$30,000. This was about $45,000 less than what my redundancy should've been at the time. Being mentally fragile I accepted as I didn't have the capacity or support to fight for my rights (I would have had a very strong legal case). So as you do when you're a bit down you have some erratic and destructive thinking. In the bank I worked in credit, fraud and collections among other things so I knew all the holes in the systems... A few phoney applications later I managed to get I estimate maybe $45,000 not including costs out of them. I won't say how because it was very specific to the organisation but had to get the money in actual products not cash so I then formed a business to turn the products into cash. I made a few mistakes along the way but I know financial crime is never investigated and I made sure that there was nothing linking the applications together so they wouldn't even know it was one person. Another plus was it made me very very happy doing this. Win win. I don't feel guilty in the slightest. I think I actually went pretty easy on them.

dxre3f,"I was about 10 and I was addicted to read encyclopedias. I could spend hours learning about all sorts of stuff, staring at the illustrations and photos, and of course, smelling the books. However, I could get my fix at my local library only as my parents could barely afford food for us, let alone buying fancy books. So, I became a regular guest at the kids/teenager section of the library. One day I couldn't get there in time, so I only had about half an hour to spend before closing time. Not just that, but they also had a brand new, 400 page encyclopedia waiting for me on the shelf. It was love on the first sight. I felt awful, because I knew that I couldn't do much reading in such a little time, and then there was this lovely smelling book with a montage of astronauts, cars and magnificent landscapes on the front cover just begging me to read it. Sadly, books like those were not borrowable and time was ticking. I thought about 'taking it', but it was just enormous and I wasn't. I wasn't a bad boy either, I told myself. But what if I just take a few pages? That surely won't hurt anyone, and noone will notice it missing. That's what I did. The book was binded in a way, that I could carefully rip about 5 pages out in one go. I wrapped the pages around my foot, slipped them in my socks, covered my socks with my pants and I just casually walked out. The first time I actually said 'Thank you very much' with a big smile to the librarian and she gave me that awkward 'What the heck are you talking about?' look. My 10 years old mind quickly realised how stupid I was to say that and I, maybe even my parents could be in jail for this, so I just rushed out, sweating and with my heart jumping out of my chest. Originally I wanted to return the pages at the next visit to the library. But as I was sitting on my bed at home, reading about the wildlife in Africa (the only content I got at the time), I came up with the masterplan of repeating the process until I get every page. And the plan was working! Not just that, but I improved on the technique. I wrapped pages around my feet, around my arms (had to wear long sleeve for that) and also kept a stack on my back, tucked carefully in my pants. I could get about 20-25 pages in just one day. I remember walking slowly like a robot on my way out as I didn't want to crush the pages too much. I couldn't bend in any direction because the pages were holding my limbs tight. After several visits to the library the encyclopedia began to visibly shrink. So I got some paper from the photocopy room and replaced the missing pages with blank ones. My last visit was the sketchiest, because I had to take the trophy somehow. By trophy I mean the hard cover with the astronauts on. There was no way to wrap it like I did with the pages and it was too big to hide it anywhere on me. But I was so close to victory, I couldn't let it go. I had the shiny cover in its full glory, in my hand. I put it under my t-shirt, on my back. Hands in my pocket, trying to hold the cover with my elbows. I was scared to the bone that they will catch me and send me to jail. I checked my reflection in the window. I looked like a terrified Lady Gaga with fake shoulderpads. But I was also shameless by this time, I knew I was an awful person. It was nearly 5 o'clock and every librarygoer left, the librarians were doing their closing up routines so the front desk was abandoned. I just walked out without anyone noticing me. I glued all the pages and the cover together at home. The book was nowhere near as majestic as before, but I loved it anyway. I have never ever stolen anything else in my life, and I am so sorry for this.",Later heists include stealing the Mona Lisa in a similar way yes?,1891
dyji1o,"At the age of 8, I decided I wanted to make money for whatever reason goes through the mind of a kid.  There was this mentally impaired kid living in my street, who was always very nice to the neighbourhood and waved her hand with a big smile to everyone. She could barely talk intelligibly but could understand simple words. So one day, going through the mess of my bedroom I found a plastic bottle cap. I walked up to the kid and told her it is a very important object and that her parents really need it. Her parents would be really happy to have it. They would be angry if she loses it.  Now, for mentally handicapped kids, their parents, their house, their neighbourhood is the only world they know. It is the limit of their universe, this is all they got. They are innocent. They cannot imagine what being mean or dishonest is.  I told her she needed to give me coins to get the cap. She came back with a bunch of coins in her hand. She looked so happy. She couldn’t count, so I took all of it.  It has been 20 years now, and I have deep remorses for what I did. Taking advantage of an impaired and innocent child who cannot imagine people can be deceiving. I can imagine her cheering that ridiculous cap, like its gold. Showing it to her parents because she loves them.  The kid has passed away because of her disease and I will never be able to repair what I did. I thought I would buy the cap back from her parents.

From the ages of like 11-15 I was OBSESSED with a game called Habbo and there was a game on Facebook called Miniplanet which pretty much had the same vibe. (For people who don't know what Habbo is it's a virtual reality world and you make rooms play games etc) I used to make pretty close friends on these games. I met a girl called Millie who was from my county, and ended up meeting her in real life. It was really cool. Well I became close with this girl called Rosie on this game. We would Skype all the time, text, spend hours and hours on this game together. Well one morning I woke up to a text from her 'Mum' claiming that Rosie had killed herself in the night. Me being 13 I believed it, you're gullible at that age. I tried calling her on everything gained no response. I didn't hear from her for about 2 weeks. However she was online Skype constantly so of course I was starting to come to my senses and kept calling and calling her. Well she accidently answered and GUESS WHOS SITTING THERE all shocked and pouty. It's Rosie. The look on her face was priceless. She immediately hung up the call and I immediately knew what to do. I was angry I guess??? Anyways she gave me her Facebook details so I logged onto this Miniplanet game and spent about £250 on the credit card that she had linked up to the account. Never heard a word. Became one of the richest on the game. Job done. ((I have more stories about people pretending to die on me but I'll leave that for another post.

e7n3q0,"This was almost ten years ago. I was a sales associate as a teen at a well known chain retail skate store. It was a cool job but my store manager sucked. Just rude and aggressive all the time, bullied the staff every day. I rocked it as a salesperson. I doubled my goals almost daily. Always at least met them.  One day, the store manager got our numbers for the quarter. We were a little behind where we should have been, but there were also two new associates who weren’t carrying their weight. Store manager blamed me for the numbers, and accused me of giving discounts to people and allowing others to shoplift. I had never done either of those things. I was livid. So, one night with a group of 4 friends or so, one of which used to work at the store with me, we came up with a plan to raid the place to give the store manager something to actually complain about. So, I went into my shift on a Sunday morning, knowing the assistant manager would be hungover. I convinced him to take a nap out back and that I wouldn’t tell if he let me claim the sales for the day. He didn’t care about anything so it was an easy yes. Cue my friends coming in, acting as customers with their “beach bags” as I’m working with regular customers on the floor alone. A “customer” (friend) would bring their “purchase” to the counter to “ring out” and have the security tags removed and then immediately go into the changing room and bag it. Bring it to their cars, wait 20 mins, do it all over again. We all had lists of items we wanted, and I had mine piled on the counter ready to be taken. In one hour we completed the list and my friends left. The assistant manager came back from his nap oblivious, I wrapped up my shift and went home. We divided up the clothing and celebrated. Never got caught. I put my notice in the next day, and that was that. Old friend from work told me when the next quarterly report came out (after I quit) the numbers were so bad from shrink (inventory of clothing missing with no money to show for it) the store manager got demoted.

e85vbw,"8 years ago when I smoked cigarettes one night I smoked one before bed. I flicked it and it landed in the corner of the side frame of the building. The wind was light so I figured it would have gone out. I went to bed and 2 hours later I get a loud bang on the door. I was sleep on the couch so it scared the hell out if me. I see the police light and I'm thinking I'm about to get busted for weed (another story for another time). So I open the door scared out of my mind and the officer says in a calm but happy tone, "" Do you know your house is on fire?"". I look to my left and the side frame is up in flames as well as the side of the apartment building. I wake up my roommate and his girl and we did the dash out of the apartment. And on to the side walk. A couple more friends  who lived in the next building over saw the smoke and rush over to see if we were fine. Anyway to sum this up, once the fire was out I saw how it was burned and sure enough it was where the cigarette bud fell. The fire department investigator asked me questions about if I smoked, when I last smoked, etc. I lied a bit otherwise it would have been a confession and at the time being 20 years old I had no idea if I would get in trouble or not.

We were really poor, but we still both would scrounge up change to buy a soda every now and then. With the recent ""healthy lifestyle"" thing schools were doing, all the soda vending machines were removed. For a while, we were really upset. However, I walked by teachers lounge one day while a teacher had the door open and saw that there was a coke vending machine still in there. Not only that, the price for a single bottle was only $0.50. That was an outright steal to us. We knew we had to get in there. The problem was that the door was constantly locked. We began creating our plan. During lunch hour, we scoped out the normal HS building. Since it was lunch, all students were required to be in the cafeteria. However, we knew a way to have access to the building was to get lunch detention. Kids in detention were released 20 minutes late for lunch. The easiest way to do that was to not turn in Biology worksheets. 3 Zeroes in biology and a few late lunches later, We found out that one of the teachers would leave a key in the door for easy access. On the fourth day, we put our plan into action. B would watch the door, as I slipped into the lounge after the teachers had gotten their lunch. I made my way to the machine with a dollar in quarters. On the way, I noticed a bowl in the corner labeled ""soda fund"" with lots of change and dollar bills inside. Greed took over me that day. We ran out of the school building with 3 sodas each.  We did this at least 4 more times throughout the rest of the semester.  We had to stop after the school installed security cameras. Eventually, the cheap soda machine was removed.

I unexpectedly graduated college early because I realized how much debt I was already in, realized I’d been working my ass off way harder than I needed to, and if I just pushed a little harder for my junior year, I’d have all the credits I needed for my degree.  Without that extra year of planning, I realized I had no idea what to do. During my last semester I applied for a seasonal job that provided housing across the country, and got it. Two weeks after graduation, I left. My boyfriend had applied to the same company and didn’t get hired, so I left him behind and we became long distance.  The job was a blast. I was literally living inside of a national park. I made great friends. But not having my partner of the last 3 years by my side was tough, and one of my roommates was actually insane.

I kept dreaming I woke up to my other roommate stabbed in her bed. The crazy roommate was also a filthy hoarder, so we were living in actual filth. It was nauseating to be in the same room as her, and I was terrified to even try to touch her stuff to clean it up. For weeks, I had my things packed in case I had to run out. I spent two whole paychecks on a car off Craigslist because I didn’t have one and I felt vulnerable without an escape plan (no cell service, only one mountain phone in the office).  One day we get home from work and I ask my manager to speak to her in her office. My plan was to explain the situation and ask if there was any room for me and my good roommate in another apartment. But what really happened was I started sobbing. Like, ugly, can barely breathe sobbing.  It just slipped out. I said my dad had a heart attack and I needed to go home. In that moment I realized if I broke my contract, I wouldn’t get the sizeable bonus we were promised if we stayed. I said I didn’t want to leave them hanging and I was really worried about money since my dad couldn’t work. She said that family came first and she’d see if I could still get my bonus.  All my stuff was already basically packed so within 15 minutes of that conversation I was on the road.  I didn’t even go to my parents. I drove 24 hours to my boyfriend’s (a completely different state than my parents). The shitty car was a trooper and didn’t break down until about a week after I got there. I didn’t even say goodbye to the friends I made there.  Not only did I get my bonus about a week later, I was able to call them for the next season and get my boyfriend and myself jobs as managers, and we worked there for two years. My crazy roommate tried to come back but wasn’t hired, thank god she was also a shitty employee.  I’m still not sure why I didn’t just tell the truth that day, and honestly feel guilty for it.",Personal and mental health is important. Don’t worry about it too much. Shit happens lol.,705
egbldz,"Basically, she dropped the 100 dollar bill in one of the isles of this game store. I picked it up and I remember wanting to give it back, but I was there to get Yu-GI-Oh cards (I had recently lost all my good cards to my friend in a bet) so this was a miracle of sorts to make a solid come-back. So I kept it, I thought the woman had left the store so I went to go purchase my cards, right as I gave my money to the cashier, she walks up behind me watching me buy my 100 dollars worth of Yu-GI-Oh cards (this isn't a normal thing to do). She said nothing though and I left before she went to go buy her items so I didn't have to see the look on her face when she realized. There is no doubt in my mind that once she realized she was 100 dollars short, she would make the assumption it was the kid in front of her in line who spent 100 on cards. I just want to say, I am a different person now :)","I once found 10 dollars on the floor in GameStop, I left it there as I assume it was someone’s else’s and I didn’t want to steal. When I went to pay for my game I noticed I was 10 dollars short. I connected the dots and those 10 dollars on the floor where mine to begin with. I went back and they were gone. I had to go back to my dad and tell him I lost part of the money he gave me. he screamed and shit but went and bought the game for me.",2478
ehuvnm,"When I was 16 I worked in a restaurant. (For those unaware, in the US it is illegal to serve alcohol until you are at least 18 years old). We had a couple that came in on a regular basis that were pretty rude and just generally annoying to deal with. Had a complicated order, thought the world revolved around them, the works. The woman often ordered beer and one day when she came in, I just wanted to make her go back to her table and stop talking to me so without thinking I grabbed the bottle she ordered and passed it over the counter to her.  It was a somewhat busy day so I was quickly onto the next customer, and the next, and so on. So I soon forgot about the incident, didn't think to let anyone know it had happened. A few weeks later, someone from the liquor authority showed up saying there had been a complaint about a minor serving alcohol. I denied having done it and the manager that was there believed me and assured the man that that most definitely never happened.  This was several years ago now and I haven't mentioned it to anyone since. EDIT: I am FULLY aware that this isn't super dramatic, but it is completely true.",I really hope you don’t lose any sleep over this lmao. I did this every night in HS when I worked at an Outback. I’m surprised someone actually cared enough to complain.,2948
eix7vq,"Few years ago, I was a manager / tech for an arcade that used a card-based points system for games. The job was pretty ideal I thought - I liked fixing stuff, but I hated customers. BOY, DID I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH INTERACTION WITH CUSTOMERS I WAS IN FOR. By nature of the job, I ended up being the easiest manager to find as I was always on the floor fixing something and thus I dealt with probably 90% of the customer complaints. It got old quick. Having to stop what I was doing, cleaning up my area so that I could walk away and assist a customer and then go back to what I was doing made completing anything longer then it should. With a new plan in my mind, I started every morning loading up a bunch of cards with free points - As I was a manager, I was allowed to comp - More on this later. THE PLAN FUCKING WORKED GREAT - Customer complaining about the arcade game not giving them 5 tickets - you know what, here's a card with a shit ton of points on it, I'll take a look at that machine when I'm done. I'd give out probably $500+ a week in video game comps. The kicker here is that other managers knew what I was doing but couldn't explain it. They would run a report that lists comps and I would always be at zero. You see, the Point of Sales system would track comps - however, they were too dumb to notice the replacement card option which were not technically comps. The shit ton of free candy I ate was a nice perk too.",I hate people. Its one thing to complain but people are such dicks while doing it. If I have to complain about something I still try yo be courteous to the person Im asking. Some people need to be wacked with a bat.,729
ejhaak,"...and I mean a lot.  My dad was/is a pretty addicted chain smoker and he really doesn't want to admit it. So naturally he buys a lot of cigarettes. He also doesn't lock them away or something and has them lying around the house or just his smoking spot (which is outside).  Me, a few years ago, being this desperate teenager who wanted to be cool and couldn't afford cigarettes himself stole from him pretty regularly. I can't really recall how much it was, but it was a good amount.  He found out after a few months, because I always stole just a few cigarettes so he wouldn't notice and this one time I got greedy and stole a package, which as I said he noticed.  Looking back at it,it was a really shitty move and it surely contributed to the nicotine addiction that I'm struggling with now. Karma I guess.","I think most teenager smokers have done this. My nan was a secret(not so secret very badly hidden, who waters the plants at 10pm?!)smoker and we found her stash and would pinch one or two when we were round because we were skint then use our pocket money to randomly put a 10box back when we could. When we were adults and my grandad passed she would smoke and we admitted to it she said she couldn't understand what was going on and thought it was my grandad just helping her lol.

ekxaxm,"I have been getting up late for months now. To be honest I used to really enjoy getting up early and starting my work early before sunrise, but I was sleep deprived. I have a 45 minute commute and was terrified everyday because it was hard to stay awake while I was driving. I work in agriculture.  When I first started coming in late it was just by 30 minutes or so, because I had just started taking care of livestock on my own property and I was still getting used to it. I explained that to my boss and she was always kind and understanding. She's the best boss I've ever had and really cares about me, she never questions my being late and only asked me to tell her that I'm going to be late, because she wants to know I'm okay. However, once I started coming in late, it was like a switch went off in my brain. I was pretty sleep-deprived and started just sleeping in and saying I was taking care of the animals. Eventually my normal work time shifted by about three hours and I was staying up late at night. I did eventually start going to sleep early again, but it didn't make a difference. My brain simply will not let me wake up earlier. It's gotten worse and I've even been neglecting my morning duties to my animals just so I can sleep an extra 30 minutes. I've tried every alarm app and it doesn't matter. I am so tired in the morning, I will simply snooze as many times as I can and eventually turn the alarm off, before going right back to bed. I have 0 will power. I'm sleeping like 12 hours a night and it's still a problem. I've had depression in the pass and that's probably part of the problem but not all of it. I'm so ashamed, but my boss just assumes that I'm late because of my animals and I pretend she's right. Just today when I told her I would be late told me that she's glad I'm okay, and she understands because ""I understand life with livestock! Don't worry!"" God I feel terrible, she's such a kind person and deserves better. The animals deserve better.  Edit: Jesus, I wasn't expecting a single upvote. I really appreciate the advice everyone is giving me. I'll try to respond to everyone. I also want to note that none of my responses are intended to be excuses, just context. I know I am responsible for my actions/inactions. If I notice myself repeating the same answers I might edit again.  Edit: to address a few responses: 1) I'm not paid by the hour, thus my boss is not loosing money 2) when I say I'm neglecting the animals: they aren't suffering, I've mostly just been cleaning the manure at night instead of in the morning, which they don't care about since they're outside. 3) I haven't been to a doctor in a few years, but I've had these issues before and had a sleep study and blood test. No sleep apnea, and I'm very slightly low on something, can't remember what but it wasn't iron or B12. I take B12 supplements, too. 4) As I said, I've tried every alarm app. I use Alarmy with the picture option set to my fridge, and on the loudest alarm sounds. It works sometimes. Other times I turn the phone off. Alarmy has an option to disable power-off, but there are still ways to turn it off. I have tried so many ways to stop myself but every morning I do it again. It's like I'm a different person in the morning who doesn't give a crap about anything but sleeping. 5) about my 12 hours of sleep every night: Yes, I know this is a problem. I know this is not normal. I know sleeping an extra 30 minutes isn't helping me. That's kind of the point. I am trying to change my behavior, but I made this post because I need to hold myself responsible. Maybe this will drill the consequences into my brain and help me in the morning, I don't know. 6) yes I'm an irresponsible POS and need to do something about it.","I had this problem as well. I started therapy and my therapist explained it well to me. The difference between Guilt and Shame. Say I go to the supermarket and I steal a Snickers bar. Guilt makes me feel really bad, so bad that I go back to the store, return the Snickers and apologize for stealing. I face whatever consequences there are because it is the only way to clear my conscience. Shame tells me “I am just a thief, that’s what I am and will always be. So I am just going to feel this pit in my stomach but keep the Snickers and probably steal another someday.” I realized I had shame for being late to work daily. I just thought “I can’t wake up early, this is who I am. I’ve tried before.” But when I realized I felt shame for this problem I had, it’s like a switch happened in my brain. I told my therapist I would do better (I just needed some kind of accountability!) She encouraged me to reward myself after 3 days of being on time to work (I got a latte at my favorite craft coffee shop! And I was early enough to work that day to get it on my way in and still be on time. Something I never thought I would be able to accomplish after months of being late). Being late to work started for me after a depressive episode and toxic work environment. Getting up earlier helped me also realize that I had control over my situation, my life, my habits. Since then I have been able to get a new job after applying to them all year long. I definitely attribute my change in attitude toward getting up early as part of that! It’s still hard some days, but reward yourself for doing well and don’t let yourself feel shame for something you can definitely fix.",3475

He had this blue Nintendo Game Boy that I had been eyeing for a while, and I decided to propose a trade. I told him that I actually knew Benji and Joel Madden (lead singers of the band) and that I had their autographs. I told him I'd trade him the autographs for his Game Boy and he enthusiastically agreed.  I went home and spent a good 20-30 mins with my next door neighbor forging their signatures. After we agreed on one we used her parents lamination machine to make it really legit. The next day he handed over his Game Boy in return for the fake autographs.

en31v9,"I live in australia. Not sure how it works in the rest of the world but i was on my provisional drivers license as a teenager (we call them P-plates) and when you are on that you cannot have ANY alcohol in your blood whatsoever. I stayed at my mates place one night and he had some beers to drink. I had two knowing i had to drive the next day and was gonna stop but he convinced me to have another so i did.  The next day i got in my car to drive home and as I was turning a corner there were a couple police doing an RBT (random breath test) and i panicked. I knew full well id have a little bit of alcohol in me and thats enough to lose my license  for a couple months. I had just left school and gotten a really good job and if i got a drink driving charge i would have to rely on my parents to drive me there which wouldn’t work out as they both have jobs. I panicked and turned right onto another street. I drove halfway down the road thinking i had gotten away with it but one of the cars suddenly turned round the corner and blasted the sirens. I pulled over and the cop came to my window. Cop: can you explain to me why you just avoided an RBT? Instead of explaining to the cop why and just taking my punishment I decided to lie.  Me: I wasn’t trying to avoid it, i live down here Cop: where abouts do you live? Me: just over there Cop: well you don’t mind if i follow you and watch you enter your house for proof do you? Kinda shit myself but agreed. He got in his car and i drove into a driveway halfway down the street and walked up to the door. My current plan was to just explain to whoever is at the door whats going on and hope he lets me inside. I walked up and knocked but no one answered. Then i looked over my shoulder at the cop and turned to just open the door and it was unlocked. I walked inside and shut the door. I was really scared for if whoever lived there was gonna walk out and see me and scream but no one did. I stayed at the door peeking out the window at the cop and he left after about 10 minutes. I waited another 10 minutes before walking down and driving off again with a big sigh of relief. Not here to condone drink driving or anything. I made a mistake and it was wrong. Just sharing this story EDIT:  PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING just to answer some questions that are being asked frequently; Why didn’t the cop check my License?  I don’t know he just didn’t. He asked why i was avoiding him and then followed me to make sure i was telling the truth. Same answer for why he didn’t scan my plates Why did you knock on the door? Again I don’t know. I didn’t want to just enter a strangers house. Three beers would have been out of my system? Maybe. Depends on the percentage of the beer itself and what time i had my last one. I didn’t specify either and it was 6 or 7 years ago so i cant really tell you. I know that i could still taste it on my breath when i left that morning",The amount of luck here is staggering.,5574

He has not had any good sleep for half a year back then. ) He still went to work and all but he was kind of distracted all the time. So fucked up teenager me would grab his wallet and pull out 10$ ,1$ bills, just small amounts that he never noticed. I don’t know why i didn’t ask him he would have given it to me. Worst part is he died shortly after and i was never able to tell him about it/ confess it to him. It kind of makes me feel extremely awful to this day. I feel so bad about this... Edit: Thanks to all of you i can not even tell you how much you helped me out with my bad feelings. I remembered now that one reason i did not want to ask him was that i kind of disconnected from him because of his countless diseases he had at the time. I just could not cope with his suffering and i was just caught up in stupid teenager world, trying to impress other people etc. I know now that even though he died so soon in my life he was being the best dad he ever could not ever letting me down.

erc2dd,"My father is a dick and so my uncle (my mother's brother) has always been one of my favorite male figures He's about 13 years older than me, so I saw him as a really cool older brother. He took me to school, played with me, helped me with my homework, went to the pool with me and everything else a little girl could want. But when he was in the middle of the 20's and I was 12-13 he started to give me less and less attention, got a girlfriend, was starting to think about having children and I became really jealous. I always spent a lot of time alone with him and started making small threats whenever he didn't give me any attention when he was ""babysitting"" me. I started by saying that if he didn't drop the phone to talk with me or anyother thing I woulf tell my mom that rubbed my butt or something ""minor"" as it. He seemed very uncomfortable to hear that and most of the time he paid attention to me. It didn't take long for me to realize that this works very well and I started using it more and more, making more and more serious threats, including that he had touched my privacy in the pool or made me play ""doctor"" with him or ask for pictures. In my head I ""knew"" it was wrong, but I didn't understand the seriousness of what I could end up telling my mom, so I really don't know how much he just accepted it or really felt threatened. Anyway, it continued until I was about 14, almost 15. I'm 17 now, he turned 30, got a good job, moved to another city and is really living a good life. But since then he has acted like I don't exist, we never spoken proper again, he never appeared on my birthdays or of any other family ""child"" where I could be and I think he really hates me. I wish I could tell him that I'm sorry and that I love him very much, and that I was jealous and didn't want to lose the only person in the family who took me to do cool things. But I also feel like a piece of shit that would never be able to see him in the eye to talk about it. I don't even know if he would be willing to forgive me, but he is afraid of approaching me thinking that I can do the same again; or he just doesn't want to know about my existence anymore. I really wanted to know what to do. How to apologize. I'm afraid of everything he can say to me if we're going to talk about it. I think it will hurt even more than the silence. &#x200B; Edit to add: people suggesting sending a letter (paper and pen) I have no idea of his address. I can find his work email (he is self-employed, not a corporate email) and send it to him. &#x200B; Edit to add 2: I wrote the email and sent it. I said everything I felt, I said that I looked for help here and asked him to give any sign so that I could at least know that he read the email. If he answers me I will update. If he doesn't answer me I'll be on reddit to see if he posts something here. &#x200B; Update post  [https://www.reddit.com/user/Girlneedtoconfess/comments/ess3to/update/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Girlneedtoconfess/comments/ess3to/update/)","Put your apology in writing.

erx6g9,"I never had a good relationship with my mom.  That isn't to say I don't love her, and we have repaired a lot of damage but she was *not* a good mother. For as long as I can remember, I've had a problem with lying.  For many years, it's been second nature to me - a way to get out of trouble, to get sympathy or admiration from others.  When I was 20, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder & was told that lying was a symptom of impulsivity and fear of abandonment.  A few years back, I was in a 5-year-long relationship during which I was systematically and routinely cheated on, smacked around and emotionally abused.  Through fear of being alone, and to stop him from leaving me, I told my ex-partner that my mother had died.  To keep up the lie, I told two of my closest friends from college (who are also acquaintances & don't live near me).  I acted the whole part; crying down the phone.  I made up a cause, a funeral, everything.  I hated myself, but I was too cowardly to take it back, afraid that everyone would hate me and that I would lose the people I loved.  In an anxiety-driven attempt to salvage the mess, I made things worse by telling one of my friends that my mom was actually alive but that *she* had faked it.  2 years ago I met my husband - who knows everything.  My life changed almost instantly, and in that time I have learned so much about myself.  My mental health has improved drastically and, although I'll likely never be free of this sickness, I have learned new ways to cope and to control myself.  I can say wholeheartedly that I don't tell lies anymore.  However, with growth has come an overwhelming sense of guilt.  I now understand the full gravity of the lie I told, it haunts me every single day.  For the past few months I have been avoiding the friends I lied to.  One of them I genuinely do want to cut out (she's a very toxic person who I recognise is a bad influence on my mental health) but I fear her vindictiveness will reach the people I love who never knew what I did.  I have stuck around as much as possible to avoid her turning her spitefulness towards me. She is not a woman who takes being lied to lightly.  The other, who I adore, I have neglected entirely because I feel I can't face her.  I miss our friendship, but I'm afraid she will hate me for what I said.  It won't be long until they both start to question me about why I have been avoiding them. I want them both to know the truth, but I desperately fear the consequences.  It breaks my heart to think of my parents finding out through one of them.  My toxic friend is one of those Facebook detectives.  I am afraid to pursue my dream of being a writer, to use my name.  I live completely anonymously, with no friends and when my husband is away for work I am desperately lonely.  The lie I told weighs on me, I wish I had never said it.  I don't know how to break this daily cycle of guilt without confessing the truth, but I don't want to open up a can of worms either & have it impact me, or any of my family, in the future.","I have not told my friends or girlfriends that my mom is dead because I was not as ashamed as am I now of her for what she did to my family. People say I'm petty but I cannot stand that she left my father to marry her first cousin. I was 21 when she married him and 18 when she left my father. I was on meds for ten years bc of anxiety and well it was based on how volatile my parents relationship ended up being. Then when she broke the news of her marrying her cousin I was ""doped"" up so it didn't really bother me till about 2 years ago when the meds stopped helping because my problem was my mother. I got off the meds and now clearly see that it was her all along. She will not allow me to tell my niece and nephew that their ""grandpa"" is really their great uncle. It sickens me to see the confusion when I bring up my dad and they don't call him grandpa. When I decided to get off the meds I made up my mind that she would not be allowed in the life if I ever settle down and have kids. She thinks it is an empty promise but is now starting to see that I am serious. I sometimes feel regret because she has helped me out but at the cost of my sanity and my high school sweetheart leaving me, but I do not anymore.

evvivb,I stole a $10 bill from the girl sitting next to me in like 5th grade. I seen her put it in her desk and I plotted on stealing it that very moment. It was picture day so I was sure that’s what it was for but I didn’t care at the time. I told myself I would do it when she goes to the bathroom but she never did. So I did it when she was in the middle of a conversation with her friend sitting on the other side of her desk. I was scared as hell but I eventually reached my hand in there and it felt like forever but I got it and I instantly felt rich.

f3csd5,"Back in elementary and middle school, the scholastic book fair was every kids favorite time of the year. My parents were frugal, so I was never able to secure 10-15 dollars to pay for anything there. I went to elementary and middle school in fairly affluent neighborhoods so seeing other kids get stuff from the fair hurt and I really wanted to get my own stuff. I thought of a genius idea which I used for years. so, as a class and during lunch when we would visit the school library, I thought of the idea of putting the books and items I wanted into the bookshelf. Kids would crowd the library, so in the midst of the chaos, while the librarians and teaches were occupied, and the students fascinated with all the items available for the event, I placed whatever I wanted into the bookshelf.  I would later return after the event had finished to reap my rewards.  I'm already 23 so this was well over 12 years ago already. I still have so many Guinness world record books, captain underpants, and diary of a wimpy kid book, some of the books I stole that are floating around the house.

f8xhb9,"This happened when I was a 5-year old. My uncle was visiting us, sitting and talking to my dad in living room. I was playing around with different toys and then remembered the bb pistol my older brother had recently bought. I'd seen him arming it by pushing the front loading piston inside the barrel. My brother was outside at the time so I went into his room and found the bb gun. Took it and immediately found it real heavy. I couldn't arm it with my tiny hands so I put the piston on the ground and sat on the handle to arm it up. Came back to the room and went to my uncle side. He was still talking and didn't notice what I was about to pull. His head had blocked me so even my dad didn't see it when I raised the bb pistol up and shot the poor bastard in his ear from just an inch away. He went down screaming and holding his ear. Ran away and hid in a kitchen cabinet. There was lots of noise and after several minutes I heard people calling my name. Obviously I didn't dare to come out of hiding. Finally when I heard the family was going outside the house looking for me opened up the cabinet door and my sister noticed me. Thanks heavens the gun wasn't loaded with pellet but my uncle's outer ear was bleeding from the metal piston impact. They gave me some serious lessons but to this day I don't understand why I did that crazy thing. My uncle was generally very nice to me.

A few months into the year and I’m sitting in Math class and this one girl who I just could not stand (and who also bullied me on and off) kept just interrupting for the stupidest of things, and just generally kept getting on my nerves the whole lesson. Part way through the lesson the teacher tells us to leave our things in the classroom so we could go to the computer lab, and I was the last to leave the classroom. Note that most kids hid their iPods under their pencil cases during class so they could get away with using it, and I knew for a fact she’d left it there.  I don’t know what possessed me to steal her iPod, but I did. She never found out.  But now, I leave school, the iPod is still in my shorts pocket. Nobody knows what I’ve done. The girl thinks one of the guys was screwing with her and doesn’t suspect me at all.  Now the one defining feature of her iPod was that the back was completely covered in small circle stickers. Ones that had gotten so worn down they’d almost fused with the device. So I did what I could and I scrubbed those fuckers off until it looked brand new.  I didn’t use it at all, in fear of my mum seeing it and screaming at me for being a thief. So it just sat in my room gathering dust, until about a month later I overhear her asking some people if they know anyone selling an iPod.

This is not written on an alt or a throwaway, because I am aware that what I did was bad and I still do regret it to this day, but shit happens, especially when you're a dumb kid, and you guys are not the first ones I have told this story to. Anyway, I had this buddy (we'll call him M). Me and M used to hang out alot and on this particular day we were at his house just shooting the shit, when we got the sudden urge to make a few bucks. We then started brainstorming ideas. I came up with the idea that we should walk around to peoples houses and ask for money for ""charity"", specifically, poor kids in Africa. (I know, horrible as fuck) So, we start off by walking around his local block, just asking a bunch of neighbours and what not. There we managed to scrape together about 20 bucks, and we were thirsty for more. So we started walking more around town and eventually we'd managed to scrape together a whopping 100 bucks. Our usual routine would be mostly about guilt tripping the people into donating small amounts and it worked because we were two ""innocent"" looking kids who just wanted to help.Now, I didn't get away with it. Here is the very ironic mistake that caught us. We'd decided to hit the final apartment block of the day and we walk inside and start ringing doorbells. No one but one guy answered and what I didn't know, was that he was a close friend of my foster parents church group and he recognized me but I didn't recognize him. We do our usual routine and managed to get a decent amount off of him. We then decided to go to a diner and get some burgers and fries for the ""hard earned"" money. A few days later I was confronted about what I had done, apparently he had told my foster parents that he thought ""It was so good that I was out collecting money for charity"" and they of course had no idea what he was talking about. Ever since that day, I have always donated to charities out of guilt for what I did back then. Funny thing is, M went on to rob a gas station with his buddy a few years later, and ever since that day I have not heard from him. Life is peculiar.    TL;DR: Used to walk around with buddy and pretend to raise money for charities, got caught by a family friend because he told my foster parents.","This is a good confession.

After arguing for a good 20 minutes, we were all panicked and exhausted and didn't know what to do. We ended up calling probably 10 other hotels and motels in the area, explaining our situation. One of the hotels told us they had a room available, and even gave it to us for the price we were supposed to pay at our original stay. It was family owned, not in a chain. The owner was so incredibly kind, making sure we were okay and checked up on us often and even had a security guard walk us to our room since the rooms lead outside.

The day before we left for the festival, however, I dyed my hair really bright blue and hadn't washed my hair yet. When I got out of the shower, I accidentally dyed two of the towels blue. I felt bad about leaving them and ultimately risking them just getting thrown away, so I packed them in my suitcase. I never got charged a fee for the towels and I still have them to this day. I feel guilty about it even though it probably doesn't seem like a huge deal.  TLDR: Just as the title says, I stole a couple towels after accidentally dying them blue from my hair. edit: Decided I am going to donate the towels to my local animal shelter. They are no longer blue. :-) edit 2: After a few hours of searching, I finally found the motel! I left a 5-star review and will see if I can donate after this pandemic is over. Also, I just wanted to say that I hope everyone is staying well and safe and I'm seriously wishing everyone well during this time.",U can still make it right,551
gqzdka,"When I was in the third grade, I was very into reading/writing and often stayed up far past my bedtime reading anything within my comprehension level that I could get my hands on. We had a stack of children’s encyclopedias I loved on all sorts of topics (dinosaurs, the planets, world history, etc) including one of stories/poems. One poem stood out in particular, it was about solitude in nature and really struck a chord with me. Because I loved the poem so much, I copied it down into a journal I had of my own writing and passages/poems I found inspiration in. Because I was so young (talking single digits here) it never occurred to me to write down the author or anything, especially not in my own journal. A few weeks went by and my mom had stumbled upon journal while cleaning my room. She read the poem and assumed it was original writing. She approached me about it that night and was so proud of it. Like any 8 year old, I wanted my mom’s approval and pride, so I didn’t tell her I had actually found the poem in a book. I didn’t think it would be a big deal, and she was so proud.  Fast forward a month or two, my mom is reading the Sunday paper and sees a poetry contest for young people. She immediately thinks of “my” poem and insists I enter it. That afternoon, she had my dad drive us to his office so she could type it up (before home computers.) She sends a copy into the newspaper and, of course, because it’s an 8 year old’s name on an adult’s published poem, it wins the first prize in my age group. My parents are so happy with me and I feel so incredibly guilty.  Within the next month, the poem and my picture are ran on the front page of the arts section in the paper. I am invited to read the poem as part of an award ceremony for all the contest’s participants. Of course, I go because my mom wants us to, and why wouldn’t I? I get a small award, a ribbon and maybe a gift card? I don’t remember. What I do remember is feeling so incredibly guilty. I have spent more sleepless hours over this poem than I can count. A few years later, we learn about plagiarism in school and I feel as though I’m being personally called out. I remember tearing out the book’s page with the poem, ripping it up, and throwing it away wrapped in an unused sanitary napkin because I was so afraid anyone would find out. It’s been 20 years since that award ceremony and even though I realize it was a childhood mistake that isn’t even that large, I still can’t quite shake the guilt.  TL;DR - When I was 8, my mom read a poem in my journal and assumed it was original writing. I didn’t correct her, and eventually she entered it into a poetry contest. It won’t first place and I’ve been guilty for the past 20 years. Edit: Whoa! Thanks guys - you’ve honestly made me feel a little better. So many have requested the poem so I’ve posted it below. Couldn’t figure out line breaks so I’ve used slashes.  This Is My Rock by David McCord This is my rock /  And here I run / To steal the secret of the sun; This is my rock / And here come I / Before the night has swept the sky; This is my rock, / This is the place / I meet the evening face to face",Love this !  Similar situation when I was little. I was learning to draw a horse from a step by step book at school and got frustrated and just traced the horse and colored it in.  My mom saw it when she picked me up from school and asked if I drew that and I said yes bc she seemed surprised. She asked me a few more times and I kept saying yes.  We spent the weekend at my grandmas house and my mom told me to show my grandma my “art”. Grandma loved it so much she FRAMED IT and it hung over the bed I slept in when visiting until she DIED.  Maybe like 15 years later I told my mom I actually traced the horse and have been feeling so guilty and she said “I KNOW”. !!!!!!!!!!,2631
gt3ir2,"When I was in second grade I tried way too hard to be cool. I’d do everything teenagers back then would do, I pretended to be an anime character, I told stupid and impossible-to-believe stories to my innocent second grade classmates and I always felt good when they believed me. I managed to make 2 “friends” through talking about Minecraft. This was in 2011-2012, I’m currently 16. I was basically the third wheel in this friendship since I was new to the school and these two were best friends since kindergarten. We would always trash talk our classmates behind their backs but we never said anything bad to them in their face. Except this one guy. His name was Arian and he was always the lonely kid, being friendly to everyone and trying his hardest to make a friend. He was fat but he wasn’t obese, just a little chubby around the torso and the cheeks, but damn did Arian’s qualities make me and my friends feel way more superior than we should’ve. We started to mess around with him during recess, and by mess around I don’t mean the good type of messing around, I mean the harassing type. We always tried to find him during recess when we had nothing to do. Once we found him we would follow him (as I said he was a lonely kid and would walk around school alone) and talk bad about him just loud enough so that he could hear us. I specifically remember one of my friends saying “yeah you’re never going to make a friend, nobody likes you, fucking fat idiot”. I saw him sit down on a rock (our school had a big backyard and there were big rocks in one of the corners that we could sit on) and just looked down. I felt so fucking bad, he was just sitting there with the biggest fucking frown I’ve ever seen in my life. I think he was on the verge of crying.  I told my friends that that was enough and that we should leave him alone, because I just couldn’t handle seeing him sitting down like that, feeling like we just destroyed his social life. I don’t really remember much after that day, it’s been around 8-9 years since we did that to him. But I remember when we started third grade, we were all separated and I was sad that I didn’t get put with my friends. On around the third week of school our principal came in with Arian and notified us that he’s going to be in my class now. I don’t really know why, I think he was already in my class from the beginning but he just came to school really late and being a third grader, the principal probably wanted to show him where his class was so he wouldn’t get lost. Right when I saw him, I remembered the moment where he sat on their rock and I just crumbled inside. I still felt so bad about what I did to him. Once our teacher finished explaining the class and we had to do an activity or something he stood up and came to me and said hi. I immediately said that I’m sorry, but nothing else. He said he forgives me but I just don’t forgive myself with that trash, half-asses apology. 2 or 3 weeks later my mom told me we were going to go back to our old country, and so I left. No notice, no goodbye to my classmates, no goodbye to my friends, nothing. If you’re reading this, Arian, I’m so fucking sorry for saying all that mean shit to you. My second grade brain and ego got the better of me and I just wanted to fit in. Seems like I tried to fit in in the wrong group. I hope the other two started to treat you better after I left.",Everyone does shitty stuff as a kid. At least you apologised. Maybe you could find him on social media and see how hes doing?,369
gtktzr,"In 4th grade my friends were talking at the table and my teacher called ME out for it. He sent me to the timeout chair in the back and i was infuriated. Of course he would blame the black kid. Lol seriously though, i was pissed off and grabbed one of those grey push pins with the round back, and placed it on the chair. I went to the bathroom after putting it down not really thinking about what ive done. While walking back to the classroom in the hallways i hear a “AHHHUUGGGH” coming from my classroom. Almost sounded like Arnold Shwartzeneggar moaning. I walk in to see him rubbing his ass and giving this long speech about how disrespectful the class has become. His face was red and he left the room. I asked my friends and i guess he sat on it while moving to the back of the class to talk to a student. Mr. H, if you see this, i am so so sorry.","You did what you had to do and don't feel sorry, he sounded like a racist asshole so he probably deserved it.",1068
gu5yh3,"We were seatmates and good friends so it was normal for us back then to just go through each others stuff. But i forgot that  i put my diary in my backpack the night before because i was hiding it from my brother. She finds it and proceeds to read it until she reaches the part where i wrote about my top three crushes with the whole ranking and writing the top 1 as the winner to my heart. I was busy taking notes from the chalk board and she was only supposed to borrow a pen from me so i was oblivious. Until i heard it, the familiar writing being announced to the whole class. I was flushed with embarrassment and couldn't contain my anger so i tried to grab my diary but she wouldn't let me reach it so i just went and stabbed her near the elbow downwards. The wound was long because i dragged the pen so there was a lot of blood. Our teacher was in another room so our classmates went to get her. I was staying by my seatmate's side finally realizing what i had done and panicking. Teacher came and immediately rushed her to the school clinic. I was so afraid of the repercussions of what i did but i remember being really surprised that when our teacher came back, i wasn't told to come to the principal's office or even just taken aside for a little chat. Nothing. Not even my classmates told on me. After finishing my notes i asked our teacher for permission to visit her in the clinic and she said okay. I went to the clinic to say i was really sorry but i stopped walking and hid behind the door when i saw that her mom was there. Her mom was asking her about what happened and i was shocked that she said she was just playing around with some of our classmates then mentioned a classmate who tripped and accidentally stabbed her with a pen. I felt so guilty that i ran to the bathroom and just cried. When i came back, they were gone and so were her things in our classroom. Next day our teacher announced that my seatmate was transferring to another school. Fast forward to many years after. Still see her on ramdom occasions, just simple smiles and waves and hi and hellos. Still guilty about what happened  but i just can't find the right timing to apologize. I can't just go and abruptly say my apology speech when i see her in the mall or someplace.  TL;DR: i stabbed my seatmate in 4th grade because she announced the contents of my diary. But when her mother came to the school she lied and said that it was just an accident. PS. First off i never thought ny confession would be getting this much attention. I'm a silent and awkward person and i can say that i am really bad at confrontations. But although that is the case and it is out of my comfort zone, i would really like to talk to her and catch up. Cause tbh, i already forgot about it (not completely) until i saw her last january just after new years. I saw her but i dont think she saw me. I think i have anxiety because something like this is already a big deal for me and my head goes into overdrive. I was mustering up the courage but then this pandemic happened. So what i decided to do is that i will chat her and ask her to meet up once the quarantine is over.  To those wondering why she transferred. Don't think that i havent thought of that but the real reason will have to wait until i get to talk to her again. My theory though, is that her mom still found out why she was stabbed and maybe thought she was being bullied.  Thank you for the upvotes and comments! I was really surprised",Well of course your classmates didn't tell on you. You had already stabbed one of them.,2390
gwnbqx,"So my room didn't have a door because it was broken and my room was next to the bathroom. My sister was in there for a very long time and he wanted her to get out because it was around 10PM but she didn't. So he looked into my room from where he was standing for a while and while i was playing a game he pulled the wire from my mouse in a very hostile way, we then said some things to eachother and i pushed him out of my room and then he tripped and fell down the stairs. Instead of helping him i felt so good and powerful, it was a scary feeling thinking back about it. That night he slept on the couche and i didn't say a word to him. The next day he went to the doctor and it turned out that he had a shifted vertebra. EDIT: Yes he is totally fine now and doesn't have a  permanent injury. For the people asking why he got mad at me for something my sister did, that's the story of my life and i don't know either. A couple years later my parents divorced and i live with my mother now.","Unfortunately, that feeling of empowerment is normal in that case.You should focus on what brought the tension to be so high   \[Edit\] what i mean with that is that you didn't push him because he was acting like a cunt, but because of some other previous happening",930
gxldcq,"I lied about being assaulted and I hate myself every day for it. Even before I lied about it, I have always had an issue with lying. I also have/had lots of issues with attention seeking. When I was merely 5 years old, I lied about my mom being in the hospital so I could have people pity me and talk to me. When the school eventually called my parents, my mom was very confused (as any parent would have been) but when I got home my parents didn’t make too much of a deal about it. They mostly just teased me and told me not say anything like that again.  For the most part, I did. Until later.  I won’t say how old I was specifically, but I was between the ages of 8-11. I had gotten into Law and Order SVU (which I really shouldn’t have been watching at the time) and I guess for some reason I got inspired to make up a complete and utter LIE to gain attention from my friends. Mind you, I was DEFINITELY old enough to know better, but the thought of having my friends pity me for something was so enticing for some reason.  I was having a bad day over something and none of my friends seemed to really care that I was upset. So, I started to make up this lie about being sexuaIly assaulted. I had said that it was a completely random stranger. For some odd reason, I was aware accusing someone I knew of rape was NOT okay and I specifically remember thinking, “No way am I going to ruin someone’s life for this.” What the FUCK was wrong with me?? I knew that doing THAT wasn’t okay but for some reason what I was doing was okay in my head?? And in the moment I felt no guilt for it. At all. I was getting the attention I wanted and my friends immediately felt horrible for me. And from then on, it just got worse.  I told my other 3 friends about it to see what their reaction would be, and of course, I got the attention I craved. Except this time, one of them told their dad.  Their dad ended up calling my parents and basically, I ended up having to talk to a social worker. THANKFULLY, they caught onto my lie right away and told my parents about it. When my parents confronted me about it, I cried and told them that it was all just a lie. From then on, my parents had a lot of trouble trusting me for a while. And as for my friends, whenever they brought it up I just told them I didn’t want to talk about it.  Now, I never bring it up anymore. I hate even thinking about it. I am the reason people don’t believe victims of sexuaI assault. I am the reason people belittle victims and why so many of them don’t speak up. I fucking hate myself for it so so so fucking much.  Earlier this year, I ended up having a close call with a suicide attempt and landed myself in the hospital. From then on, I had to get a therapist. I’m pretty sure she thinks I’m just a normal depressed teen, and nothing more. If she knew who I was, she would be disgusted with me. I can’t even be truthful with the one person I’m supposed to be honest with.  I don’t know how to get myself out of this hole i’ve put myself in. I don’t know why I romanticize such shitty things in my head. I just know the only thing that feels like a viable option is dying because then I won’t have to face any of the fucked up shit I’ve done in the past. Which is just me being a coward.  I’m so sorry to any victims of sexuaI assault who are reading this. I am so sorry that I am the reason you may have people in your life who don’t believe or listen to you. Your experiences are valid, and what you had to go through is unimaginable. I will NEVER be able to understand your pain, but I hope you heal from your past. I hope you know that you are stronger than what happened to you.   I’m not looking for empathy with this post. This is just something I’ve never told anyone and I’ve felt the strong need to get this off my chest. Edit: Hi. Just so all of you know, I’ve never even used reddit before. I mentioned this in another comment, but I’ve been looking for a “confession” type of website to get this off my chest for a while. It never really occurred to me to use reddit. I never expected this to get any attention at all. I was very surprised when I saw how many comments I got this morning. I really, really appreciate every single comment. I’ve been sitting here crying like a baby from all of the validating comments, but I also especially appreciate the harsh ones. They hold me accountable and remind me that what I did was NOT okay. That’s all I have to say. Thank you for listening to me.","You've gotta tell your therapist about this. It's one of the things that's been weighing on you for YEARS. If she can't handle that information, or if her attitude towards you changes, then look for another therapist who can help you better.

h0iogu,"Long story short: I work in a shop where a computer is required (basically an internet café), and my boss being the cheap asshole he is forces me to work with a shitty 2008 Samsung laptop with the shittiest specs, so slow and makes my interactions with customers awkward and my job painfully harder than it should be. I've been asking him to get a proper computer for months arguing that it would benefit him more than me (and it would) His argument is always ""this little guy got me to where I am now, he's our good omen!""

h11zgh,"I was pretty young at the time, had to have been about 7 or 8. My sister is about two years younger, so she would have been around 5 or 6 maybe.  I was really bored waiting for my mom to get out of the store. My dad would drive us around the parking lot until mom got out, and it would feel like an eternity. One day I decided to carve my sister's name into the door. I don't remember my intentions. I know they weren't malicious and I wasn't trying to frame her, but as a dumb kid it just made sense to carve her name there. My mom finished shopping and we went home. Once we got out of the car my parents noticed the carving.  Now what happened must have been a stupid chain of events, because I never can make sense of how this happened. My parents must have forgotten which seat we were sitting in, because obviously I had to be the one to have done it. They saw her name and IMMEDIATELY started scolding her. Probably scared the hell out of her into a panic, because when they asked (after accusing. Not the greatest parenting move on their part, but they were great parent overall) she agreed it was her. I stood there shocked and relieved, but also slightly guilty. I knew she had my back and it kind of shaped me covering her ass in the future. A little while back I brought it up to her as we were joking and reminiscing on the past. I was getting ready to thank her for that moment of covering my ass. Me: ""Remember that time mom and dad found your name carved in the car??"" Sister: ""Omg! Yes! I can't believe I did that. I don't even know what I was thinking carving my name into the door!""  My eyes got big and I just laughed with her.  To this day no one knows I did it. Not even my sister. She actually thinks SHE truly carved her name into the car door. Now part of me feels more guilt, but I'll never come clean. I die with this one.","Now she's probably gonna see this post and think ""That little cunt"".",949

I snapped every single one, they was quite a few, they were expensive and lets say school wasn't the richest. I think one day after, the teacher sat us all down and asked who snapped all the crayons, my heart was pounding! Me and my friend decided to blame it on a trouble maker, we said when we let him in, he was hanging around the crayons and we saw them being broken, because we were 2 faced goodie two shoes, we were instantly believed. The boy had to miss break for 1 week and get shouted at by the head mistress and eat dinner with the head. It also gave him strike, he already had a few. In year 3, he was expelled because he had done too many bad things. I'm pretty sure, me snapping crayons got him done.  TL; DR- 7 years ago, I snapped a lot of expensive crayons, my friend stuck up for me and we blamed it on a troublemaker, which was later used to expel him.","Imo teachers should know by now not to believe kids’ right away in situations like this without evidence.

he3cbt,"It just felt too big, too nebulous. I had no idea where to start. I kept putting it off and putting it off again, with no idea of what to do. I could have asked for help, but I didn't. How pathetic, I thought - every other student can manage to write one, but you need help? Just fucking put your head down and do it. But I didn't. With 24 hours to go, I had nothing. So I found a dissertation on Google, and I went through and changed it enough that I thought I could get away with it. I didn't. I have a hearing in a few days, and I can't see any likely outcome other than being kicked out with no degree. I haven't told anybody, besides a nice woman on the phone from Samaritans, because I didn't know who else to call. She didn't seem to know what to say though, and I can't blame her. What is there to say? You fucking idiot? How did you not ask anyone for help at any stage? Why are you the only person who can't fucking write their own dissertation? I'm so ashamed. So so ashamed. I can't tell my friends. Students have fun at university, but I feel as though there is an unspoken contract that everyone can do so because they are all working hard. I have broken my contract, and I cannot admit it.  This shame pales in comparison to the shame I feel regarding my parents. I am dreading telling them more than anything. They have been nothing but supportive my entire life. They are wondeful people. They have given me so much help, sacrificed so much for me to get a good education, and I have spat in their faces. I am ashamed to be their son.","I mean yes you shouldn't have done this of course, but where was your supervisor? Normally you agree on the topic with them, devise a plan of action and go through multiple drafts. I totally understand how a dissertation can feel like the entire weight of the world and then some (currently writing my thesis). It is a very lonely process and just the thought of how much you have to do alone can be so debilitating, I completely understand. And I can only imagine the desperation you must have felt to go through with this. Whatever the consequence, this does not and will not determine your life. Everything will be okay, sure it may be tough for awhile but it WILL get better and you will get through this.

hex7ud,"When I was 9 my older cousin (14) stayed with me and my family for a couple weeks. My cousin was a troublemaker and her parents had hoped that sending her to ours would keep her out of trouble for a little while. One day while she was over I asked if we could go to one of our local forest areas and make a fire to roast marshmallows. When we got down there we made a little makeshift campfire out of newpaper and sticks all on top a rock. Eventually my curiosity got the better of me and I started chucking different things into the fire. Leaves, sticks, pinecones, anything I could find in the little area we were in. Then I wondered what a leaf on a tree would do if we set fire to it. My cousin got her lighter and lit a small leaf on a near by tree. I stared at the reaction in awe and my cousin set a group of leaves on fire. We laughed as we watched the fire slowly engulf the branch. Once the fire burnt itself out we carried on setting fire to bushes and branches and then we realised that the fire wasn't dying out. In fact it spreading. My cousin started to freak out as she realised the fire wasn't stopping. The summer heatwave had made everything so dry that it was catching fire extreamly quickly. She grabbed my hand and we ran to the dirt road that was on the outskirts to the forest. But instead of calling 999 we just stood there. Watching it as it spread and spread and spread. My cousin almost called them multiple times but I kept telling her I didn't want to get into trouble so she never did. It had eventually spread so much that the fire department had trouble controlling it and had to order an evacuation of a nearby village. It was said to be the biggest fire the town had seen in 150 years. No one was hurt but it did take 10 hours to get under control. It wouldn't have been as bad if hadn't stopped my cousin calling 999 when we first lost control. Both I and my cousin had promised not to tell a soul but 12 years on and my guilt is still here, I still feel terrible about it. EDIT: Ok I think now is a good time to do an edit for extra info that I think needs to be said. Firstly, I am female.  Secondly, as a kid I was emotionally abused. My parents had a God at me for very small things like leaving a cup out instead of putting it in the sink. And I mean my mum use to call me useless and a worthless idiot at least three times a day. It wasn't until my cousin came to visit that I was allowed to leave my house with out an adult (even though a lot of kids could play in the park and go out on bikes ect). My aunt thought my parents 'strict' nature would pull her into shape. I was always seen as a 'good kid' when in actuality I was just submissive and did as I was told.  Lastly, the reason I won't tell the authorities the truth is that I have a very, let's say comfortable, job. The sort of job that holds all its employees to a very high standard. I have my own place. I have holidays booked for the future. I have a wonderful boyfriend who I love dearly and is helping me lose my submissive programing. If I was let slip that I had been the cause of one of the biggest fires our town has ever seen then I'd loose, almost, everything. I have been stressing and dealing with anxiety my whole life. I put it here in hopes that it would lift a portion of the guilt and anxiety I have harboured for 10+ years. Thank you to everyone who has said kind words to me I really appreciate it. Also thank you to everyone who has made jokes about it all. I have never laughed as much as I have today. Thank you.","The biggest thing I did was flood my school, yours definitely tops that lol",1714

hlw0qz,"  When I was 18 I worked at a movie theater. I was just promoted from usher to assistant manager, which meant I then had to buy and wear ties and stay until 1:00 am for $0.50 cents more an hour. A family came in and the mom and dad didn't want to see the R rated movie that their two teenage sons wanted to see ( I can't recall what the movie was). According to the corporate policy, a parent had to accompany the underage kids to see the movie, even if their parents gave consent. It was stupid. So the parents bought four tickets and left because the show didn't start for a few more hours. A few hours came and I noticed these kids came back in without their parents. They went into the theater and I waited for it to start before coming in and busting them/made them leave. The dad came in and was furious (I would be too, looking back). At the time I cared, but I have no idea why. I guess I just wanted to do my job well, but I should have said, 'fuck it, whatever'. If you're out there, family of four, I'm sorry!

I ask ""Why not?"" to which Robert replies ""because I said so!"" I left Roberts front gate and walked back down the street to my grandparents house again.. Robert follows me; ""You can't come innnn, you can't come iiiinnnnn!"" and follows me into my Grandad's garage where I told him to go away and get out of my driveway...  He ignored this request and continued with a barrage of insults and teasing me. I decided enough was enough and picked up a bottle of WD-40 and sprayed it right in his eyes.. To this day I have not seen Robert, nor do I know how he is, all I know is he got what he deserved and I'm not sorry.",Well I'm sure that loosened him up a bit,2278
ho1w0q,"When I was schooling (before internet was popular) video cassettes and magazines of adult content were popular among seniors. But obviously they were banned in the school (we most of us being kids must have been the reason ). So they often screened out classes and bags for adult content. So one day, one tape was caught in the gym, and it belonged to me and my friends. But the tape was on a cupboard so they couldn't find who it was. However, the principal said if no one comes forward he will add that to the school permanent record of all students in our class. So we all were afraid but luckily nobody in our class betrayed us.  We were looking for some solution to the issue. Somehow, a person from the previous class in the gym came to us. He was known to be a ""thug"" in the school with a bad rep. Anyway i had no personal problem with him. So he said ""if you give me 200 bucks, i will accept the tape is mine."" I m not proud of what we did next, but we agreed to his terms and collected 200 bucks within 2 days and gave it to him. And apparently he is a man of his words, he accepted and with his previous record nobody thought twice of it. And as I heard, even the principal was like ""oh this guy, no problem, we can't punish him, he is way too corrupted."" (He was not punished as well. And we got away.

hp8mmc,"Sounds a little vague, but I’ll clear it up. I work at a gas station, which has its own bakery. In the morning snacks are prepared, e.g. plain croissants, croissants filled with cheese, sausage rolls. That kind of stuff.  I work the evening shift and at some point during the evening the snacks get old so I have to throw them out, and write down how much I throw out. I can also write them off much earlier for personal use. There is a certain time where I have to throw them out, but I don’t. If customers ask for them, I’ll get them and sell them for a huge discount. The regular prices are €2.00-€2.50 and I’ll sell them for €1.00 and put that money in my own pocket.

hpj1nk,"So my family had some financial hardships growing up. I had a severe sickness at 7 and the bills from that were around $250k, which nearly bankrupted my parents. So I tried to get money for them. I started doing odd jobs like babysitting and shoveling snow, but it was never enough.  Until I saw $20 that was laying out on my teacher’s desk. I had gone into the classroom when no one was around during library time because I forgot something. So I just took it, because $20 was a lot of money for my family, and a lot of work for me. This kept going on for months and whenever I went to friends houses, relatives, anywhere. I searched for cash and took it. I became extremely sneaky and even learned how to pick locks.  I even stole out of my classmate’s backpacks, and one time I even stole cash out of a cash register. No one pays attention to a sickly looking child.  I have mixed feelings about this. My family needed the money, but so did everyone I took it from. I went to school in a poor working class neighborhood and was taking money from people who needed it just as much as I did. I gave my parents the money is small amounts so they never suspected it.  I just had to get this out there. Edit: thank you for all the support. The positivity on this post has really gotten me to start and forgive myself. I’m now in school trying to make a better life for myself and I haven’t stolen anything in years. My family’s financial situation is still awful (mostly due to more medical bills and insurance) but I’m now able to realize these things are not my fault and not my burden. When I was a kid I blamed myself and tried to make up for it but I now know it wasn’t my burden to bear. Edit2: some of the details are a little fuzzy because I was young as suffering from trauma. I didn’t start babysitting for money until I was 10. An 8 year old needs a babysitter lol. And I think the $1000 dollars is from all the money I made and stole over 3 years, so I don’t think the amount is correct. Sorry if this wasn’t clear in the post!

i0lxo8,"About a year ago I have been taking a course on that was a bit challenging. The scores of tests are usually announced online in my college. Professors sometimes do office hours where you get to look at your exam paper and make sure he/she grades it correctly. After the scores are announced I wanted to check my answers and maybe get some extra points if I could. When I entered my professor's office he told me he has taken away the exam papers and I would have to find my exam paper from hundreds of papers. He showed me a huge stack of papers in one of the drawers. Once I found my paper I realized I 've been looking for the previous exam papers from couple months ago but grade was way higher than the one I'm looking for. Since the cover page of the papers are exactly the same I decided to try convince my professor that the previous paper is the latest test we did. I pretend cheking my answers and I told him that I didnt have any objection to the grading of the questions. Then I asked him if he might wrote my test score wrong to digital database of my college. He quickly checked his computer and said 'You are right, I will fix it right away' my heart was beating so hard because I would be busted so hard if he just take a look to the second page of my paper. Anyway, I said thank you for his time and put my paper back to the fat stack of papers and quickly placed where I've taken them.

The boxes had Reese's, Snickers, Twizzlers, Crunch, etc. I went all around my neighborhood to sell. As mentioned, the boxes weren't big, so it wasn't particularly difficult to sell everything within 1-2 days.  The thing was, the administration at my middle school didn't hold anyone accountable for not selling or keeping the money. They didn't mark down any names. Kids would just hand them the cash and they'd store it in the safe.  By the time March rolled around, with three weeks to go before the trip, I had made just over $500. For an eighth grade kid, I felt like Bill Gates. The field trip was one of the best experiences of my life. And yes, I fully realize that I mooched off of my classmates who were honest about the fundraiser, and I totally played my neighbors and other people in my community who I knew.

Usually kids in my school swap and return eachothers Haunter, So therefore both of them have Gengar so it was a win-win for both. I thought that maybe I could get my own Gengar if he handed his Haunter to my Caterpie. When our classes ended, I saw him in the classroom playing some pokemon a little bit before he left. I asked him if he wanted to evolve his Haunter and I would return it after the trade. We did it then i quickly unplugged his Game link Cable and booked it.

ieaq01,"I was 11 when my eldest sister was killed in a traffic accident in front of me and my middle sister. This came less than two years after my mother had died. (I later found out my mother died by suicide.) My dad had remarried and my stepmother was a mere ten years older than me. Although we had started well, we no longer had a good relationship. Stealing money at home was my way of getting what I thought was rightfully mine. Me and my surviving sister were used as slave labour at home. We didn’t receive an allowance or pocket money, yet were expected to do all the chores, and to the standard the queen would expect. Washing, ironing, cleaning both their cars, vacuuming, doing the dishes, etc. Other than make dinner for my dad, my stepmother didn’t lift a finger around the house it seemed, and my dad certainly didn’t. My sister stole food, I stole money. We were both beaten black and blue for it by our dad, but we still did it. One day while looking for money in my dad and stepmother’s bedroom, I opened a drawer and inside was an envelope with my dead sister’s name on it. It also said the envelope contained something like £23. It was from the hospital and was part of the contents of her purse when she died. I knew it was wrong, but I thought “What the hell?” So I took a couple of pounds. Later, I took more. And more. Eventually, all the money was gone, yet I left the envelope in the drawer.  Well, obviously the theft was discovered. I was beaten black and blue, and green and red and purple for it. As an adult, I guess I understand the anger that comes from that disrespect. However, I think I was probably only 12 years old by then. I’m now 47 years old. I don’t care that I stole money from my dad all the time till I went into foster care aged 15. (As a side note, when I went into foster care and ever since in my life, I have NEVER stolen anything ever again.) I just feel so ashamed of stealing THAT money. The money that had been in my dead sister’s purse.  I have donated money to charity many times over the years. I’ve also spent many years volunteering in a charity shop and donated unwanted goods to them to sell. I don’t know if I can really make up for the £23 that had been in my dead sister’s purse, no matter what I do. Practically, there’s a side of me that does say the money should have been spent or donated to a charity at the time anyway. Is there any point in holding onto it?

ih8i5i,"Me and my buddy in 5th grade were some badass little punks man... y’all remember the book fairs at school right? All those cool looking books that you’ve always wanted would all be just sitting there, waiting to be bought. But we didn’t buy them.

We would wait until the bell rang for everybody to leave the cafeteria, because  when that bell rings, all hell breaks loose and hundreds of little kids go scrambling making it almost pathetically easy to shove a book up our shirts and go running off...

ikis08,"Just like the title says. When I started college, I had this idea that everything would be easy and simple because I would be studying something that I was passionate about. I was not entirely wrong. However, the problem started when I had teachers who said things like ""1 + 1 = 3"" and in the exams, if you answered ""1 + 1 = 3"" you got 0, because it was really 2. Mediocre teachers. At first, I did not try to cheat or anything. I thought was wrong and yada yada... but all that changed for me when I had to take the same class for the fourth time. Class that I could have passed the second time easily if the teacher had given me in the last exam 1 point out of the 6 that the answer was worth, because although the answer was incorrect, the procedure to find the answer was correct, my error / mistake was by placing a wrong number (The stress of a test I guess made me see an 8 instead of a 6). After that, I had enough. I realized that teachers cared more about the grade you get than what you learn in class. So, from that moment on, I started to cheat and cheat as much as I could and on every class that I felt had bad teachers and wanst worth it. What did i do? Take out my cell phone during the exam, copy myself from and with classmates, have someone who was good at the subject come in and take the exam and put my name on it, pay a private teacher to send me the answers by message, use the old works of other people who had already seen that class and change words or the topic of them, when reviewing the exam erase some incorrect answers and put in correct ones and tell the teacher that he made a mistake when correcting my exam, yada yada.. There were so many things I did to pass different subjects / classes: Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Chemistry, and many others. I was studying 2 majors at the same time, the pressure I felt at 18/19 was too much and the frustration was indescribable. I wanted to graduate and finish college. And yes, I made it. I end everything and finally I graduated in 2019. I will not lie, I am happy with what I achieved, but I know it was wrong because there are certain things that I did not learn. However, those things I know are not entirely my fault. It's the fault of those mediocre teachers who didn't teach their classes correctly and were more concerned about grades than someone learning what was important. And if you are wondering.. yes.. I also cheated on my Final Projects / Thesis.  Edit: wow. I never expected this to blow up. Thanks for the awards strangers! Answering questions:  People are wondering what majors I'm talking about. I'm not going to say anything specific. However, I can guarantee that in what I work and can work on does not affect or risk anyone's life. I am not a doctor, I don't make medicines or build houses, bridges, etc. If you need a company for an example: Google / The CW People ask what I meant by ""bad teachers.""  I'll give you  another example: A teacher made us do a project for 3 months using X program and method only to tell us later that nothing we did is done like that in the workplace. 3 months wasted on learning something that, in the end, was obsolete.  Also, what clas took me to pass it four times? Well.. was a mandatory course that uni make everyone see at the very begining (filter mandatory courses). So, everyone that was going to study on that uni had to take it. My first teacher was bad, 85% of the class had to take it a second time, the second time had bad luck and made the error that cost me 6 points on the exam, the third time I couldnt make it to the last exam because there was an accident on the highway, so.. couldnt make it in time and the fourth time i pass cheating because i was angry about the other 3 times. Oh, and the only way to pass the class was only doing exams. 3 exams, everyone with value of 33.33% percent on final grade. So, you fail or miss one, then u are done unless you pass with godd grade the other ones. To this day i still dont know why i had to take a course that test us about if a triangule is similar or equal to another triangule. In my line of work, we dont use that. Just because I cheated on almost everything doenst mean I didnt learn or study somethings or try not to do it sometimes. I had to always study just in case my plan backfired at me. One time, we had 3 exams. I did the first one without cheating, the second one I decided to cheat because the teacher took away 4 points because he didnt like how I wrote my answer, on the second one someone was caught cheating (Teacher saw 3 exams with the same mistakes on the answers) and on the third one, I already had enough grade to pass the class, so.. didnt have to cheat at all. Bad luck for those who were planning on cheating on the third exam because the teacher brought with him 3 other teachers to watch and keep an eye on during the examn. Also, not all the teachers were bad. Some were awesome. Gave us amazing projects and their clases were worth taking. Those were the clasess were I didnt cheat at all and had grades of wich I'm proud. Thats why the title says ""(Almost) everything"".   For those who said that I had to change my degree, stop studying one or look for another university: I studied one of the majors because I was passionate about it, yet there were subjects that I did not feel were related to the degree.  I liked the other one, but I studied it more out of obligation than anything else (Yes. I could have stopped studying this one.) Regarding going to other College, I am not from the USA, my country does not have many university options. Those are very limited here. And yeah. I have 2 majors. Those can help me open some doors, but.. in the end.. those doors are nothing if I dont work hard on my work place and do my best. And sure enough, I know the things that are important on my field. The ones that I REALLY need on my day to day life.","My roommate literally cheated his way through an engineering degree. He wasn’t very bright but was really social and latched onto a kid that wasn’t really social but was really bright.

These facts, coupled with complete emotional burnout led me to do what I did next. One day in late August, my bio-Dad phoned me to tell me my Granny had died. I hadn't seen her for almost 8 years by then but I was sad for him. He told me that I would be expected at the funeral. It's probably worth noting here that my bio-Dad and I are not close either- I see him once a year and have done for the last decade plus. I'm not close with any of his side of the family, and my anxiety went into overdrive at just the thought of being in a room full of basically grieving strangers. I told him I would ask work, thinking they would probably say no. Turns out, the law means they have to say yes, so I was granted a day's leave to attend the funeral. I saw my opportunity and I ran with it. Work thought I was there, I told my Dad work had said no, and I had a lovely day off playing video games and napping. I felt pretty guilty at the time and do occasionally even now. Just wanted to get this off my chest.","What you did was self-care, you shouldn't feel guilty about it. We all need some space sometimes to rest, reflect and do whats good for the soul. My favourite days are when I'm able to stay home, don't have anywhere to be, comfy clothes and a freshly made bed (I'm aware this makes me sound boring but for me thats self-care, its different for everybody). Whether its enjoying a quiet house, a break from a routine, reading a book, bike riding or climbing a mountain,  or a day of pampering and relaxing, its very important that whichever applies to you, everyone needs a ME day from time to time.

j1fzuo,"As a child, I sometimes liked to do ""telephone pranks"". Usually these pranks were very tame. I would call a random number and creepily breathe into the phone while the other person would say ""Hello?? Hello??"" until they eventually hung up and I moved on to the next number. One afternoon, though, some middle-aged lady got super triggered. I guess she was the 90s version of a Karen. When she realized I was a child, she gave me an angry lecture about how I was misbehaving and how it wasunacceptable. I don't know what it was about her but something about her butthurt yelping got me really triggered too. I was actually a very sweet and well-behaved boy and most adults loved me. Perhaps because of that, it really rubbed me the wrong way when she called me a ""snotty brat"". I felt treated unfairly and wanted to give her a shitty day. So I laughed in a rude tone and said something like: ""Yeah? Well you couldn't possibly know cuz you're dumb as rocks."" There was a short pause - she was clearly stunned by my words - before she totally freaked out. At this point, I let loose like my 10-year old tongue had rarely let loose before. I called her a nasty old witch, a dumb crackwhore, a disease... you name it. Any insult that came to my mind I promptly hurled at her. Some of the things I called her were hilarious but some of them were 100% over the boundary... as in, I'd be angry if my child said them to an adult (let alone a stranger). At one point, the lady said: ""Just wait you little brat, I have your number. I'll call your parents."" At the time, most telephones weren't capable of knowing and showing the caller's number. It was still a pretty new technology and so when the lady claimed to have my landline phone number (the one I was calling from), I assumed it was just a bluff. Unfortunately, it wasn't. About 15 minutes later she called back and my mom picked up before I could stop her. At this point, I was genuinely terrified. Some of the things I had said were pretty horrible and I knew my mom would hate it. Surely, there would be some ugly punishment. Instead, however, I heard my mom reply in a polite but skeptical tone: ""Noooo, you must have dialed the wrong number, my son would never do that."" Like I said, I was usually a goody-two-shoes who was always nice to everyone and brought home good grades from school. So, it made sense for my mom to be very skeptical (and yet, that angry lady was totally right about what I had done). After some back and forth, my mom called me and said: ""There's a lady here who claims that you called her before and insulted her horribly. Is that true??"" I gave her my most innocent smile and said: ""Huh? Insulted her? No... I was playing in my room, I didn't call anyone."" My mom just said: ""Yeah, I thought so."" Then she went back on the phone and said to the lady: ""I just asked my son and he says he didn't do any such thing. I also don't think he would ever do such a thing. Frankly, you seem like you've got some screws loose. Don't call us anymore, you probably misdialed or maybe you imagined the whole thing."" I heard the lady screaming and shouting in anger and then my mom hung up on her and simply went back to her gardening work. I've never told my mom that that ""crazy lady"" actually hadn't been crazy and that she had been saying the truth.",Wait until you are 30 and tell your mom. Best prank,1862
j225vg,"Before corona shut my church down, I was abusing Percocet, gabapentin, and alcohol just about every single day (especially percs on Sunday’s when I would teach the children.) I remember one Sunday, coming down from a ecstasy roll as I was talking to the kids about God’s love. Pupils the size of discs in the church house.  Multiple Sundays, I took Percocet before arriving  and puked my brains out in the bathroom, 10 minutes before service started.  I feel terrible about this because I signed an agreement to refrain from abusing drugs while being in the position to teach the kids but, obviously, I broke that agreement, continually for months.  I’ve been clean for 4 months now but the guilt still eats me up. EDIT: Thank you everyone for taking time to comment on this post.  Part of the guilt/shame I didn’t mention was that I wasn’t fully “there” with them. I mean, I did the best I could before the pills but I felt inadequate because I was so anxious (trying to cope with my then unknown/unresolved trauma and social anxiety) However, on the percs/gabas, I felt I was more relaxed and less on edge and I believed that was good for everyone. I truly believed I was a better person and more present because I no longer felt any of my anxiety or emotional pain. What a slippery slope opiates are.  I’m not justifying my actions, simply giving more context to my situation.  I am coping much more healthily now. It’s hard hard work. But I just look forward to the day I’m a better and more present “me”. Again, thank you all for your incredibly kind comments. I wasn’t expecting them at all.","Man/Woman we’re not perfect and We’re all fighting our own demons!! You cannot be judged!

j7hax9,"This topic came up recently when my mom and I started talking about my childhood. I never admitted to this and told everyone it was an accident. Here’s what happened. We were asked to draw something on a piece of paper. I forgot what he did to me or what happened but I remembered I intentionally stabbed him on the head with my pencil. When he started crying and babbling how I stabbed him, I denied it at first but he wont stop crying. They checked out his head and found a mark of a pencil then it was confirmed. I also started crying and told everybody that I was just stretching out since I’m tired from drawing and when I dropped my hands holding a pencil, his head just happens to be on the way. They believed that and turns out that kid was actually being bullied by other kids and then he dropped out. Everytime I look at our class picture I cant help to feel sorry.","The girl who sat behind me in fourth grade constantly hit me in the back of the head or stuck things in my ears, pulled hair, etc. I had finally had my fill and warned her that I would stab her the next time she did it. Then I got up, went to the pencil sharpener and showed her the freshly sharpened tip as I sat down. Not five seconds later came the hardest slap she'd ever given me. Without hesitation I swung around and stuck that pencil deep into her arm. It was so deep I couldn't pull it back out. She ended up at the hospital and I ended up in the principal's office. Surprisingly enough she admitted to her behavior and since it was (luckily) 1978 I just got a few swats. We were both back in class the next day with two rows of desks between us. I saw her at a reunion and she still has the scar 40 years later. We still don't like each other. Lol",1374

That just made it bigger, and before I knew it, a large part of the field, next to some houses, was burning.  I ran down the street to a house where I knew a firefighter worked.  His wife called the fire department and they put it out before any houses burned down.  Later that day, they came to my house to present me with my very own fire fighter's helmet (a kid version) after asking me some questions.  They wrote it off to a magnifying effect of some broken glass they had found in the burnt grass.  I never found out if my parents suspected me, and that fire fighter's helmet on my bed post was a massive source of guilt for years!  Certainly never tried anything like that again.",Wow reminds when I was I was walking to school and was playing with matches in an earlier grade. Maybe 3rd.

jayw88,"I was really poor. Like, really hungry all the time poor. My friend however had a nice middle class life. She and I would spend every single weekend in its entirety together for the better part of a decade. I loved her but I was jealous because *she never ate anything* and it was by choice. Even when I stayed the night I was going hungry.  Anyway she had one of those giant parking meter “piggy banks” that was probably 4 foot tall and filled half way up with change. She asked me to help her count it one day and I eagerly agreed. (I have always loved counting change, even now that I’m in my mid twenties and financially stable). So we get to work. Quarters over here, pennies there, all in dollar groups, nice and tidy.  She leaves the room for some reason, probably for the bathroom, and like an instinct I start gathering as many quarter piles as I can without it being blatantly obvious that a bunch are missing. I put them in my towel from swimming the day before and folded it up to look casual. I’m sure it was pretty obvious.  Anyway I’m pretty sure she knew because she looked at the towel at some point and asked me when I was going home shortly after. I feel really terrible about it to this day. I was just so hungry back then and when my brother and I found quarters we’d always run to the liquor store and by cheap little Debbie snacks. EDIT: Thank you to everyone that extended their kind words and experiences! I’m trying to reply to everyone that I can but I would like to clarify that I do not have contact with this person anymore.

jcariy,"I bought 3 games with that money, the reason I feel specifically bad it’s because I feel like my mom would probably said yes to me if I asked. But nooo, I just went on buying stuff. The guilt is too much because she is wondering what happened and I had to lie (she didn’t asked me so that’s even worse, she trusts me) I told her I erased her bank cards from my accounts and my phone to prevent (more like future) temptations (that’s a half lie, I did deleted them. But after buying the stuff)  and now I just said stop to myself. I’ve seen articles on kids spending over 1000 dollars, I’m not that crazy to do such a big purchase but it’s still not right. But better now before I start making bigger purchases. So right now I’m just secretly paying her the money by putting the little cash I get from my father on her wallet. And I’ll never ask for her debit card again. I don’t want to abuse her trust. Not anymore, she’s a really good person. I’ll save what I have to save to buy gift cards. But I’ll never touch her money without her permission. I’ll better keep that promise to myself, it’s the least I can do. Edit: guys, I told my mother that it was me, never felt so relieved, she didn’t get mad, she actually laughed and told me “I knew it.” And I was like .__. I told her I was sorry and I removed all her cards. It wasn’t as bad as I thought I would be.

jd0lat,"Title says it all really, and I'm not proud of my actions as they could have had dire consequences on me as I got older. I was 14/15 and had a fetish for LEGO, coming from not a poor family but one I understood didnt have enough money to just buy me the toys that my friends had and I felt jealous and the theft felt justified. It started small with pokemon cards and eventually I had enough confidence to steal boxes of lego. Sometimes I'd empty a box in my bag, other times if the box fit I'd slide it right in my bag. Always cautious of cameras and finding blind spots, there was once that I got caught (almost). The manager came round the corner and asked me to take whatever I put in my bag out. So I did, unzipped the rucksack and took out (from the top) a small £15 lego set. He took it from me and told me to leave (not barred from the shop).The manager was unaware that I had set 75058, in loose bags, still inside my bag. That was a £90 set back in the day. I couldn't believe I got caught and it definitely scared me, but I wasnt deterred.  Over the next few months after that I would enter the shop with a friend or 2 and we would all bring our bags for more space. More bag space = more profit.  The stealing eventually died down but I had stolen at least a grand and a half, way more lego than necessary. I became greedy.  A few years later when I got bored with lego I sold them all and made a hefty amount of money. I don't stand by my actions made as a teenager but at the time I was receiving both lego and adrenaline.  TL;DR I stole a lot of lego from toys'r'us and managed to get away with it.

We had departmental targets that we had to reach each day which included signing up guests who were checking in for our loyalty programme. Basically if you were part of the programme you would earn points every time you stayed at a hotel in the chain and then be able to spend these points on benefits like discounts in the restaurants and free stays. Sounds like a good deal but the downside is the constant barrage of spam emails from the hotel.  To incentivise the receptionists to convince guests to sign up for the programme, we would also earn some of these points that we could spend on the same benefits if we signed up a guest during a check-in. Persuading people to sign up for the programme was a lot harder than you might think so to create a win/win situation for myself I would take their email address from their check-in form and sign them up for the programme without their knowledge, earn points and also meet the departmental goals. This was a major no-no from a company policy point of view but kind of encouraged by my managers. Eventually I started to un-tick the box on their loyalty programme resignation that would turn off the marketing spam emails but I'm afraid a lot of people are probably still receiving those annoying marketing emails today.  Eventually after 2 years I had signed up around 3000 people and earned a lot of points using my devious methods and was able to stay in some very nice hotels.  Edit: I did this in Europe before GDPR came along. TLDR - I signed up guests for a loyalty programme they didn't know about and I earned enough points to stay in hotels for free",That sounds just like that story of middle employees being encouraged by their managers to sign up customers for checking accounts and whatnot at Wells Fargo,1667
ki3cyi,"I worked at this stadium for a couple years. I’m always dreaming and scheming, and I came up with a plot and I’ll explain in full detail Usually all hawkers stand in line to get their beer coolers topped up when empty. They give you your beer, you give them the money from the last run you made (which was $275) and you would rinse and repeat. I would drop my beer tray off at the refill table saying I have to take a wizz, never questioned, and would leave to the restroom without paying. By the time I would get back, my beer tray would be full, and I would just grab them and go Being 23 at that time it was amazing money, with most nights me stealing 2 cases of beer to sell, $550, plus the $1-200 in tips I would normally get. Wasn’t easy work tho, the stairs were narrow and tall, and you can’t see them with a hawker cooler in front of you, many nights selling 6+ trays, then grabbing frozen cold beers in the winter to give to your customers, without gloves cuz good luck handling money with gloves on I ended up getting fired for drinking a beer and watching the game after our shift was done, which ended 3/4 thru the game.

The accident was falling for the cutest boy in my hall. The sex with fantastic. I partied all night with my residents. I wasn't 21 yet, but I used my fake ID to buy the alcohol. l  I made edibles for my residents. I never wrote any them up. I never did room searches. I still went to my sorority events. I went to Cochella weekend, Big Bear and Vegas weekends without telling my supervisors. I didn't do my job and had a lot of fun while taking advantage of the free food and housing. I used the hall budget to buy more alcohol and snacks for the floor instead of throwing informative hall programs. No one got hurt. I had two rules. 1. No inebriated driving and 2. No throwing up after Hallo-weekend. I figured they should know how to hold alcohol by then.  If anything, they were more willing to come to me in an emergency because they knew I was chill and I wouldn't get them in trouble. My residents kept my negligence quiet because they didn't want me to get fired. All the other RA's were lame. They gave me an award for being the top RA that year and asked me to come back the following year. I declined that offer. I just never told them that I was a terrible influence.

Stunicorn was running around knocking on doors, calling all of us for a dorm meeting because he had a big announcement we all needed to be there to hear. He explained that the Lion King (1993) had been re-released in theaters and asked if anyone wanted to come with him to see it. 2 hours later our entire dorm is at the box office and Stu is explaining how excited he is that we’re doing this, that it’s his favorite movie, that none of his frat brothers wanted to come and he would have felt lame coming alone. He was super easy to get along with and we all ended up getting to know him a little better.  We never saw him again.",1891

kr3gux,"So here I was, the final month of 5th grade, I was 11 years old. I was a honor roll student during those times, so a lot of pressure was on my shoulders obviously. Today, not so much, I am a shadow of what I used to be. BUT NONETHELESS, it was around the time of Easter, and the end of the school year was near. I could practically smell the summer vacation. But I just didn't feel like doing homework or much at all during class, so I thought, what if I made up a ridiculous story and see where it gets me? Since it was a while after Easter, when we usually went to my grandparents in the countryside to celebrate it, they had those old traditional houses, and there was this really shitty, Soviet-era stove. And just as I was looking at it, my parents were reminiscing this story where I looked at the stove and thought it was a good idea to poke my hand in it when I was about 4 years old. That's when it came to me: the story would be that I went to my grandparents and because they have a shitty stove, when I was talking to them I leaned back on it, completely unaware that it was on, and burned my hand pretty bad, but mostly my right hand. So, you know, I can't really write now, I'm so sorry.... I did this for like a month, I showed up at school with some kind of bandages on my right hand fingers, they were kinda sticky as well, so whenever I came back home, right before entering the apartment block, I would have to stick it off, and white sticky stuff would be stuck on my hands for a while. At one point my dad asked me what the hell is with that white stuff on my hands, I said it was paint from arts class. Obviously, some teachers and kids called me out, but I would stick to it and nobody really mind it much. It actually worked, mostly because nobody really cared. I didn't do homework or anything at all for a month, then shortly afterwards summer vacation came. I don't really feel guilty about it at all, it was wonderful. Now I've moved on much, much bigger and greener pastures... I guess being that stupid at 11 doesn't help when you grow up at all...","I have always been naturally super pale.

l5k3ln,"  This happened 4 years ago and my memory isn't the best plus this is my first post so ye. So for some background, I'm 14m and live in a small village (around 2k ppl) and from when we started to around 12 years old we would go to this forest near us to play. There were a main ""camp"" with a wind shelter and a fireplace where the teachers were. When I was around 10 we went there with our class and we went in to play. After around an hour a group of kids came running from a more remote part of the forest saying they saw a bear.(Note: Brown bears live in our region but i've never heard of one this close to the main village.) We believed them and kept playing. When we were gonna pack up me and a friend remembered that we forgot our jackets at the ""base"". We went back and got them and when we started walking back to the camp when we started talking about the bear. He proposed that we should scream and pretend we saw it. So we did. We screamed and ran back saying that we saw the bear. No one really questioned us and we just went back to school. When i got home i told my mom what happened (the lie not the truth) and she said i should call the local newspaper to tell them, and so i did. The reporter asked questions and i answered. When we were finished he talked to my mom and she said that i would never lie and that i was ""the truth himself"". It got published with a pic of me and for one or two years after people would ask me if i was the one who saw that bear. The friend i was with haven't said anything but one of the kids who originally claimed they saw the bear said that they never saw it. Its luckily never been brought up since that, I just wanted to get this off my chest and get some unbiased opinions. Sorry for the long post.","Thanks to you, somewhere in the woods this conversation occurred,  ""I thought I told you to stay away from the village?!"" ""But mom, I never went there!!""

laamj3,"I used to live next to this really cool house that had been abandoned and foreclosed on.  I barely knew the people who used to live there, but I did know they'd left in a hurry and only took what they absolutely needed.  This was during the real estate crash and the bank had bigger fish to fry so they padlocked the doors and sat on the house for years.  Well I have to admit, my curiosity got the best of me.  It's not like I'm a criminal.  I've never even shoplifted or tried to lie my way out of a speeding ticket ... but the house was there, empty of humans, and full of nice things, and I had free reign of the connecting back yard and could come and go as I please without anyone ever knowing.  One day I took an old pair of bolt cutters and broke into the basement bulkhead, and my friend and I combed all through the house and took all kinds of stuff.  I got clothing, sports gear and kids' toys, decorations, tools ... I'll even admit to pantry items.  Those were lean times for my family as well.  Anyway, once we were done I closed the house back up again, but since the padlock was now broken, someone else ended up breaking in later and they weren't so good about closing back up again when they left.  The basement bulkhead was left standing open during winter and the pipes froze and burst, flooded the basement and first floor.  The bank eventually came around and found the situation.  They shut off the water and padlocked the doors again.  I never went back in and eventually the house sold at auction.  I still have some of the things I took from that house.","I remember my father used to take my sister and I in the summer up to Michigan (ann Arbor area) and explore bank owned homes.

lc8xr5,"When I was in the 11th grade, I rushed home quickly because I knew I had a bad report card, and knew that my mom would be home soon. I had a tough childhood due to my abusive mother, so i knew it would be...bad. However, upon arriving to the front of my apartment was the usual bunch of tenants who liked to sit outside and talk with each other. This worried me, because I wouldn't be able to get the report card with them around. I felt that they would lecture me and tell my mom. I stayed up in my unit, looking out the window, waiting for them to disperse, yet, they never did, so, out of desperation, I took a spatula, hidden in a brown Ralphs paper bag (lol), and went down stairs. When the group of older tenants seemed to not be paying attention to me, I began to nervously proceed with my plan in desperation. As I saw the edge of my report card under the mailbox door, I quickly tried to retrieve it but was unsuccessful. Suddenly, I was caught by C, a 60-something year old man, he looked at me and said, ""Hun, the fuck are you doing?"" all the other adults turned to look at me. Finally, I confessed to what was happening, that I wanted my report card so my mom wouldn't see and explained that she was on her way home. I was expecting punishment from the group, they stared at me, then nodded. All of them began to help me. They all knew how my mom was. A, a mid 30's woman, who lived next door, went to keep a lookout for my mom's car. C couldn't get the mailbox open so he called J over. Suddenly, J, a 40 something year old man who lived a unit over from me, quickly took out his pocket knife and BUSTED the mailbox open. I couldn't believe what was happening, but I grabbed my report card regardless. How was I going to explain a broken mailbox to my mom, she was obviously going to connect the dots, right? The others in the group hurried to try and close the busted mailbox the best they could. We were able to close it, but I knew once my mom attempted to open her mailbox and couldn't open it, that I would be doomed. Within 5 minutes of that altercation, my mom came home to see me in front with the group of older tenants and immediately proceeded to get her mail, all of us were SILENT. She couldn't open her mailbox, immediately after she attempted to open the box, THE LIVE IN MANAGER SHOWED UP. My heart was pounding to death as he began watching my mom struggle to open the mailbox. Luckily for me, without a second thought, he went on to say ""We have gangsters in this area, a lot of this kind of stuff happens, don't worry though, we'll get it fixed"" My mom accepted that explanation and I never said another word on it for YEARS. I did get better grades though, the tenants had made me promise to in exchange for their support.",Wholesome story,2525

I found legit sources for my bibliography and then made all the details and ""facts"" up, attributing those facts to my very real sources .

m4n0hk,I’ve managed to keep this one a secret.  During my last year of college I was working two jobs. I also hated writing papers to begin with. I was over the whole school thing and just wanted to start working and making money.  I went online and found someone who wrote papers for money. This person wrote me my last two essays of my final year of college. I got good grades on both and was never questioned on anything. To this day I have never told anybody about this. Not my wife. Not my best friend. Nobody.  Feels good to finally tell someone.,I used to write college papers for money. Haha.,1781
m4zqze,"Okay so basically this all started when I was drunk and it was 3AM. My friend had given me her phone right before she fell asleep. It was open to text messages/our friend group chats and I don’t know what came over me, but I had to search my name. I wasn’t expecting anything bad, but what I found made me really upset.  I found messages from two people in my friend group saying that I’m a bitch for deciding what we do as a friend group (making plans), messages about them ignoring my calls because they didn’t want to go somewhere with me, talks about not wanting to be my partner for school projects, them talking about me not taking their feeling seriously, and overall just negative things. I agreed with some of the things they were saying about me, such as me making plans for the group but I ALWAYS try to get their opinion on what we should do when hanging out and sometimes don’t even get a response. The texts were always over exaggerated and sometimes not true.  I woke up the next day feeling ashamed for reading the messages but at the same time I felt like I had no one to talk to about it. I’m really hurt because I never thought friends could say that kind of stuff about me. Especially from someone who I thought was my best friend. I’ll probably feel really guilty about reading through these messages for a long time, but the feeling of betrayal will definitely last longer.  I wish I never looked, but now I don’t know what to do now that I’m in this position.",I got a text intended for someone else but it was about me and it wasn't friendly at all AND she was in the same room at the time.

m90sb1,"I hated reading books sometimes, because my elementary school teacher would give so much homework. Sometimes I would miss out on sleep and yet, we were expected to read at least an extra 20 minutes or more if it wasn't at least a chapter. So one day, I made up a book that doesn't even exist. Title was The Lucky Leprechaun. Summary: He was happy because for the first time in history, he actually found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.","TLDR:  Your teacher didn’t care.  Teacher here: Book logs are such BS. Forcing kids to read makes many hate it. In my experience, I had the kids who loved reading, and who told me all about their books with no prompting, and others who forged the whole log. Either kids are intrinsically motivated, or they are not. Teachers do not know every book in existence, and I have enough to do already without researching the books that 65 middle school kids claim to be reading. That whole program was BS, thank heavens we no longer do it.",1403
mbkgbh,"When I was in 4th grade I saw my mom (who was married to my dad) kiss a family friend (also married with kids who went to my school) passionately on the lips at a small house party. I wasn’t too phased by it at the time. I already knew there was something going on between them and as a 4th grader I didn’t really understand what cheating was, or that it was a really big deal in marriages. I ended up telling my group of friends about it on the playground and I named names. They knew the man as well. They were a very well known, well-loved family.  That night my one friend tells her mom what I said and the next day my mom gets a call asking if it was true. When my mom came into my bedroom to ask me what I had said on the playground, and if I had used the word “affair” (I had) I totally panicked, I could tell from the tone of her voice, the seriousness of it, that I had done something really really bad. I vividly remember the dread I felt about this. I was already afraid of my mother’s anger and rages over small things and this was the worst thing I had ever done. So I lied and said that I hadn’t said anything. That night I remember the massive knot in my stomach from fear and I thought to myself that I wish I didn’t have to wake up the next morning. I was a wreck for weeks. My mom asked me three times if I was sure I was telling the truth, and I said yes all three times. I learned, after confessing the truth to my mom over 5 years later, in high school, that apparently everyone had believed my story and thought that my friend, the other girl, was just making up stories. I feel so bad to this day when I think of it.","I’m sorry but fuck your mom for putting you in that situation by asking if it was you.

mcd8qj,"I don't know why I'm mentioning this now, over fourteen years after the incident, but this is an anonymous account, so fuck it, here goes. Back in the late 2000's (around '06), I went to a little private school. In said private school, you'd get a report card at the end of every month, that had your grades on it. (we weren't too big on the internet, and this was the only way to have access to grades back then)These cards were handed to you in Community (basically homeroom) which was at the end of the day. The best part about these report cards was that they only had the date of the day it would be recieved by the student, meaning that there were many a person who commited the same scandal as I did. This was in late November of '06 I think the 29th or so), and those of you who are from the same time as me know that the PS3 had come out in that month. My parents had promised to buy me the PS3 if my GPA was above 3.8, but when I got my report card, can you guess what my gpa was? 3.78... My friend, fortunatley, informed me that he had a GPA of 3.9 (he was smart), but the only problem was that we had many different teachers. Now, my parents had much better things to do then to nitpick through certain teachers and grades in certain classes, and since getting a 3.8+ GPA was part of the PS3 deal, I begged my friend to switch report cards with me, since his parents usually didn't have the time to look at his card. I also promised to let him play on the PS3 whenever he came over (he was into FIFA). After some amount of begging he agreed, and things went as planned. I even got an ice cream. fourteen-fifteen years later, I have finally found the courage to admit my scandalous acts. And this is because I also believe my parents might've even known about my treachery.

This took place a little after my birthday when I received a little play tech kit, which was really just a couple circuits, but I absolutely adored this thing. Fast forward to the day after I bought the gum, 24 hours of pure guilt, and my dad had just gotten a massive dumpster ordered to our house for some serious spring cleaning. He basically told us all, get everything we don’t need/want and throw that shit away. So I threw the gum in with the circuitry kit and told him it was broken. He tossed that shit in the dumpster like it was nothin, and on the inside I died. A sad day, but one I won’t forget.

mngcw7,"A few years ago I used to live in an apartment building that was mainly filled with elderly people for tenants or young couples with children. However, people used to drive up to the building to either meet someone or pick someone up. But, there used to be this lady who used to BLARE her music so loud with all her windows down at like 7am, usually on the weekend or rarely during the weekdays. Never turned it down and had it on the whole time until the person they picked up got in, so this would go on for 10-15 minutes sometimes. This went on for weeks if I can remember correctly. So, one day I got fed up and went on my balcony when it was early in the morning and still somewhat dark, and I chucked a beer bottle at her car and ran back in immediately. I remember hearing the bang and the bottle break and looking out the window to see her try to figure out which floor it came from. Looking back on it, it was fucking stupid, especially considering it’s a few minutes of loud music compared to whatever damage the bottle did. It’s just something I was thinking about recently and i do regret it. TL;DR: a lady used to blast music near my apartment so I threw a beer bottle at her car.","When I was in college there was a guy who parked below my bedroom. Almost every morning at like 6am he would go outside to turn on his loud ass car, rev the engine, and blast music through subs for 10-20 min. THEN turn off the car and went back inside.",849
mns2ls,I used to live on the 16th floor of an apartment building. There was a pub on the ground floor and people would often congregate late at night in the street in front of the pub entrance. This was a hinderance to residents because we would wake up at 1 or 2 in morning to drunk people talking outside. My apartment had 2 balconies on 2 sides of the building so I often looked down on people grouping together on both sides of the building. I got fed up with it and decided to drop an egg where a group of people were chatting. They immediately dispersed and i could enjoy my sleep again I did this on another occasion and again it worked. I started buying more eggs and it became a habit that I practiced for about 6 months.

mrbanw,"Back when I was around 8 or 9 I had gotten curious about a lot of things, sexuality being one of them. However, me being a child and now knowing much about search history, and the fact we only had one big family computer, I didn't know how to properly act on this curiosity.  One sunny day my parents and sisters weren't home and my brothers were asleep and I decided that this was the day. I would see my first boob. As I typed all kinds of synonyms into the search bar I quickly learned there was a filter on the results for children, leaving me boobless, but I also quickly learned to take the filter off, and I got to see the boobies. I scrolled a little, typed in specific kinds of boobies, the usual. When I was done viewing them I quickly closed all tabs, played some Barbie dress up, and went on my way to my room. Later that day I hear an argument in the living room. My mom is scolding my brothers. I was only able to make out that she was telling them ""do not EVER do that on the computer downstairs"" ""what were you thinking??"" ""What if the girls(me and my sisters) saw??"". All the while my brothers were constantly denying it. I quickly realised what was going on. I peaked my head inside the room and asked what was going on and my mom quickly told me ""nothing"", and that I should just go to my room. This confirmed it even more. Knowing I had just dodged a bullet, I obliged. My mom saw the search history and assumed my adult brothers were more likely to look up that kind of stuff than her angelic young daughters, and though I definitely agree that my brothers probably consumed that kind of media as well, I am pretty sure they were knowledgeable enough to actually delete their search history after. I will never ask them if they suspected one of us, I will never know if they knew, but something in me knows they knew. I also know they wouldn't be mad knowing all of it was to see some boobies. They would understand. Do I feel bad they got scolded? Yes. Would 8 year old me do it again? Probably. Anyways if you read this I'm sorry bros","This happened to me one time but even worse.

ms7kjg,"My high school football team had occasional team dinners. The parents would alternate hosting the team at their house, and we the players would gorge ourselves on carbs and protein before the game the next day. This particular evening, the hosting family was pretty well-off. They had a beautiful, spacious home, and, I was pleased to see, a secluded bathroom in which to do one's business. I had eaten my fair share of the dinner, and what goes in must come out. These were the days before I'd learned that it doesn't take an entire fistful of toilet paper per wipe to get the job done. I finished my business and flushed, but the payload refused to sink. I searched frantically for a plunger to no avail. I pondered why they didn't keep a plunger in their restroom. Do rich people only take really dainty poops? Now was not the time to contemplate that, I decided, there was an emergency at hand. After a moment of panic, I noticed with relief that the water was draining, albeit slowly. It had drained enough to buy me a second attempt at flushing without overflowing. This time, the product was sucked down out of sight, but the toilet was still clearly backed up. I stayed in the bathroom, trying to collect my composure, and letting the water again slowly drain back to normal levels. There was no evidence remaining from simply looking at the toilet that anything was the matter with it. I fled the scene and rejoined the party. We tossed around a football in the backyard for awhile, but that toilet haunted me like a ghost. A short while later, I noticed a teammate making his way down the hall to the hidden oasis bathroom. I am not a religious man, but I spoke a silent prayer for him. When he resurfaced, true horror was written upon his face. I have no idea what his experience in that bathroom had been like, but it must have been traumatizing. I had laid a landmine for him, perfectly hidden and ready to detonate. I believe that he genuinely thinks he created that mess. Somehow word got around to the host parents that he had clogged up the toilet. The hosts were irate (for some reason. Like lay off guys, he's just a high school kid.) and from what I heard they forced the kid's parents to reimburse them for the plumbing bill. Furthermore, the rest of the team gave him shit (no pun intended) for it for the rest of the year.

muh0j4,"Many years ago, I was standing on one of my balconies when a taxi driver was obnoxiously blowing his horn out front and yelling for a blind man to ""walk toward my voice"" from his own townhouse.

I made the mistake of giving the blind neighbor my phone number so that I could give him a ride in the future. Then the phone calls came... and never stopped. And when I gave him a ride, he would ask for various detours. I'm very calculated by nature, if he had told me beforehand where he wanted to go, it would be cool, but no... we'd be driving along and he'd throw in 2 - 3 extra places on each ride. And it came to be every day that he wanted rides... and he'd even call me to remind me to give him a ride, not that was ever late or backed out. Finally I had enough, so I gauged how blind he was. His response was that he was ""blind as a bat"". A week or two after he said that, I told him I had a job interview in the next city. A week after that, I told him I got the job and was moving away in a month.

n8rviy,"I work for a chain of 24 hour stores. Some time ago(For obvious reasons, I don't want to say exactly how long) I was working overnights. I hated it. It made me fully nocturnal to the point that the sun actually burned my eyes when I went out during the day. I hated the store, hated my town, and hated all of my coworkers. Because of all this, I was bordering on suicidal so I would fantasize about just taking the money and leaving for good while I stocked shelves. Did this every night for months, but I knew jail would be worse so I never did it. Well one day I was venting to a good friend about how I was feeling, basically telling him a lengthier version of that first paragraph. I figured he would tell me I'm going crazy, and I should quit and find a new job I don't hate so much. Instead, he and I came up with the idea to stage a robbery and take the money together. We took about two weeks to plan, and I even called out of one shift so we could hammer out the fine details lmfao The plan was that he would come in wearing a full face mask, long sleeves, and gloves so that you couldn't tell his ethnicity on the cameras. I also knew all of the camera dead spots, so we planned his escape route in such a way he couldn't really be tracked by them. We had the whole thing rehearsed and ready as if we were putting on a play. So the night finally comes, and I had him wait until my coworker went on break so we wouldn't have an extra variable to plan around. He walks in during our deadest time of the night and we start really playing up the whole thing. He's pointing this fake gun in my face, I'm putting my hands up, shaking my head, all that. He has me lead him to the office where he ""makes"" me empty the safe for him, then he has me empty the registers for him on his way out. I give him a few minute head start while I pretend to be rattled and catch my breath, pretend I can't stop shaking enough to dial 911, and finally go alert my coworker that we were robbed and I was too freaked out to do it myself. The cops show up and take my statement. I told them he spoke with an accent that he did not. I fed them a lot of false info to take any suspicion away from my friend. My coworker saw nothing from the breakroom, so he couldn't give any info himself. It's corporate policy to give robbers whatever they want, so I got in no trouble at all. As a matter of fact, they paid me a bonus for handling it so well. They also took me off overnight shifts. Later, I told them I wasn't comfortable here anymore so I put in for a transfer to the town I'd always wanted to live in. That process got expedited due to the situation. I'm not confessing to get it off my chest so much as I am because I couldn't be happier I did it. My life turned around immediately, and I have never been happier since I was a kid. Used the money to finally start college. Tl;dr A friend and I planned a fake robbery of the store I worked at, so we could take the money for ourselves.

She didn't have any reason to be friendly to me... she just was...... Flash forward to a couple of years later. I couldn't conceive that a person could be THAT nice. I thought it had to a cruel joke on her part. So I, in response, said shitty things to her. Still, she seemed to have responded to those shitty things with kindness in return. A couple of months ago, it came to me out of the blue that she actually was genuinely a nice person. And I had bashed her because of this. I still feel like a fucking low-life because of it.  I don't think I did much, but I hope I didn't make it harder for her to be a nice, warm, open person.  I'm so sorry Leah. I'm gonna try to make it up to you in the near future. Only time will reveal the outcome of that, a fact that isn't emotionally easy for me right now...","I have been told I am a very bubbly, joyous, excitable, and enthusiastic. One day this girl told me that when she first met me she thought it was all fake and kinda hated it, but she saw that I was the same with everyone, all the time, and was just genuine. She said it totally changed her mind. For a brief moment I was upset to hear that, but realized it was all the more reason to keep being myself. I don't feel bad and wouldn't want her to feel bad. You shouldn't feel bad. Just be nice too. If you want to apologize, do so. I think she would be happy to hear it. Not happy that you feel guilt, but happy that you recognized something and are now better for it.",809
nl2sjq,"When I was 16 my friend passed away. We ""dated "" when I was 14 and often hooked up every now and then after we broke up. I was really hurt when he passed away believe me.   I went the funeral and for some reason his death really traumatized me. I would visit him frequently and take him flowers often. Eventually I started dating this guy and it was an abusive relationship. One day for some reason I took him to the cemetery to visit my friend. My boyfriend knew this guy when he was alive and knew the circumstances of my relationship with him. We found a pipe at his grave that someone else had left for him and my boyfriend encouraged me to steal it... and I did. We had it for a while until eventually the guilt ate me alive and I returned it to the grave without my boyfriend's knowledge. When he asked about it I said my mom went threw our room (he lived with me at 17) and threw it away. I've never told anyone this. I just need to get it off my chest.",Not sure why you feel bad. Sounds like you just borrowed it for awhile. He’d probably like that you did that.,2134
nv8l0u,"So during my first year of college, I was about 4.5hrs from home and I was broke ofc cause I didn’t have a job (yet). So I lowkey have bad anxiety and hated going to the cafe and eating alone so I’d literally go there as little as possible and stay hungry the rest of the time. So one night my brother sent me his cc info so I could order food (bless him I love him) and I used it but then I kept using it. I also ended up getting my moms cc info and every time I needed an Uber I’d charge it to the card. The Uber rides were so damn expensive I probably racked up hundreds on her card. Anyways, long story short I thought they both couldn’t tell who was charging the card but I ended up feeling guilty so I stopped. A year later I told them it was me and they told me I’m dumb for thinking they wouldn’t know it was me. All in all, they knew and didn’t care lol **Just wanna add that I helped pay it back so y’all don’t go in on me too much",You've got good family. Just remember that whenever they need help or a favor.,1221
